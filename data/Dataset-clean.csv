Assessing the unpaved shoulder of an airport runway for pavement construction using the lightweight penetrometer LRS 10,Runway; Port Harcourt; LRS 10; Penetration index; CBR,,"In upgrading the facilities of an International Airport in Southeastern Nigeria, the runway pavement is to be strengthened by increasing the asphalt concrete overlay thickness and introducing open-graded friction course beneath the overlay. As part of the runway upgrading, the hitherto grassed shoulder will be replaced with full flexible pavement. In evaluating the grassed shoulder a lightweight penetrometer LRS 10 was employed. The LRS 10 was deployed at an interval of 240m on both shoulders. Most part of the shoulder length indicates penetration index (PI) values between 3.57mm/blow and 8.8mm/blow giving equivalent California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values in the range of 79-30% from the ground surface to about 0.40m depth, and higher values of penetration index beyond the 0.40m depth. There are few bands from the ground surface to 0.40m depth in which the PI values are between 9.09 and 33.3mm/blow; with equivalent CBR values of 29-7%, respectively. The LRS 10 also indicate that the shoulders are characterized by soil with medium dense consistencies, with loosely dense soil occurring in those bands with high penetration index values. Soil classification of the shoulder indicates sandy clay, silty sand (SM) soils, except pockets of areas with high penetration index which are characterized with organic clays. Based on this investigation, an Earthworks program was developed for the proposed shoulder pavement construction. Correlation of the two methods of analysis employed to interpret the LRS 10 data leads to resolving one of the major limitations of the LRS 10 penetrometer.",2018
"Wick drains and piling for Cai Mep container port, Vietnam",Wick drain; Full-scale tests; Settlement; Piles,,"A container terminal, Cai Mep port in the Mekong delta approximately 80km southeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, was constructed along the Thi Vai River over about 35m thick soft, deltaic silty clay deposited on dense to compact sand. The port buildings required piled-raft foundations, which were 400-mm square, precast concrete piles driven to 18-28m depth. One building required 760 piles. The seasonal flooding conditions in the area required raising the ground surface by2.5m, which brought about considerable consolidation settlement. To ensure that the settlement would develop before constructing the port area and buildings, the consolidation was accelerated by means of wick drains at a spacing of about 1.2m. Additional fill (surcharge) was placed to raise the ground to a total height of 8-10m. The surcharge was kept on for 6-18months at which time the consolidation was considered to have completed and the piles were constructed. The settlements and amounted to about 3.5m during the surcharge period. Settlement monitoring continued after end of surcharge removal and it became obvious that the area continued to settle after the removal of the surcharge, indicating that consolidation settlement had not been completed despite the long surcharge period. Indeed, the post-construction settlement over general port area would exceed the specified limit: 400mm over a 20-year period. Moreover, which was rather perplexing, when monitoring the settlement of the piled foundations after the pile construction, the piles were found to settle at the same rate as the ground surface already before the buildings had been constructed. A remedial procedure was implemented that involved extending the piles to bear in the sand, where no long-term settlement would occur. The problem and its solution were analyzed by means of the unified design method. The remedial solution did not resolve the settlement problem for the general container storage area, however.",2018
ITER plasma source and building modelling to produce radiation maps,ITER; Tokamak Complex; radiation maps; source modelling; MCNP,SHUTDOWN DOSE-RATE; PORT CELL,"The ITER Tokamak Complex is the civil structure that will host the ITER Tokamak and the largest part of the associated systems. The dimensions are 120 m x 80 m x 60 m, built mostly of concrete, with over one thousand penetrations. During ITER operation, a radiation field will spread throughout the complex from diverse radiation sources. It must be characterized to check the compliance with the limits for electronics allocation and human intervention. However, the production of radiation maps in the ITER Tokamak Complex is a task of paramount sophistication due to challenges to adequately model in MCNP the radiation sources involved. In this work, two important methodological upgrades are presented. First, a new MCNP model of the Tokamak Complex, conceived to be computationally stable while capturing a conservative representation of the baseline. Second, a novel approach to model the plasma source, called a mosaic source, allows an unprecedented degree of realism and accuracy in terms of capturing the port specificities. Both represent a step change in the capacity to produce ITER radiation maps with increased reliability, augmenting previous versions. Examples of partial radiation maps are provided considering both methodological upgrades.",2018
Performance evaluation of steam cured HPC pipe piles produced with metakaolin based mineral additives,Metakaolin; Pipe piles; Pore structure; Phase quantification; Hydration products,SUPPLEMENTARY CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS; DIFFERENT CURING TEMPERATURES; FLY-ASH CONCRETE; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; PORTLAND-CEMENT; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SILICA FUME; EARLY-AGE; HYDRATION KINETICS; PRECAST CONCRETE,"High performance pipe piles are widely used in precast industry. In order to improve the production efficiency and performances of the products, steam curing and mineral admixtures are usually applied. This paper evaluates the performances of HPC pipe piles produced with metakaolin-based admixtures. Quantitative phase composition analysis shows that the addition of 10 wt% metakaolin reduces the port-landite content by up to 57.1%, while increases the content of ettringite to some extent. The addition of metakaolin or metakaolin-slag/limestone blends improves the mechanical properties, especially the hybrid usage of metakaolin and limestone filler. Pore structure and microscope analyze confirm the remarkably-refined pore characteristics caused by the addition of metakaolin-based admixtures, in which case the gel pores accounts up to 85% of the total pores. Those remarkably improved properties caused by the addition of metakaolin-based admixtures indicate a promising future for their applications in producing high performance pipe piles with further modified properties.

Beyond the Enclave of Urban Theory,Urban theory; methodology; global urbanism; Stuart Hall; race; cities; urbanization; Buenaventura; Colombia,STUART HALL; CITY; RACE; URBANIZATION; GEOGRAPHIES; DIFFERENCE; BLACKNESS; COLOMBIA,"This essay offers a methodological intervention into conceptual debates in urban studies. Despite significant analytical and political differences across an otherwise heterodox field of inquiry, these debates have been overly confined to a theoretical register. In this essay, I propose an alternative, inspired by Stuart Hall, which focuses on the concrete work accomplished by our key concepts in specific historical conjunctures. I make this argument with reference to my own research in Colombia, focusing specifically on racialized violence and displacement in the port-city of Buenaventura. I argue that Hall's method, particularly his work on 'race', offers a way to engage questions of global urbanism without necessarily treating them as theoretical questions. Like 'race' in Hall's analysis, concepts like the 'urban' and the 'global' are 'articulating principles' of social formations, producing both discursive and material effects, and possessing social, cultural and political lives of their own. Alongside efforts to democratize the privilege of thinking and speaking in the language of 'theory', Hall's method exposes that privilege to more fundamental questioning.",2018
Atmospheric corrosion study in a harbor located in a tropical island,atmospheric corrosion; harbor; tropical climate,MILD-STEEL; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; MARINE AEROSOLS; SALINITY; DEPOSITION; TRANSPORT; EXPOSURE; REGIME; HAVANA; BRAZIL,"Atmospheric corrosion level in tropical coastal zones is usually very significant. Corrosion control and preservation of infrastructure in these regions is very important to increase durability. Atmospheric corrosion of carbon steel, copper, galvanized steel, and aluminum was evaluated in a coastal industrial port zone located in a tropical island during 1 year. Samples were exposed at seven outdoor corrosion sites located at different distances from the sea. Main atmospheric pollutants, relative humidity, and air temperature were monitored during the exposure time. The existence of a combination between two of the most aggressive atmosphere types was determined (coastal-industrial and industrial-coastal). Changes in RH and temperature influenced significantly the chloride deposition. A new statistical model to explain the influence of time of exposure for all metals tested was developed. A possible antagonist effect between pollutants on corrosion may be possible. Acceleration of corrosion rate vs time is observed in the site close to the shoreline. Significant differences between corrosivity categories determined and those calculated by ISO standard dose response functions were found. The narrow entrance of the harbor with low movement of the inner water causes a decrease in salinity in the port zone.",2018
Renewable energy cooperatives: Facilitating the energy transition at the Port of Rotterdam,Renewable energy; Energy cooperatives; Port of Rotterdam; Energy transition; Smart energy markets,CHALLENGES; CLUSTERS,"Renewable energy cooperatives (RECs) are an important element of the European energy transition. Allowing citizens and companies to invest in renewable energy and thereby become independent power producers has advanced the acceptance of renewable energy among the population, accelerating the move toward a more decentralized and sustainable power supply. We investigate how a REC could be designed to increase renewable energy deployment at the Port of Rotterdam. Based on a progressive case study conducted among a wide array of stakeholders at the Port and across Europe, we have found 14 specific characteristics a REC should embody to facilitate the energy transition at the Port. Based on these results, we present an action plan with concrete recommendations on how a successful cooperative could be launched at the Port. The results of this research can serve as a guide for stakeholders in any industrial cluster interested in driving the energy transition through a REC.",2018
Properties of Plain Concrete Produced Employing Recycled Aggregates and Sea Water,Mixed recycled aggregate; Sea water; Blast furnace cement; Recycled concrete; Properties,COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; STRUCTURAL CONCRETE; HYDRATION PRODUCTS; PERFORMANCE; DURABILITY; SLAG; CONSTRUCTION; ENVIRONMENT; RESISTANCE; CEMENT,"The generation of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) is a noteworthy environmental and economic concern. The development of new applications in which Recycled Mixed Aggregates (RMA) can be used will lead to a reduction of landfills growth. Moreover, the use of seawater shall represent another advance in sustainability due to the consequent reduction of fresh water consumption, which can be a limited resource in certain areas. Although seawater is not generally recommended for concrete production, especially in reinforced concretes, seawater could be a viable replacement for fresh water in the production of plain concretes. This study intends to analyse the possibility of using RMA and seawater in the production of concrete to be used in port sites. This study is based on three different parameters: cement class, water source and RMA content. The results highlighted the beneficial effects of using type III cement, especially with regard to durability properties. The concretes produced employing RMA and type III cement achieved lower value of sorptivity coefficient and higher values of ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), chloride ion penetration resistance and electrical resistivity than those produced with natural aggregates and type I cement. Moreover, the use of seawater in concretes with type III cement not only produced higher density and lower absorption capacity but also higher mechanical properties by creating a denser cement matrix, which proved to suffer low decrease by RMA addition.",2018
Consolidation Behavior of Fly Ash-Based Geopolymer-Stabilized Dredged Mud,Consolidation; Dredged mud; Fly ash; Geopolymer; Stabilization; Land reclamation,MARINE CLAY; SOIL; CEMENT; LIME; SEDIMENTS,"Ports use soft dredged material for land reclamation to address land scarcity and environmental constraints. Land reclaimed with soft dredged material has the properties of high compressibility and slow consolidation that need to be improved. This laboratory study investigated the effect of a fly ash-based geopolymer binder on the consolidation behavior of soft dredged mud derived from the Port of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. For geopolymer synthesization, an alkali activator solution to aluminosilicate source material mix designs that is used in the geopolymer concrete industry was adopted. The dredged mud sediments were reconstituted at 400% water content dredged mud slurries of nontreated and geopolymer stabilized at 6, 12, and 18% by weight. A series of standard one-dimensional consolidation tests was conducted to study the consolidation and compressibility characteristics of the dredged mud sediments. Taylor's square root of time curve-fitting method was used to estimate the coefficient of consolidation. The study found that the fly ash-based geopolymer stabilization improved the compressibility, permeability, and consolidation characteristics of the dredged mud sediments. The findings indicate the feasibility of stabilizing dredged mud while still in its slurry form. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2018

This paper presented series of experimental studies on the influence of MS characteristics on MS concrete performance. Results indicated that the particle shape of MS had little influence on the performance of its concretes, while the stone powder of MS had more remarkable influence on its concrete performance. When the gradations of manufactured sand B (MSB) and RS was adjusted according to Fuller's curve, the strength of MSB concrete was only lower than that of RS concrete, thus the gradation of MS was not a negative characteristic to concrete strength. The stone powder of MS is most significant factor on its concrete strength and the strength can reach a peak value when the content of stone powder is 7.5%. The MSB concrete has narrower ITZ than that of RS, and only a small amount of AFt crystals is found in the 117 of MSB, while the stick AFt, AFm and port-landite crystal are enriched at the ITZ of RS concrete, the microstructure of MSB concrete is denser than that of RS.

Yet do we really know its origin? Since Julius Caesar used this technology in Brindisi (Italy) up to the Normandy landings in June 1944, not only has this technology been developed, but it has been a key item in several moments in history. Its development has almost always been driven by military requirements. The greatest changes have not been conceptual but point occurring, backed by the materials used. Parallelisms can be clearly seen in each new stage: timber, opus caementitium (Roman concrete), iron and concrete... However, nowadays, achieving a more sustainable world constitutes a major challenge, to which the construction of caissons breakwaters must contribute as a field of application of new eco-friendly materials. This research work provides a general overview from the origins of caissons until our time. It will make better known the changes that took place in the system and their adaptation to new materials, and will help in clarifying the future in developing technology towards composite sustainable materials and special concrete.

Development of a particle swarm optimisation model for estimating the homogeneity of a mixture inside a newly designed CNG-H-2-AIR mixer for a dual fuel engine: An experimental and theoretic study,Homogeneity of the mixture; AIR-CNG-hydrogen mixer; Internal combustion engines; Computational fluid dynamics; Particle swarm optimisation,SPARK-IGNITION ENGINE; HEAVY-DUTY ENGINE; NATURAL-GAS CNG; DIESEL-ENGINE; EMISSION CHARACTERISTICS; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; GASEOUS EMISSIONS; HYDROGEN ADDITION; PORT-INJECTION; COMBUSTION,"Many research works have intended to enhance fuel economy and decrease emissions during conversion from a diesel engine to a dual fuel engine. However, the majority of these works do not take into account enhancement of homogeneity of the mixture inside the engine and precise control of the air fuel ratio. This deficiency can cause higher emissions, greater brake-specific fuel consumption, and likely knocking. Conversely, there is limited research pertaining to empirical equations for projecting the mixture's homogeneity. In this study, a new air-fuel mixer was devised, produced and tested. For the air-gaseous fuel mixer, the proposed design was meant to be appropriate for mixing air with hydrogen and CNG. It was also designed in such a way that it would result into extremely homogeneous mixing for the gaseous fuel as it mixes with air and exhibits high uniformity index (UI). Lastly, it is also meant to promote easy connection with an electronic control unit so that the air-gaseous fuel ratio could be accurately controlled for varying engine speeds. To optimise the homogeneity within the new mixer, fifteen varying mixer models having 116 cases were made in order to study how the location, diameter, and number of holes within the mixer affect the mixture's homogeneity and distribution under ACNGR = 34.15 and AHR = 74.76. Afterwards, the distribution, flow behaviour, and homogeneity of the mixture within the new mixer models were checked using computational fluid dynamics analysis software. Based on the simulation results, it was discovered that the best uniformity index (UI) values were achieved for models 7/ case 48. Based on the simulation results, a fairly simple method was then developed to estimate the mixture's homogeneity (UI) from the new models of the mixer. The basis of the proposal model (empirical equation) is from the best values determined for the unknown constant F so that the equation for UI estimation could be formulated. The particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm was used to solve an optimisation problem and achieve this outcome. The outcomes indicated that the built model could precisely project the UI values.",2018
Experimental testing for Zarzis port sediments (Tunisia) in road materials,geotechnical engineering/ports; docks & harbours/roads & highways,MARINE DREDGED SEDIMENTS; SCALE EXPERIMENT; CLAY; CONSTRUCTION; DURABILITY; CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR; CEMENT; HARBOR; SOIL,"This study focused on the feasibility of Tunisian sediment reuse as new road material. Experiments were conducted to investigate sediment reuse as road material. Three mixtures (raw sediments, stabilised sediments with 3% lime and stabilised sediments with 3% cement) were studied with regard to their mechanical performances. The first part of this paper introduces the characterisation of Zarzis sediments. The second part describes the laboratory experiments and the followed methods. The third part is dedicated to the analysis of results. The originality of this work is the use of a minimum percentage of lime, which was determined experimentally. Based on environmental tests, Zarzis sediments were uncontaminated. Thus, they can be reused directly without a decontamination treatment process. Results show that humic compounds complicated sediment treatment with cement. Therefore, cement did not present an appropriate binder for stabilising and solidifying the investigated sediments. Based on mechanical results, a mixture with 3% lime can be used as new road material.",2018
Application of Simplified Deterioration Diagnosis Method to Existing Fishing Port Facilities,,CONCRETE,"For the efficient maintenance of a large number of fishing port facilities distributed over various locations, establishment of simple deterioration diagnosis method with acceptable precision is needed. In this study, the applicability of the rebound method and the mechanical impedance method to the existing fishing port facilities was examined with laboratory tests focusing on the effect of testing conditions, measurement positions, aggregate contents on compressive strength, and influence of polishing of the test surfaces followed by in-situ surveys. As a result, the mechanical impedance method showed an acceptable precision as compared with the rebound method and was able to easily estimate compressive strength without polishing the test surfaces. It was very likely that the mechanical impedance method could be highly applicable to deterioration diagnosis method for the existing fishing port facilities.",2018
Information function of civil budget,Information; Access to information; Budget; Civil budget; The budget of the electron; The interests of the population,,"Purpose The formation of an information society in Russia requires new approaches in the implementation of citizen's rights to access information. At a modern time, when the resources of internet are available to almost everyone, the modern financial and legal institutions adapt or are obliged to adapt to the modern model of the information society. Not so long ago, just at the beginning of the twenty-first century, new information and legal concept - Civil budget - was introduced. The authors tried to show concrete examples of what it is, what it is, its structure and principles. The authors believe that the realization of the idea of a Civic budget in the Russian Federation will increase the accessibility of information for citizens about the financial performance and financial state and municipalities will allow the State itself, through its Government and the Parliament, to form the budget, based not only on macroeconomic goals and objectives of the country, and objectives of each, even the most small territorial unit in accordance with the needs of living of its citizens. Design/methodology/approach The problem is not new and, in one way or another, exists in all States, but many countries have undertaken very effective reforms and have made improvements in the situation. For example, in Brazil, in the city of Port Alegre, a budget initiative was launched in 1990. Then, it was replicated in 400 prefectures throughout the country. The procedure begins with the assembly of residents of the district, where citizens discuss and outline budget priorities, and ends with the approval of the city budget by delegates directly elected at district assemblies. The success achieved in Porto Alegre was further spread: in 1996-2000, budgeting options were implemented in 100 municipal districts, including SAo Paulo. In 2000-2004, it is estimated to be implemented in another 250 municipalities. Findings The access of the population to budget information is a positive factor not only from the point of view of budgetary law but also in the legal field of information law. Such an opportunity is a direct implementation of principles of the industry such as the principle of publicity and the principle of priority of individual rights. State bodies that form and execute the state budget are, initially, already subjects of the information law, but the above-mentioned activities for monitoring, collecting and providing information within the framework of the Civil budget concept lead them to a new qualitative level of rights and obligations within the framework of information relations, which is unquestionably a positive factor for the activities of these bodies. Originality/value The authors believe that the realization of the idea of a Civic budget in the Russian Federation will increase the accessibility of information for citizens about the financial performance and financial state, and municipalities will allow the State itself, through its Government and the Parliament, to form the budget, based not only on macroeconomic goals and objectives of the country, and objectives of each, even the most small territorial unit in accordance with the needs of living of its citizens.",2018

Main issues of pile foundation at waterfront development and its prevention method,,DREDGED SEDIMENTS; STRENGTH,"Pile foundation is widely used in construction and building marine structures. This is because pile foundation is an important structure and should have long-term durability. However, in waterfront development, a lot of issues from the seawater should be considered distinctively because it consists of many problems that can affect the building structure especially the foundation of the building. Thus, a research should be conducted to identify issues of pile foundation at waterfront development and determine its prevention methods. The research was carried out through interviews with the developers and contractors from the projects of Lexis Hibiscus at Port Dickson, Negeri Sembilan and Redevelopment for Deep-Water Facilities at Quay 6 in Pasir Gudang, Johor, Malaysia. The objectives of this research are to identify issues of pile foundation and to determine the prevention methods of pile foundation issues at waterfront development. All respondents agreed that the main issues of pile foundations at waterfront development are the wave and tide condition. The prevention methods of the issue faced at waterfront development that are most frequently used for the pile foundation are coating system and concrete cover. This research is beneficial to all developers and contractors to ensure pile foundations at waterfront development can be protected by using the prevention methods.",2018
Economic assessment of the alternative energy sources implementation for port enterprises,Sea Port; Maritime Activity; Alternative Energy Sources; Renewable Energy Sources; Wind Power; Solar Power,PV PANELS,"The purpose of this article is to explore specific features of the implementation of alternative energy sources used to ensure activities of Ukrainian port companies. A considerable development of the alternative energy industry in Ukraine is connected to a relatively loyal legislation, state support and tax benefits for companies which employ it. Diversification of energy sources contributes primarily to decreasing risks, however, from the economic point, the choice of concrete sources appears to be more efficient for port companies. Thus, it is suggested to install solar collectors and wind stations to facilitate port activities. According to our calculations, the implementation of the innovative investment project regarding solar panels is justified. The economic effect of installation of solar collectors and wind stations is estimated at UAH 3,107,667.00 (USD 194,230.00) and UAH 1,022,093.00 (USD 63,880.00), respectively. The use of both options is economically feasible in the modern conditions. However, the economic benefit from the wind stations is significantly less. It can be explained by the fact that equipment for wind stations is much more expensive, and its installation and maintenance are more sophisticated and costly. A much bigger quantity of solar panels is needed to provide electricity for the whole port, yet the cost of their installation and maintenance is considerably lower.",2017
SOME CONSIDERATIONS ON BERTH PRODUCTIVITY REFERRED ON DRY BULK CARGOES IN A MULTIPURPOSE SEAPORT,berth; productivity; ship turnaround time,,"Productivity at the berth is one from the group of port productivity measures which is closely tied to ship turnaround times. Gross berth productivity between a ship's arrival and departure from berth is among the broadest definitions of productivity. Net berth productivity is value of productivity related to the operational time at the berth. Based on the recognized facts from available literature about minor share of researches related to the berth productivity in the handling process with dry bulk cargoes in a multipurpose seaport, it was decided to take this port productivity metrics as an object of a research. Concrete results shown in this paper are related to the Dry Bulk Cargo Terminal in the Port of Bar. By the consideration done in this paper is confirmed starting hypothesis about significant differences between gross and net berth productivity (about significant share of nonoperational time in the total berthing time).",2017
Comparison of chloride penetration into surface-treated concrete in artificial and natural environments,chloride diffusion coefficients; chloride ion profiles; in situ components; surface chloride contents; surface treatment,SERVICE LIFE PREDICTION; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; MARINE ENVIRONMENTS; INDUCED CORROSION; DIFFUSION-COEFFICIENT; COATINGS; TEMPERATURE; PERFORMANCE; DURABILITY; EXPOSURE,This study investigated the penetration of chloride into surface-treated high-performance concrete and normal concrete in natural and accelerated environments. Both high-performance concrete and normal concrete were applied in a real port. Concrete specimens that were cast together with the concrete port were transported to the laboratory and subjected to wetting and drying cycles with NaCl solution. The chloride contents of the specimens in the laboratory and the in situ components were tested. The chloride diffusion coefficients and surface chloride contents were calculated based on Fick's second law. The results show that high-performance concrete and surface treatment clearly slow the chloride penetration into the concrete both in the laboratory and in situ. The chloride contents on the surface and in the concrete in the components of the concrete port are higher during the summer than during the winter. The chloride penetration performance in the concrete of real structures cannot be inferred from its performance in specimens under artificial environments in the laboratory.,2017
Land Masking Methods of Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery for Ship Detection Considering Coastline Changes and Noise,Land Masking; Sentinel-1; Ship Detection; Synthetic Aperture Radar,,"Since land pixels often generate false alarms in ship detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), land masking is a necessary step which can be processed by a land area map or water database. However, due to the continuous coastline changes caused by new port, bridge, etc., an updated data should be considered to mask either the land or the oceanic part of SAR. Furthermore, coastal concrete facilities make noise signals, mainly caused by side lobe effect. In this paper, we propose two methods. One is a semi-automatic water body data generation method that consists of terrain correction, thresholding, and median filter. Another is a dynamic land masking method based on water database. Based on water database, it uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find and mask noise signals from coastal concrete facilities. We verified our methods using Sentinel-1 SAR data. The result shows that proposed methods remove maximum 84.42% of false alarms.",2017
Effect of Particle Packing and Fly Ash on Performance of Ordinary Portland Cement/Anhydrite-Activated Ground-Granulated Blast-Furnace Slag,aggregates; anhydrite; compressive strength; flow; fly ash; ground-granulated blast-furnace slag; ordinary portland cement; particle packing; pH,CHEMICAL ACTIVATORS; POZZOLANIC REACTION; CEMENT; STRENGTH,"A common practice to produce concrete with a lowered CO2 embodiment is to use high levels of supplemental cementitious materials (SCMs), such as slag and fly ash, in place of port-land cement, which is an economical and low-cost procedure. However, problems with activation arise that lead to low strength development, especially at an early age. This paper is focused on the influence of optimizing particle packing, which would decrease the cement/aggregate ratio while optimizing the space in the cement matrix; and on the effect of different fly ashes on the strength development of ordinary portland cement (OPC)/anhydrite-activated ground-granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) cement. The optimized particle packing demonstrated to have a significant impact on the mechanical properties, both at early and late compressive strengths, compared with the nonpacking compositions. Substitution of fly ash for ultrafine aggregates significantly affected the mechanical properties, as well as the hydrates formed during the hydration process, depending on the fly ash properties.",2017
Mechanical Performance Monitoring for Prestressed Concrete Piles Used in a Newly- Built High-Piled Wharf in a Harbor with Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor Technology When Pile Driving,pile-driving monitoring; high-piled wharf; FBG; strain; prestressed concrete pile,STRAIN SENSOR,"Mechanical performance monitoring of civil infrastructure using fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors has received significant public attention in recent years. However, there is currently little research on the mechanical performance monitoring of piles used in high-piled wharfs in coastal ports during pile driving using the FBG sensor technique. Based on the properties of precast prestressed concrete piles used in high-piled wharfs in coastal ports and servicing seawater environments, and the benefits of FBG sensors, the mechanical performance monitoring for precast prestressed concrete piles used in a newly-built high-piled wharf in the Tianjin Port of China is devised and deployed with the FBG sensor technique. To conduct performance monitoring of the precast prestressed concrete pile, a state-of-the-art FBG strain sensor, which is less thermosensitive and does not require temperature compensation, was used to monitor the strain status of different locations of the pile. In one pile, three of this kind of strain sensor were set near the head, middle and tip of the pile, and one FBG angle sensor was set near the head of the pile to measure the dip angle of the pile. During the testing, data were recorded for all of the details of the pile driving process. According to the data analysis, it is clear that the compressive strain at the middle of the pile during driving is larger than that near the head and tip of the pile. Therefore, the middle of the prestressed concrete pile is the key location that should be preferentially monitored during pile driving. Meanwhile, when the hammer impacts the pile continuously, the obvious tension strain at the tip of the pile increases and the maximum dynamic tension strain reaches 56 mu epsilon, which approaches the tension ultimate strain. This occurs because the frictional resistance of soil is small in the middle of the pile when the tip meets the significant supporting soil layer. This study can provide a reference for the mechanical performance monitoring deployment of precast prestressed concrete piles used in high-piled wharf structures in coastal ports.",2017
Quantum simulation of discrete-time Hamiltonians using directionally unbiased linear optical multiports,,SCATTERING-THEORY; WALKS; PHYSICS; GRAPHS,"Recently, a generalization of the standard optical multiport was proposed [Phys. Rev. A 93, 043845 (2016)]. These directionally unbiased multiports allow photons to reverse direction and exit backwards from the input port, providing a realistic linear optical scattering vertex for quantum walks on arbitrary graph structures. Here, it is shown that arrays of these multiports allow the simulation of a range of discrete-time Hamiltonian systems. Examples are described, including a case where both spatial and internal degrees of freedom are simulated. Because input ports also double as output ports, there is substantial savings of resources compared to feed-forward networks carrying out the same functions. The simulation is implemented in a scalable manner using only linear optics, and can be generalized to higher dimensional systems in a straightforward fashion, thus offering a concrete experimentally achievable implementation of graphical models of discrete-time quantum systems.",2017
IMPLEMENTATION OF SPATIAL INFORMATION FOR MONITORING AND ANALYSIS OF THE AREA AROUND THE PORT USING LASER SCANNING TECHNIQUES,spatial information; monitoring of the area around the port; terrestrial and airborne laser scanning,PHOTOGRAMMETRY; INTEGRATION; CONCRETE,"Nowadays, maritime infrastructure is heavily exploited, which requires monitoring. The article presents the implementation of spatial information which are point clouds for monitoring and analysis of the area around the port (buildings and wharves). For this study, point clouds coming from terrestrial (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS), each of them having different accuracy, were used. An important part of the analysis was the integration of the two data sources. Through integration, the acquisition of information on areas not covered by the measurement in the presented case, one of the methods was possible for use (e.g. the roofs in case of TLS, or the lack of some of the walls of buildings in case of ALS). Another aspect was to use this data. Measurement of the shape and geometry of objects was executed. Additionally, the planeness analysis of individual elements of port infrastructure has been carried out. An interesting analysis was to determine the water level, based on relation to specific characteristics of the light reflectance.",2017
"Experimental and nonlinear numerical analysis of underwater housings for the deep sea, made of ultra-high performance concrete",ANSYS; concrete pressure housing; hollow cylinder; hydrostatic loading; multiaxial pressure; multiPlas; nonlinear analysis; shell; UHPC,,"The paper describes the design and analysis of underwater housings made of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) within the Helmholtz Alliance ""ROBEX"" to provide cost-efficient alternatives to expensive titanium housings. The research is related to former investigations on spherical and cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure made of normal strength concrete, performed from 1960 to 1980 at the Civil Engineering Laboratory, Port Hueneme, California. Several housings made of UHPC have been manufactured and the short-term implosion resistance has been determined experimentally. Since neither the mechanical equations for thin-or thick-walled shells nor the empirical equations for implosion pressure of shells made of normal strength concrete by Albertsen can describe the behavior sufficiently, two nonlinear material laws for concrete, multiPlas Law 9 (modified Willam-Warnke model) and Law 14 (Menetrey-Willam model) by Dynardo for ANSYS, have been calibrated with results from uni-and biaxial strength tests, and the results of nonlinear finite element model with ANSYS 16 have been compared. To study the long-term behavior, an in situ test is currently being performed at 2,500-m depth in the Arctic Sea.",2017
Modelling the Behaviour of an Open-ended Coaxial Probe to Assess the Permittivity of Heterogeneous Dielectrics Solids,,CONCRETE,"The study presents the development of a new two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model describing the operation of a large open-ended coaxial probe. This numerical simulation, combined with a capacitive approach describing the behaviour of the system, enabled to prove the suitability of such device to determine the permittivity of homogeneous dielectric solids over the frequency range [1MHz; 4GHz]. Finding back the permittivity of a specified material thanks to the simulation is achieved by calculating the input port reflection coefficients S-11 at the TEM wave emission port. A capacitive model is then applied to calculate a permittivity value. Very good matching between set and calculated dielectric constants is a first noticeable result. Measurements performed onto different homogeneous materials like rocks also show good similarities with the numerical simulations. A comparison between measurements and simulations obtained for samples with different electromagnetic properties can therefore be used as a very simple way to calculate permittivity of dielectrics solids. This study is not restricted to homogeneous solids. Measurements performed onto heterogeneous samples like a dry sand made up by crushing a homogeneous rock are compared to FEM simulations with different dielectric constants set as an entry of the calculus. Permittivity of the heterogeneous material is thereby deduced and compared to different mixing laws estimating the effective permittivity of a media made of heterogeneities dispersed into a matrix with different electromagnetic properties. Good matching between dielectric constants resulting from specific effective medium theories and measurements performed onto a dry sand is obtained.",2017
Research on Control Strategy of Wind Power Generation System Based on Four - port Electromechanical Converter,Four-port electromechanical converter; Wind power; Fuzzy control,,"Wind power generation system based on four-port electromechanical converter (FPEC) is a new wind power system, which overcomes the shortcomings of many traditional wind power generation systems. According to its working mode and operating characteristics, this paper proposes an improved system control strategy as well as the concrete realization method based on fuzzy logic, which improves the energy management of wind power generation system. After the detailed theoretical analysis, this paper builds out the simulation model of fuzzy controller of the wind power generation system based on FPEC in MATLAB, describing the wind power generation system control based on fuzzy logic. The fuzzy controller has enhanced the robustness and flexibility of the wind power control system, and it lay the foundations for the development of this new wind power system.",2017
"Real-time, Non-instrusive Instrumentation and Monitoring of Standards-based Event-based Applications",Component Port Monitor; event-based systems; dynamic binary instrumentation; Pin; Pin plus; CORBA Component Model,,"This paper presents an approach for non-instrusively instrumenting standards-based event-based middle-ware. The approach has been realized in an open-source tool called Component Port Monitor (CPM). CPM uses dynamic binary instrumentation as a means to monitor events published between software components. This allows CPM to operate in contexts without any a priori knowledge of the concrete events in the system, or how the system is composed. We have applied CPM to applications implemented in the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). Our results show that once the application is completely instrumented, the performance impact of actually monitoring events is minimal, requiring an additional 2.5 milliseconds.",2017
Shielding Design for the South Pole nToF Diagnostic at the NIF,,,"Neutron time of flight (nToF) detectors are fielded at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) to measure neutron yield, ion temperature, and downscattering in the cold fuel for D-T implosions. Anisotropically assembled cold fuel may generate different nToF data when measured by detectors located at the Target Chamber equator and poles. A collimated nToF line of sight has been fielded near the Target Chamber South Pole (SP) to examine any possible anisotropy in the cold fuel. The SP nToF detector is located in the lowest floor level of the NIF's Target Bay and at a distance of similar to 18 m from the Target Chamber Center. The detector utilizes a solid bibenzyl scintillator and four photomultiplier tubes. The line of sight includes a port collimator that is attached to the Target Chamber and a bore hole collimator in the concrete floor above the detector. In addition, a beam line get lost hole is constructed in the Target Bay floor to minimize the backscattered radiation at the detector location. Initial measurements indicated the need for installation of additional shielding to eliminate gamma background during the period before arrival of the 14.1 MeV neutrons to the detector. A set of MCNP Monte Carlo simulations with the full Target Bay model were conducted to provide an estimate of the expected neutron and gamma backgrounds during D-T shots. A new shielding scheme is designed to reduce the gamma background by an order of magnitude.",2017
Load Tests of the Movable Footbridge over the Port Canal in Ustka,civil engineering; testing; computer simulation; footbridge,CABLE-STAYED BRIDGE; INSTRUMENTATION; SENSORS,"This paper presents the acceptance tests earned out on the open footbridge over the port canal in the Port of Ustka. The steel footbridge construction is created by a single pylon to which a movable truss span is suspended with a theoretical span of 52.3 m. The studies about load test of the object included static and dynamic extortion and measurements. In static tests the ballast was of pallets with concrete blocks. Dynamic studies were earned out by extortions induced by a group of pedestrians in various combinations. Structural behavior was recorded using geodetic techniques - displacement and settlement of supports, strain gages - strain and force in lines and accelerometers - acceleration. The measured parameters were consistent with the theoretical values. Tests ended with a positive result that allows putting the footbridge in use with the design assumptions.",2017
Manufacturing of Emergency Repair Pipe for 210 '' Irrigation Siphon,,,"On Friday, May 13th, 2016, the 210-inch diameter Kutz Siphon failed, cutting off the irrigation water to 72,000 acres of farmland. Faced with millions of dollars in crop losses, the Navajo Agricultural Products Industry needed replacement pieces for 40 feet of 210-inch prestressed concrete cylinder pipe (PCCP) quickly. The original PCCP was manufactured onsite in the early 1970s as transporting the pipe would have been a significant challenge. Needing the repair pieces in a timely manner, the manufacturer worked closely with the Bureau of Reclamation to design a solution for which material acquisition, manufacturing, and delivery could be completed in a timely manner. The design solution was to use steel plate and roll up the replacement pieces in short segments that could be hauled as over-width loads, eliminating any over-height issues. Reclamation provided a previously used detail for connection to the existing PCCP. The joints for the repair pieces were designed as buttstraps in lieu of banded bells to facilitate joining of pipe in field. A port was provided for access and ventilation during installation. Paper will cover the steps taken and coordination required to provide the repair pieces in a short time period.",2017

The European fortifications on the coast of the Pacific Ocean,marine fortress; architecture; Pacific Ocean; Port Arthur; Vladivostok,,"In the Russian Empire during XIX and early XX centuries, fortresses were built and strengthened along the frontiers. We studied the architecture of the Far Eastern Russian cities-fortresses using as examples Nikolaevsk-on-Amur, Port Arthur (now Luishun) and mainly Vladivostok. Coastal fortresses significantly influenced the urban development of the Far Eastern cities. The architectural peculiarity of the fortress architecture at that period was associated with the transition from the brick and stone fortifications to the complex systems of monolithic reinforced concrete. In 1860, a military post with the expressive and geopolitically ambitious name ""Vladivostok"" (""Possess the East"") was established. By the beginning of the XX century, Vladivostok became a rapidly growing city of the European culture and one of the most powerful marine fortresses in the world. The Vladivostok Fortress was an innovative project in early XX century and has distinctive features of the modern style (Art Nouveau), partly of the Russian and classical style in architecture, as well as an organic unity with the surrounding landscape. Plastic architectural masses with their non-linear shape are typical of the fortifications of Vladivostok. Vast and branching internal communication spaces link fort buildings, scattered on the surface and remote from each other. Huge, monumental forts located on the tops of mountains and fitted perfectly in the landscape are successful examples of landscape architecture. The Vladivostok Fortress was the last huge marine citadel of the Russian Empire but not completed and turned into a Utopia. Now Vladivostok Fortress is proclaimed a monument to the past and architecture of the Russian Federation. Today, after nearly 100 years, a new large-scale innovative program for Vladivostok is being implemented, with the development of the adjacent island territories and the construction of modern large-span bridges.",2017
Study of pitting resistance of rebar steels in Jakarta coastal using simulated concrete pore solution,Reinforcing steel; pitting corrosion; jakarta coastal sea water; simulated concrete pore solution; carbonates,CORROSION; REINFORCEMENT,"Carbon steels are generally used to a reinforcement in the concrete constructions, such as bridges, piling, etc. These constructions are not a bit placed in the coastal areas, especially the coastal area of Jakarta. The industrial activities and urban development were a source of sediment loads and pollutants in coastal sea water Jakarta. The presence of chloride content and pollutants in sea water could affect the process of corrosion of reinforcement steel in concrete especially pitting corrosion. In this paper, the behavior of pitting corrosion of reinforcement steel in sea water of Jakarta coastal using simulated concrete pore solution has been studied. The sea waters were taken from two different locations of Jakarta coastal, Ancol beach and Muara Barn fishing port. Each of the sea water was used as a solvent in the simulated concrete pore solution with or without carbonates. The simulated concrete pore solution with chloride was also utilized for comparison test. The cyclic and potentiostatic electrochemical polarization were conducted to evaluate the behavior of pitting corrosion of reinforcing steel. The experimental results showed that the reinforcing steel was susceptible to pitting corrosion in the simulated concrete pore solutions (SPS) of sea water with or without carbonates and in the simulated concrete pore solutions containing 3.5% NaCl. The addition of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate in SPS of sea water increased the breakdown potential value and the total time for the metastable pitting decreased slightly.

PILOT-SCALE DENITRIFICATION BIOREACTORS FOR REPLICATED FIELD RESEARCH,Woodchip bioreactor; Nitrate; Tile drainage; Hydraulic retention time; Hydraulic properties; Tracer test,NITRATE REMOVAL; DENITRIFYING BIOREACTORS; PERFORMANCE; MEDIA; WATER; TEMPERATURE; HYDRAULICS; EFFICIENCY,"Carbon-based denitrification bioreactors are designed to intercept tile drainage and are a promising technology for reducing NO3- export to surface water. While these systems have been tested extensively in the laboratory, the ability to study in-field bioreactors under controlled conditions with statistical replicates has been limited. Nine pilot-scale bioreactors (5.79 x 1.05 x 1.07 m) were designed and installed for systematic field testing, allowing for variation in retention time, fill material, and influent water quality parameters. Each bioreactor is constructed from a concrete trench in-line with influent flow control, dosing port, flow diffusion, and effluent water level control. Sampling ports are installed at two points in each bioreactor for access to water samples or fill materials. A potassium bromide (KBr) tracer study was conducted and Morrill Dispersion Index (MDI) values averaged 2.8 +/- 0.3, indicating plug flow characteristics. The average tracer residence time (t) was 2.3 +/- 0.3 h, in close agreement with the estimated hydraulic retention time (HRT) value of 2.1 +/- 0.3 h, which was calculated using a porosity value of 0.70. Hydraulic efficiency was good (lambda = 0.78 +/- 0.03) and there was no evidence of short circuiting (S = 0.73 +/- 0.03). This system is expected to provide useful insight regarding design for improved field performance of denitrification bioreactors.",2017

Along the sea bottom, 650 m off and -7 m depth, a Campanian Ignimbrite bedrock was detected: dated similar to 39 kyr BP, its position is incompatible with the current sea level. Towards the northern edge of the shoal, a depressed area with 24 cubic elements in concrete was surveyed. These artefacts (pilae) are typical of Roman maritime structures widespread along the southernmost Phlegrean coast. Beachrocks and accessory landforms at the same depth of bedrock suggest that this was emerging and attended by man in Roman times, even for activities related to port facilities. Submerged palaeo-channels, in alignment of current watercourses on the mainland, dissect the shoal. These channels were moulded in subaerial environment during Wurm glaciation, following the tuff deposition, and then were drowned by sea-level rise. The northernmost channel, next to the pilae, likely allowed transit and manoeuvring of Roman ships. The discovery along the seabed of a large stump of lead anchor, hundreds of Roman amphorae and fragments, as well as of a depression of millstone, confirm this finding. Probably the sinuous physiography favored the choice of this site for the docking of Sinuessa, as sheltered from storms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.",2016
"Guns, farms, and foreign languages: the introduction of western learning and the first government schools in late nineteenth-century Korea",Korean history; government schools; educational reform; open port period,,"Despite the turbulent political circumstances of the 1880s, and notwithstanding opposition from key government officials, this decade witnessed the Korean government's initial attempts to establish educational institutions modelled after western schools - the Royal College (Yugyeong Gongweon), a military academy (Yeonmu Gongweon), and an agricultural experiment station (Nongmu Mokchuk Shiheomjang). These three institutions focused on the English language and general western learning, military training and agricultural technology, and were all influenced by American-style learning and employed American instructors. Rather than depict the introduction of western learning to Korea as an epic battle between orthodox learning (Confucianism) and heterodox learning (western learning) or frame it in terms of tradition and modernity, this article argues that through a conscious and complex process of selection, the adaptation of specific elements of western learning was a pragmatic and manageable move on the part of the Korean government to fulfil the immediate needs of the state. Following the lines of the Wealthy Country, Strong Army school of thought, reform intellectuals advocated a practical programme of reform to strengthen the army and build a more robust economy. By examining official documents and primary sources, the role of pragmatism can be seen to underscore the complexity of the implementation of concrete reform. Thus, oversimplified dichotomies of the modern versus traditional cannot accurately depict this period of change.",2016
Early age behavior analysis for reinforced concrete bridge pier,construction analysis; bridge pier; heat of hydration; initial concrete temperature; stripping formwork time,CONSTRUCTION; SIMULATION; STRESSES,"In this study, the construction of a reinforced concrete bridge pier was analyzed from durability point of view. The goal of the study is to analyze the crack iniation condition due to construction and present some recommendations for construction conditions of the reinforced concrete bridge pier. The bridge is located at the western port area of Shenzhen, where the climate is high temperature and humidity. To control the cracking of concrete, a construction simulation was carried out for a heat transfer problem as well as a thermal stress problem. A shrinkage model for heat produced due to cement hydration and a Burger constitutive model to simulate the creep effect are used. The modelling based on Femmasse(C) is verified by comparing with the testing results of a real underground abutment. For the bridge pier, the temperature and stress distribution, as well as their evolution with time are shown. To simulate the construction condition, four initial concrete temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C) and three demoulding time tips (48h, 72h, 96h) are investigated. From the results, it is concluded that a high initial concrete temperature could result in a high extreme internal temperature, which causes the early peak temperature and the larger principle stresses. The demoulding time seems to be less important for the chosen study cases. Currently used 72 hours in the construction practice may be a reasonable choice.",2016

Monitoring the Structural Response of the Liefkenshoek Rail Tunnel to Tidal Level Fluctuations,Shield-driven tunnel; Precast concrete segments; Tidal river; Monitoring; Strain gauges; Ovalization; Leveling measurements; Movement; River tides,,"The 6-km-long Liefkenshoek rail tunnel creates a new freight connection in the Port of Antwerp (Belgium) by crossing the River Scheldt and Port Canal. The water level variation of the river, corresponding to the tides of the North Sea, proved to be a nonnegligible load state for the tunnel lining. This paper reports how the structural response of the Liefkenshoek tunnel to the tidal fluctuations could be identified, thanks to the various components of the complementary monitoring program, consisting of strain, ovalization, and leveling measurements. First, an in-depth study on the methodology of the applied monitoring procedures is presented. Next, results show that the tidal effect causes an oscillating vertical displacement of the tunnel lining up to 10mm between low and high tide. Outside the river boundaries, no significant tidal influence is found, and the transition zone between the stable tunnel section and the moving part below the river appears to be constrained to a relatively small tunnel section. Furthermore, the concrete lining shows a uniform compression and relaxation between tides. The corresponding monitored stress changes show a good resemblance with results from simplified analytical calculation. The findings of this paper perfectly illustrate how the design process of segmental tunnel linings requires a thorough understanding of the project surroundings for a correct identification of all loads on the precast concrete elements, both during and after tunnel drive works.

Secondary aggregates and seawater employment for sustainable concrete dyke blocks production: Case study,Sustainable concrete; Recycled aggregates; Steel slags; Sea water; Concrete block; Case study; Cores; Properties,INDUSTRIAL BY-PRODUCTS; HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; RECYCLED AGGREGATE; COARSE AGGREGATE; PLAIN CONCRETE; SEA-WATER; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT; CONSTRUCTION,"The main objective of this research work was to validate the on site real scale production of dyke blocks employing coarse mixed recycled aggregates, steel slag aggregates and seawater. A laboratory experimental phase (Phase 1) was carried out prior to real scale concrete block production within Barcelona's port (Phase 2). According to the results, the concretes produced with a combined mixture of 50% coarse mixed aggregates and 50% of coarse steel aggregates achieved the most adequate properties for use in dyke block manufacturing. The concrete produced employing high percentages of coarse mixed recycled aggregates (without steel slag aggregates) could achieve adequate properties in its saturated state. The use of seawater instead of freshwater reduced the concrete's setting time as well as the porosity of the concretes produced, resulting in both the reduction of water penetration and the capillary water absorption capacity of the concretes. The use of seawater increased concrete's compressive strength at early age. It was also concluded that the results obtained in the laboratory studies and the technical know-how achieved can be transferred to large scale projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Y Recycled aggregates in structural concrete - a Qatar case study,codes of practice & standards; concrete technology & manufacture; recycling & use of materials,,"Despite established knowledge on the application of recycled aggregate in concrete, their use in structural concrete is somewhat limited. A sustainable supply of recycled materials together with adequate quality production and monitoring can enable wider use in high-value applications. Infrastructure in Qatar is being developed rapidly with large projects for the hosting of the World Cup 2022. One of the main challenges facing the construction industry is the lack of locally available good quality aggregates and the increased demand for aggregates. Industry relies on imported aggregates but there are concerns about quality and limited port capacity. Meanwhile, large quantities of construction wastes are available with potential to support the government strategy of green and sustainable construction. Recycled aggregates were subjected to extensive testing to optimise their use in structural C40 concrete and building trials were used to demonstrate how to apply this in practice. The results indicated at least similar strength and durability-related properties compared with imported aggregates. The project outcomes are being used to update the Qatar Construction Specification. A quality management system was developed to ensure a consistent supply of recycled aggregates and the project is now moving to implement recycled materials in government projects.",2016
Impact of Singapore's importers on life-cycle assessment of concrete,Life-cycle assessment (LCA); Cement; Aggregates; Concrete; Life-cycle inventory (LCI) analysis; Green Mark Scheme (GMS) for Singapore,CEMENT PRODUCTION; PORTLAND-CEMENT; INVENTORIES; MANUFACTURE; IMPROVEMENT; CHINA; EU,"Singapore consumes large volumes of concrete to sustain its growth in construction. To comply with its Green Mark Scheme, it is necessary for Singapore to take action in consuming concrete products with lower carbon footprint. This study quantifies and suggests alternatives for reducing the embodied energy and environmental impacts of cement and aggregate consumption in concrete products being utilized in Singapore. A cradle-to-gate life-cycle assessment methodology is considered to quantify the life-cycle inventory of cement and aggregates based on the current trading volumes of these concrete materials imported to Singapore. The cradle-to-gate system boundary includes raw materials extraction, production processes, and transportation of raw materials to production facilities as well as transportation of end-products (cement and aggregates) from the production facility in the importing country to the Port of Singapore. Geographical system boundary covers the neighboring countries that export cement and aggregates to Singapore. Life-cycle inventory results include an inventory of environmental exchanges (energy as input and major air emissions as output) for the functional unit within the defined product system. In this study, results are first demonstrated as per unit weight of cement and aggregate imported to Singapore. Following the calculation of life-cycle inventory results per unit weight of cement and aggregates, embodied energy and global warming potential of a concrete mix normalized with respect to strength are compared for two scenarios. The first scenario represents the Singapore's current trading volumes while the second one is based on cement and aggregate imports from Malaysia which due to its close proximity to Singapore and efficient production technologies and greener fuel mixes results in a reduction in both global and regional impacts compared to the Singapore's current trading conditions. By importing cement and aggregates from Malaysia instead of the current trading conditions global warming potential and embodied energy of a high-strength concrete mix can be reduced by 11% and 31%, respectively.

Safety Evaluation of a Long-Span Steel Trestle with an Extended Service Term Age in a Coastal Port Based on Identification of Modal Parameters,modal testing; steel truss structure; trestle; oil wharf; safety assessment,DAMAGE DETECTION; BRIDGE,"Combining vibration testing and safety evaluation improves the understanding of structural vibration behavior, aids in the future design of similar structures, and provides key information for the design of remedial measures. This paper investigates the safety of a unique full-scale 40 year old steel trestle structure of an oil wharf based on the identification of modal parameters. This structure is a typical simply -supported through -type parabolic vierendeel steel truss (SSTTPVST) structure with a span of 106m in an extended service term age. Steel trestle vibration responses were measured using state-of-the-art methods, such as ambient vibration survey, initial velocity excitation method, and initial displacement excitation method. The natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios of the trestles located in land and in the sea were obtained in both the vertical and horizontal lateral directions. Test results showed that the vibration parameters identified by the three excitation methods were almost identical despite the differences in excitation levels between methods. It was also demonstrated that properly planned testing can be performed successfully even in limited conditions, such as low-level excitation. In addition, finite element (FE) modeling of this trestle and model consistency with both experimental results of natural frequencies and mode shapes were described. A mode shape node was found in the first vertical mode shape of this kind of trestle, which was proven in the time history and Fourier spectrum of the trestle vibration response. This result was considerably different than that of normal simply -supported concrete bridges on highways. The safety evaluation of the trestles located in land and in the sea was carried out using the natural frequency changes based on the frequencies obtained in three different years, including the years 2000, 2002, and 2014. The evaluation results indicated that the damage of the trestle located in the sea was more severe than that of the trestle in land, which paralleled with the visual inspection result of the trestle.",2016

Design/methodology/approach - A qualitative methodology that incorporates questionnaires and interview sessions as the tools is utilised together with an application of new innovation concept. Findings - The proposed system not only allows increased efficiency and effectiveness in handling containers, but also increases the profit margin of ports, as container stacking/storage is tripled in height. Research limitations/implications - This is just the beginning of a preliminary research study that proposes a new container stacking/storage system to address the lack of space in container yards. Therefore, much more work needs to be done in future studies before a solid and concrete decision on the application of this innovative system can be carried out. Practical implications - The practicality of the proposed model means that it can be easily implemented to address space limitation problems in ports. Social implications - The benefits of the results to the local community around ports are a healthier environment, with cleaner air, so that there will be less health issues of the residents and therefore reduced burden on the local health system. This is due to the use of technology that will prevent the expansion of ports that ultimately could lead to deforestation and environmental damage. This technology will also help to preserve the greenery of the area around ports.

Paulsboro Marine Terminal Wharf Design and Construction,,,"The construction of the wharf at the Paulsboro Marine Terminal, in Paulsboro, NJ, began in the winter of 2014. There have been many obstacles to overcome before the first pile could be driven into the Delaware River. This paper discusses the planning, design, and construction of the wharf. The cast-in-place concrete deck is supported by precast concrete planks and cast-in-place concrete caps that are built atop precast concrete piles. Full build out of the wharf will include three deep water ship berths and a barge berth. The live load capacity of the deck is 1,500 pounds per square foot with specific heavy lift areas capable of supporting higher loads. A freight rail and gantry crane are also planned to be located on the wharf. A separate rail access trestle and a combination sheet pile wall was required to protect environmentally sensitive areas around the project site. The South Jersey Port Corporation (SJPC) - an agency of the State of New Jersey - in conjunction with the Gloucester County Improvement Authority (GCIA) and the Borough of Paulsboro is in the process of redeveloping the former British Petroleum (BP) Oil Terminal and the adjacent former Essex Industrial Chemicals, Inc. (Essex) properties into a new, deep-water marine terminal with associated processing, distribution, assembly and intermodal operations that will be called the Paulsboro Marine Terminal. Upon completion, the Terminal will cover 200 acres of land and include a deep-water wharf on the waterside of the property. The landside improvements include a new bridge and roadways providing direct interstate access, rail and utility infrastructure along with other associated civil improvements to control site drainage. Full build out of the wharf will include three deep water ship berths along the Delaware River and one barge berth along the upriver side of the wharf, which turns to run parallel the adjacent Mantua Creek. The total length of new waterside berth space will be over 2,500 feet. Supported on over 2,300 precast concrete piles the wharf was designed to carry a uniform live load of 1,500 pounds per square foot and load combinations from a variety of cranes and other cargo handling equipment. A special design was incorporated for two heavy loading areas extending the length of the wharf to account for the propping loads of a 200-ton mobile harbor crane. The design also accounted for the future inclusion of a gantry crane with a gage between the rails of 100 feet. A train rail track is also included on the wharf to allow direct loading of project cargo to rail. The train rail track was designed to carry a live loading equivalent to the Cooper E-100. Due to permitting requirements, it was necessary to construct the wharf as a pile supported deck over open water approximately 150 feet from the original shoreline. Therefore, standalone trestles are required to provide rail and vehicle access to the wharf. The rail trestle carries a curved portion of the rail and is supported on independent pile bents connected together using precast concrete bulb-tee beams. The wharf is supported on twenty-four (24) inch square prestressed concrete pilings that rely on both end bearing and skin friction to resist a maximum ultimate load of 1,800 kips. Pile bents were spaced at approximately fifteen (15) feet and support precast deck planks with a cast-in-place topping slab. The wharf was designed to handle 68,000 DWT vessels with a draft of forty-five ( 45) feet, which will be the maximum draft in the Delaware River once the deepening is completed in 2017. Bollards consisted of 200 ton double-bit bollards spaced at approximately sixty feet. Rubber cone fenders with prefabricated steel fender panels and UHMW facing spaced at approximately thirty feet were designed to protect the wharf during berthing.",2016
"Challenges during the Design and Construction of the New Wharf and Double Sheetpile Wall Breakwater at Puerto San Antonio, Chile",,,"Puerto Central (PCE) was awarded in 2011 a new concession at Puerto San Antonio, the main port of Chile. In 2013 they started a major renovation project as part of the concession agreement, the largest port infrastructure investment under construction in the country. The new terminal will be capable of receiving 366 m LOA post Panamax vessels and move 1.2M TEU per year. It will also transfer sulfuric acid, clinker, ro-ro, and bulk cargo. The main structures on the project are a 700 m long vertical pile wharf and a double sheetpile wall breakwater. The wharf considers a precast concrete system that works as formwork and shapes beams and slabs, allowing faster and simpler construction than traditional piling wharves. The breakwater is 50 m long and 15 m wide, it is exposed to large wave action and strong seismic loads. There are not many documented examples of structures like this, making it ideal for a case study. A description of the most relevant design and construction challenges for these structures is presented.",2016
Existing Pile Foundation Evaluation for a Pier Upgrade,,,"The Pier 3 Upgrade project at the Port of Tacoma was completed in anticipation of super-post-Panamax size container ships. The primary goals of the project were to maintain the existing 64-foot-gauge crane rail and to accommodate a new 100-foot-gauge crane rail for new higher capacity container cranes. The upgrade includes adding piles to the outboard crane rail and upgrading the existing wharf to support both existing container cranes and new, larger container cranes. The new crane rail is supported on a combination of the original concrete piles installed in the 1980s and new concrete piles installed as part of this upgrade project. The project geotechnical engineers evaluated the as-installed resistances of existing piles using data from the initial construction. By evaluating each existing pile individually, the design team justified increasing the allowable axial resistance of select individual existing piles. This limited the number of new piles required for the upgrade and reduced the over-all project cost.",2016
Port of Neah Bay Commercial Dock Replacement,,,"The Makah Tribe has fished in and around Neah Bay, Washington, for over 4,000 years. In early 2013, the Tribe recognized that deterioration of their aging timber fishing dock posed a large threat to the economy of this remote community at the northwestern-most point of the state and continental United States and selected a design team to replace the facility using the traditional design/bid/build method of procurement. In August 2013 during conceptual design, a portion of the decking collapsed, and the dock was closed because of the resulting unsafe conditions. As a result of a concentrated team effort by the Makah Tribe and their consultant team, all federal, state, and local permits for the work were obtained within 88 days of application submittal, and in-water construction began in late December 2013, four months after the collapse. By pre-ordering the piles and using a precast concrete deck system to minimize cast-in-place concrete, the dock structure was completed in three months and the facility, consisting of an access trestle, dock, fish-buying station, storage warehouse, and ice production plant, was operational by October 2014. This paper will provide an overview of the project and describe the challenges and solutions developed by the team that allowed the project to be completed only 10 months after the collapse.",2016
Strengthening an Aging Marginal Wharf for RO/RO Operations,,,"In response to an increase in demand for heavy-lift RO/RO operations at the Port of Everett, a portion of an aging 1970s vintage concrete marginal wharf was strengthened and repaired to increase the load-carrying capacity from 550 psf live load to 1,000 psf. The improvements included adding new piles and intermediate pile caps between the existing pile caps, and strengthening the existing pile caps. The existing pile caps within the upgrade area were also repaired to correct corrosion damage caused by chloride-ion intrusion. The repairs included removal of deteriorated concrete, cleaning and replacement of the corroded reinforcing steel, and replacement of the concrete. Cast-in zinc anodes were used to provide cathodic protection. Underwater and underdeck (above water) inspections by the engineers designing the improvements quantified the severity and extent of the structural deterioration. This enabled selection of the best possible repair methods to reduce project costs and increase the structures' service life and strength. This paper describes the investigation of alternatives, analysis and design of the upgrades and repairs, and the challenges of construction.",2016
"Modular and Moveable Petroleum Loading Docks Phillips 66-Freeport Terminal Projects in Freeport, Texas",,,"The Phillips 66 marine terminal, located in Freeport, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico, is a deep-water berthing facility used for importing and exporting petroleum products. Three docks are being upgraded at the site. The improvements will allow the addition of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and pentane plus (C5+) operations. To accommodate long-term port planning, two of the structures will eventually be relocated to increase the size of the Old Brazos River Channel. Originally planned for rehabilitation and expansion, the docks were redesigned midway through the process as new modularly constructed structures. In addition, two of the docks will incorporate the ability to be moved, as a whole, to a future location. The modular construction will allow the current docks to remain in service as the new dock platforms are being constructed. This will minimize the downtime of the facility during the upgrade. The modular pieces will be assembled on-site and placed with the loading arms, gangway tower, crane, control cabin, and additional piping assemblies and utilities already installed on the modular pieces. The facility, located in ""Hurricane Alley,"" will be subjected to significant wind and wave loads. Deflection control of the docks and product piping support structures is vital to avoid loss of product and to eliminate the use of multiple expansion joints and product piping loops. To obtain the required strength and stiffness, a combination of steel moment frames and braced frames are utilized in the design of the dock platform, pipe way and access way structures. Various aspects of the project are examined, including the steel and concrete modular platform design, modular section to steel pipe pile connection design, access way and product pipe way design, and future removal and reinstallation of two docks. Due to innovative solutions and creative engineering, the project team was able to deliver a product that meets the Client's future needs within the restricted site layout configuration, with minimal production downtime, and provides an elegant design for the current facility.",2016
Consecutive Earthquakes Evaluation of Berths 100-102 at the Port of Los Angeles,,,"POLA Berths 100-102, consisting of 2,500 foot-long (762 m) concrete container wharves, were constructed in three phases over a 10-year period. This paper discusses the seismic analysis and evaluation of post-seismic conditions for these wharf structures, which included three levels of ground motion with corresponding performance criteria, and identified vulnerabilities based on the expected structural response for a typical wharf section. Single and multiple consecutive discrete earthquake events were analyzed. No established methods exist to determine displacement demand due to consecutive discrete earthquake events, defined as an event that occurs after the first event allowing sufficient time for the structure to unload and reach a rest position. In this paper, two methods were proposed to determine these displacement demands, the Algebraic Addition and Residual Methods, were analyzed. Additionally, repair methods were proposed and analyzed for single and consecutive post-seismic events to verify/confirm the performance of the proposed repair method.",2016
A Risk-Based Structural Assessment Approach for Port Metro Vancouver's Asset Management,,,"This paper presents a risk-based structural assessment methodology used in conjunction with a life cycle cost analysis to assist Port Metro Vancouver develop a multi-year works program with funding needs for maintaining the reliability of its assets. The risk measure is based on the probability of structural failure and the monetary consequence of failure, and accounts for the deterioration of material over time. For steel, the corrosion rate was used as the measure of deterioration. For reinforced concrete, material modelling estimated the rate of degradation, the onset and the progression of rebar corrosion over time. The failure probabilities were estimated first by assuming that no repair or rehabilitation is performed. Then various scenarios of preventative risk mitigation measures were considered, and their associated costs were used in the life cycle cost analysis to develop strategies for asset management. An example of the completed projects, the merits, and the limitations of this approach are presented.",2016
Berths 196-199 Wharf Rehabilitation at the Port of Los Angeles,,,"Berths 196-199 at the Port of Los Angeles (POLA) are utilized as an auto terminal with an extensive railyard for loading/unloading of auto racks. Due to existing conditions and structure age, rehabilitation is required. Rehabilitation consists of approximately 60 timber piles and 1,600 joists undergoing repair, in-kind replacement, or upgrade; concrete wharf repairs to replace approximately 120,230 sf of asphalt concrete; restoring load carrying capacity to 500 psf (axial pile capacity is the limiting factor); and upgrading vehicle load from small truck to standard class highway loading (HS-20). In addition, an under-wharf inspection found all utility pipes (except waterlines) under deck are no longer in use and contaminated with hazardous materials, and the potable water lines are in need of replacement.

"New Floating Cruise Ship Berths for Juneau, Alaska",,,"The City and Borough of Juneau (CBJ) needed additional berthing space downtown for the larger cruise ships arriving to the Inside Passage of Alaska. Floating cruise ship berths were selected by the project team as the preferred alternative in order to accommodate passenger loading, unloading, and queueing operations and to provide greater security, address the large tides, and unique geotechnical challenges presented by the project site. PND worked closely with officials from the CBJ and the cruise line agencies during the planning and design phases of the project to provide input on the size, alignment, and features of the new floating berths. The final configuration of the floating cruise ship berths are parallel and offshore from the current downtown cruise ship fixed docks. The new berths included two large floating concrete pontoons. The largest pontoon measures 400 feet long and 50 feet wide. The second pontoon measures 300 feet long and 50 feet wide. The concrete pontoons are held in place by large, steel pipe pile dolphins. In addition to the concrete pontoons, other major project elements include mooring and breasting dolphins to support ship berthing operations, two orthotropic steel transfer bridges, two timber approach piers, a smaller moorage float with gangway access, electrical systems to support the facility operations, and water and waste water systems to support ship operations while in port. The project site for the downtown cruise ship berths presents many challenges that are unique to marine infrastructure design in southeast Alaska. These challenges include geotechnical conditions which vary from loose marine sediment to shallow, steep, sloping bedrock, large tidal ranges, and extreme environmental conditions. By utilizing the experience of designing and constructing in similar conditions in Alaska and elsewhere, the project team was able to address these challenges with the new berths' design.",2016
Deltaport Berth 3's Design and Construction Challenges,,,"Port Metro Vancouver, located in the southwestern corner of British Columbia, is Canada's largest port. Deltaport Container Terminal, at Roberts Bank just south of Vancouver, opened for business in 1997 and was an immediate success. In response to increased demand and growth forecasts Port Metro Vancouver, in partnership with the terminal operator (Global Container Terminals), decided to extend the two-berth caisson wharf and expand the container terminal to increase annual throughput by 50% from 1.2 to 1.8 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). This paper will focus on some of the unique aspects of the design for the Deltaport Berth 3 expansion, and resolution of key challenges encountered during construction. Concrete caissons for the wharf extension were prefabricated off-site, towed to site, and then installed at super-elevated positions to compensate for anticipated differential settlements and rotations due to the added mass of the terminal reclamation fills. This elevation pre-set provided a precisely aligned wharf extension, smooth alignment of crane rails and a level apron pavement. A risk based approach was used to develop appropriate seismic design criteria for the main wharf and for the ship-to-shore crane rails. Displacement-based seismic criteria were used for the design of this concrete gravity caisson wharf. Marine vibro-densification of the crushed rock foundation fills, combined with vibro-replacement and dynamic compaction of apron backfill materials, were methods used to improve the bearing capacity, seismic resistance, and settlement performance. A fill management plan was implemented for placement and preloading of reclamation fills in the terminal area, optimized to use all preload material as backfill. Wave protection for the Deltaport tugboat facility was provided by a tied sheet-piled bulkhead, as a temporary measure during berth construction. The design philosophy for the north end closure wall for the wharf extension, was based on the consequences of overall wall integrity and rupture of individual elements. Significant difficulties were overcome during construction of these sheet-piled walls.",2016
"Utilizing Colloidal Nano-Silica as Treatment for Concrete in Salt Water Ports: Laboratory Chloride Diffusion, Life Cycle Modeling, and the Port of Marseille Test Case",,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CEMENT HYDRATION; FLY-ASH; NANOSILICA,"Colloidal nano-silica treatment for concrete was initially developed in the oil and gas industry to reduce the permeability of undersea well caps in the 1970s, acting as a capillary and pore-filling agent to reduce oil loss into seawater. Portland cement concrete with a high chloride diffusion rate leads to premature corrosion of reinforcing steel. Recently, colloidal nano-silica has been shown to reduce the chloride diffusion rate in conventional concrete and to reduce drying shrinkage. Laboratory testing utilizing chloride ponding and non-steady state chloride migration confirm previous work. Lifecycle corrosion modeling demonstrates the utility of colloidal nano-silica for extending the expected lifespan of concrete in saltwater ports. In addition, a test case is presented at The Port of Marseille, France, where a 70 m long boat dock was placed in 2014 with the goal of testing low shrinkage, less permeable concrete treated with colloidal nano-silica as a preamble to renovation of the 6 km sea wall that protects the harbor.",2016
Alternative Asphalt Concrete Pavement Design Methods at the Port of Los Angeles,,,"This paper will discuss the empirical results of incorporating composite paving interlayers within pavement sections of streets located on Terminal Island at the Port of Los Angeles. Historically, this area is subject to extensive pavement distress caused by high volumes of terminal truck traffic. In an effort to minimize impacts to operating terminal traffic, the Port of Los Angeles developed the use of experimental pavement sections to reduce the construction time, traffic control set up, and cost of the street repair work while still maintaining the structural integrity of the roadway. The objective of the experimental pavement overlay projects was to provide an effective and sustainable alternative to traditional full-depth street reconstruction with the incorporation of geocomposite materials. The primary focus of this paper will be on a lightweight polypropylene paving fabric reinforced with continuous filament fiberglass versus a paving mat interlayer and the benefits of each in regards to tensile strength, crack-resilience, moisture protection, and overall life span of the pavement.",2016
Modern techniques and concrete technology used to conserve a unique heritage breakwater,,,"The channel island of Jersey has one major commercial port which is not only vital for the island's daily supplies but also the main port of entry for tourist trade. St Helier Harbour is protected from the south-westerly prevailing wind and waves by Hermitage Breakwater, construction of which was started in 1874. The ravages of time appeared to have not unduly damaged the structure but recently the Island's engineers had been monitoring the breakwater and became concerned over its deteriorating condition. The damage to the surface protection of the precast blocks and joints on this south-west facing section of the wall of the pre-1887 construction was seen to have significantly deteriorated after the early 2014 storms. Using petrography from concrete core samples it was found that at depth in the section some of the cement had not hydrated which meant that the blocks, once they had sustained surface damage had a residual capacity, when coming in to contact with sea water as the outer concrete was worn away and therefore had self-annealing properties.",2016
Non-Linear Analysis of 3D Interaction of Soil - Diaphragm wall Structure with Different Cross-Sections,Different stiffness; varying anchor locations; static load; displacement; bending moment,,"Diaphragm walls have been used throughout the world to construct deep underground structures, conventionally by using the Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC).Stiffer walls attracts larger bending moment than flexible walls (Potts & Day, 1991). Research has shown that increase in wall flexibility increases displacement, hence reduction in bending moment. In this paper static analysis of diaphragm wall sections having different stiffness are carried out using PLAXIS 3D software for the load condition existing in deep draft berth of New Mangalore Port, India. The displacement and bending moment are found out for diaphragm wall sections and results are compared with the actual diaphragm wall section having 1.1m thick. For analysis, a single panel diaphragm wall section having 5m length with 2.5m center to center spaced anchors is modelled. Soil properties are considered as per the boreholes data's obtained from New Mangalore Port. The results are validated with values derived from the design chart.",2016

The rheological behaviour depends on the soil (solid) type, the volume concentration, the salinity and the testing methods. In this study, rheological investigations of marine sediments from the Port of Koper were carried out by using two coaxial cylinder rheometers (DV3T HB, Brookfield and ConTec Viscometer 5). The influence of the specimen volume, the size of the gap and the type of measuring spindles were analysed and compared. The measured data were evaluated using the Bingham model. For each data set, the boundary between the sheared (""fluid"") and the un-sheared (""solid"") material was calculated and then the calculated boundary was used instead of the outer radius of the cylinder for the evaluation of the rheological parameters, where necessary. A good comparison of the results was found when using this approach. The results are also in agreement with the literature data. The ConTec Viscometer 5, primarily designed for mortars and concrete, was shown to be also suitable for the investigation of sediments.",2016

Accelerated corrosion tests have provided very useful information on corrosion propagation and residual life stages, but tests and data from natural corrosionare required to validate and corroborate previous findings. Concrete cylinders cured for one day, with different water/cement (w/c) ratios, exposed at three natural sites, 50 m, 100 m and 780 m from the seashore (three micro-climates) in the Port of Progreso, Yucatan, Mexico, were used to measure corrosion parameters such as time-to corrosion initiation, apparent corrosion rate, surface crack propagation, rebar radius loss to generate concrete cover cracking, and rebar pit depth due to natural corrosion. A slight but clear correlation between data of concrete cracking from the three micro-climates was found. The w/c ratio of concrete was the most important parameter in the durability performance of concrete insuch tropical environment. Empirical correlations between natural and accelerated corrosion tests were also obtained to corroborate data available in the literature regarding residual life of corroding reinforced concrete structures.",2016
CARBONATION-RESISTANT EVALUATION OF THE FLY-ASH CONCRETE IN CONSIDERATION OF THE POZZOLANIC REACTION,Carbonation; Fly ash; Pozzolanic reaction; Accelerated test,,"There are opinions that concretes which used fly-ash for as mixture materials are superior in durability compared with port-land cement plain concrete by characteristics such as the formation of elaborate structure and long-term strength development by the pozzolanic reaction. In contrast, when executes durable evaluations of fly-ash concretes by accelerated tests, there is particularly difficult to evaluate potential ability in carbonation resistance appropriately, because it is exposed to extremely severe from true environment before the progress of the pozzolanic reaction. We thought that it was necessary to activate the pozzolanic reaction before accelerated carbonation tests so that the formation of elaborate structure by pozzolanic reaction if targeted the tests. Firstly, sealed the specimen side of test pieces, and took treatment of them in environment temperature 40 degrees Celsius. Thereafter, examined accelerated carbonation tests, compressive strength tests, and quantitative analysis of the Calcium hydroxide by the differential thermal analysis method. As a result, it was revealed that the progress of the pozzolanic reaction depends on the temperature from compressive strength tests and quantitative analysis of the Calcium hydroxide, and incorporated the formation of elaborate structure by the pozzolanic reaction in the carbonation resistant, it became clear that approximately 20% evaluation level improved on the average. From this, it was not only expansion of the utilization of the industrial by-product to use fly-ash concrete, and the possibility that an aspect the improvement durability of the concrete could contribute to sustainability was suggested.",2016

Crosshole Radar for Underground Structure Defect Detection: System Design and Model Experiment,underground structure; defect; crosshole radar; antenna design; model experiment,BOREHOLE RADAR; TOMOGRAPHY; SCHEME,"This paper presents a crosshole radar system and its model experiment for underground structure's defect detection. The system was built using a vector nebvork analyzer (VNA), cylinder dipole antennas, and a radio frequency (RF) amplifier. The VNA enables the radar to work in a stepped frequency mode. The antenna, which has a carefully designed diameter of 32 mm, is compatible with most boreholes in common underground structures and is tested to work in the frequency range from 210 MHz to 560 MHz. The RF amplifier, set up at the output port of the VNA, amplifies radar signals by approximated 20 dB in the working frequency band. This system is tested by a reinforced concrete underground structure (diaphragm wall) model experiment, in which embedded defects are detected by the crosshole radar through two adjacent preset boreholes. MOG data were recorded and processed by a first arrival travel time tomography method. The defective areas were reconstructed correctly from the inversion result, which validates the capability of the crosshole radar system and this method for underground structure defect detection.",2016

Issues of seafarers' working time are very topical because in recent years the load of navigation officers has significantly increased, either due to increase in shipping intensity, or in the context of the new international maritime law, for example, compliance with the requirements of the ISM CODE (International Management safety Code), THE ISPS (The International Ship and Port Facility Security Code). Irregularities are observed in practice of the seafarers' working hours and rest hours, and even the mismatch, as presented in the port of inspection materials. This article is intended to assess the 2nd and 3rd Officer's load compliance with the regulatory enactments for the work and rest regime to develop proposals to load optimization. Load analysis of Navigation officers is based on international maritime regulations that determine the work and rest regime on ships STCW (The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers), MLC (Maritime Labour Convention). In the article, concrete data is used from the research, which was conducted 18 months on the Handy type of tanker from July, 2012 till December, 2013 in the real time mode. In the article is also concrete data used from 340 survey respondents, which reflects the views of the navigation officers on violations of the work and rest regime on the ship and the fatigue issue.",2016
PIANC Guidelines: Oil and Petrochemical Terminal Design,,,"This new PIANC reference will provide a set of recommendations to the global community involved in the initial design, analysis, or rehabilitation of marine oil and petroleum terminals. Potential users include owners/operators, port authorities, consulting engineers and others. It will also provide guidance for post-event inspection/rehabilitation and triggers for the reassessment of an existing terminal. This paper is an update to one presented at Ports 2013 (Heffron et al. 2013) and provides a resolution of some key issues. This project has involved major oil companies, terminal operators, consultants and vendors and is scheduled to be published in 2016. This paper will focus on three major issues that have been resolved: 1. Design loads and applicable codes 2. Loads transferred to mooring dolphins from multiple quick release hooks 3. Geotechnical recommendations for each phase of the design For the design loads and codes, there are two primary options. The first is an American approach, involving the MOTEMS (2011), and conventional steel and concrete codes. And if the structures are steel tubular jacket type structures, API RP 2A would be applicable. The second approach is European, using the British Standards (BS 6349, 2016) and applicable Eurocodes. Other options presented include the English translation of Japanese standards, and references to the Spanish ROM and Russian codes. Each of these choices mandates specific loading combinations and design factors. The second issue involves the determination of the appropriate design load for the anchorage and design of mooring dolphins, with multiple quick release hooks. A simple equation has been agreed upon, based on the safe working load (SWL) of the hooks. This maximum calculated load is then compared to the maximum factored mooring load, and the larger of the two is used for the design of the dolphin. The third issue is what are the necessary geotechnical investigations and reports recomThe mended for each phase of the design, from pre-FEED, FEED and final design. A table of recommended actions and studies is provided, and gives guidance to both the engineer and the client, to ensure that the resulting design in based on sound geotechnical tests and studies.",2016
Port Canaveral Cruise Terminal 1Berth,,,"The Canaveral Port Authority has constructed Cruise Terminal 1 to accommodate the demand for home port and port-of-call berths for the largest cruise ships. The $100 million project included a 17,460 m(2) ( 188,000 sg ft) terminal building, a 1,022 car parking garage, two mobile passenger gangways, a 445 m ( 1,461 feet) long deep wall wharf, dredging with reuse of suitable spoil material, and scour protection mats. The berth is designed to accommodate the constantly increasing size of ultra-large cruise vessels. This paper will focus on the design and construction of the berth to accommodate the operations and loadings from Oasis of the Seas and other vessels. The selection and design of the berth's wharf and marine structures will be explained including the design of the deep bulkhead walls in poor soils, the use of battered piles and articulated rods for the tie-back anchor system, and the use of 12 upland mooring dolphins for a 200 MT service load. Passing ship hydrodynamic modeling and dynamic mooring analyses were also performed to assess surge effects on berthed cruise vessel operations. It will also describe the berth's scour protection, the development of the design criteria using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of propeller wash from Oasis of the Seas' bow thrusters and stern azipods, and how the resulting bottom velocities were utilized to develop a scour protection system consisting of geotextile, concrete articulating block mats, riprap and selective concrete injection. And finally, this paper will describe some of the challenges faced during the construction of the berth that was performed under an extremely tight ten month construction schedule on a site that was shared with the simultaneous construction of the terminal building and other upland facilities.",2016
Design and Construction of Two Concrete Pontoons to Serve as Berths at the Port of Juneau Cruise Ship Terminal,,,"Two concrete pontoons were designed and constructed to serve as the new berths at the Port of Juneau Cruise Ship Terminal in Alaska.

Port of New Orleans: Mississippi River Intermodal Terminal,,,"The Mississippi River Intermodal Terminal at the Port of New Orleans ( Port) is a new on-dock intermodal railyard providing the Port's Napoleon Avenue Container Terminal with access to the six Class I railroad yards located in New Orleans. This facility, opened in March 2016, replaced an older railyard that previously provided rail connectivity for the Port's container terminal. The new intermodal terminal provides 10,000 linear feet of rail track along with five acres of heavy duty concrete paving for container marshaling. Two electric rubber tire gantry cranes with 60-ton twin pick capability transfer the containers to and from the rail cars. The railyard is capable of handling 160,000 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) per year with one track turnover per day. Not only does this project provide the Port with a more efficient intermodal railyard, but because the new yard is shifted away from the waterfront, valuable container marshaling space is freed up. This optimization paves the way for the planned expansion of the Napoleon Avenue Container Terminal.",2016
"Submerged Pile Removal in a Dredge Borrow Area, Port of Long Beach West Basin Site",,,"The United States Government executed a Lease in Furtherance of Conveyance to the City of Long Beach in 1998, allowing the City's Harbor Department (Port) to transform the former Long Beach Naval Complex (LBNC) into a modern container terminal. A substantial portion of the program included demolition of significant waterfront structures built by the Navy for shipyard use in the West Basin of the Port of Long Beach. This paper will focus on a surprise that was discovered as the Port planned to use the West Basin as a dredge borrow site to complete in-water fills for its Middle Harbor Terminal Redevelopment Program. The West Basin site included numerous piers, the majority of which were demolished by the Port during the development of the Pier T Container Terminal. While performing pre-design surveys for upcoming dredging, divers noted pilings sticking above the seafloor. Upon review, it was determined that the pilings were in an area that was not occupied by a pier demolished by the Port. Historical photographs revealed that the pier was demolished by the Navy in the early 1980s. Subsequent field investigations revealed that either timber, steel, or concrete pile remnants remained in five former pier footprints within the proposed dredge footprint. This paper will discuss the techniques used to identify the types and estimate the quantities of remaining piles, the methodologies used to estimate the costs to perform the highly challenging task of removing piling with limiting permit restrictions that precluded the use of jetting or other methods that could generate excessive turbidity in the water column, and develop bid items for a work element that had the potential to be highly variable in a public bid process.",2016
Demolition of a Deep Sea Quay Wall in Rotterdam,,,"The rapid development in containership dimensions creates a huge challenge for ports. But for one port basin in Rotterdam this challenge was too big. The nautical restrictions for the Amazonehaven would start at such moderate conditions that the basin would be closed for Ultra Large Container Ships (ULCS) about a 100 days a year. As this basin contains more than 60 percent of the deep sea quay length at ECT Delta Terminal, Europe's largest container terminal, the Port of Rotterdam Authority decided to widen the basin by demolishing the opposite bulk quay wall. In this way vessels up to 18,000 TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) have access up to 6 Beaufort wind speed. This quay wall, with a length of 950 m and a retaining height of 32 m, was constructed between 1988 and 1990 with an inclined steel combi-wall, concrete pre stressed bearing piles, MV piles (steel tension piles Muller Verfahren system) and a massive concrete superstructure. It is the first ever demolished quay wall on this scale in Rotterdam and, as far as the authors know, even globally. Before the demolition could start, a new quay wall, with al length of 2500 m was constructed and over 3 million cubic meters of sand had to be removed. All works are executed without interrupting the process at the ECT terminal. The paper describes the necessity of the widening project and focusses on the demolishing process and especially the lessons learned from this project. Most important items are unexpected heavy pile damage probably due to heavy pile driving during construction and the drill and blast operation in an operational port basin.",2016

Design of a north pole Neutron Time-of-Flight (NTOF) system at NIF,,,"A north pole NTOF system for neutron spectroscopy is being implemented at the NIF. The design is centered around a fast scintillator with low mass housing fielded 21.6m from target chamber center at theta = 18 degrees, phi = 304 degrees. The line-of-sight (LOS) features a primary port collimator, two secondary collimators in the intervening concrete floors, and a beam dump with a backscatter shield. Because the detector is being fielded on the roof of the NIF building, diagnostic options such as optical and electrical attenuation are remotely controlled, saving setup time and increasing shot rate. The expected performance of the diagnostic is excellent with high sensitivity to both high-energy reaction-in-flight neutrons as well as lower energy down-scattered neutrons.",2016
Lome Container Terminal,Quay wall; Container Terminal; Diaphragm wall; Jet Grouting; Pile,,"The aim of this paper is to describe the main design and execution criteria regarding the quay wall solution adopted which is being constructed at a length of approximately 1000 meters in the new container terminal at the Lome Port, Togo. These structures include a 29-meter deep reinforced concrete diaphragm wall, connected to an anchored dead man wall through a 45-meter long steel tie rod system. The quay cranes will run over the diaphragm wall on the sea side on a beam, founded on bored piles on the land side. Several constraints were taken into consideration, for example, the geological-geotechnical conditions as well as the high loads (due to the bollards and the crane rails), the durability, the safety and the costs. As a result of a soft clay layer, located next to the diaphragm wall tip, the ground at the wall tip level was improved in several sections with jet grout columns to prevent punching and increase the overall stability. The soil in the passive zone of the diaphragm wall was also improved with jet grouting columns to reduce the deformation and the bending moments in the quay wall.",2016
A study on Waterproof Case of Schmidt Hammer for Measurement of Underwater Concrete Structures,Schmidt hammer; Waterproof,,"The majority of port facilities are decreasing in durability such as corrosion due to salt damage of concrete structures. Therefore, the importance of compressive strength management and diagnostic technology of underwater structures is increasing day by day. While the development of high-precision test equipment on land has been quite established, on the other hand the test equipment for underwater usage are still limited. For example, there has video footage and thickness measuring gauge. Rebound hardness measurement methods using Schmidt hammer case for nondestructive inspection of land concrete structures are mostly utilized. Using the test equipment on land and in underwater, could be an advantage for its convenience. For that reason, we evaluate a waterproof case of commercial Schmidt hammer, by comparing its performance on land and on in underwater test. From this study, we produced a waterproof case to be used for the commercial Schmidt hammer in underwater. Further we suggest an empirical equation as a comparison results between common Schmidt hammer and waterproofed system.",2016
"Trust, but verify: why and how to establish trust in embedded devices (Invited Paper)",,,"A lot of research efforts have been put into constructing secure systems. However, experience has shown that, while there are many products which have a good level of security, others are really insecure. Some are security devices: security is at the core of their purpose; while other are not. We nevertheless often rely on the their security in our daily life and their failure can have serious consequences. In this paper, we discuss why we are in this situation and what we can do to improve the situation. In particular, we defend the thesis that more transparency and more openness in embedded systems hardware and software will foster a more secure ecosystem. First, there is an economic problem. Besides being a difficult problem to solve correctly, security is most of the times an expensive. Second, trust is something that is not blindly granted but that is earned by verifying it. Currently, trusted computing mechanisms often rely on unconditional trust on the systems manufacturer. However, users have too few ways to verify that the systems are trustworthy other than blindly trust the manufacturer. We should design systems where the users, i.e., the devices owners, can decide whom and what to trust. We call this Design For User Trust, where users are in control of the system. Finally, one can only trust a system fully if he can inspect it. Unfortunately, the first security measures that are implemented in embedded systems often prevent such an independent analysis (e.g., deactivation of a debug port, secure boot, encrypted file system, obfuscation). But such measures are more hiding the problems (making it difficult to discover software vulnerabilities) than solving it. They are often useful in securing a system (slowing down an attacker) but should not jeopardize our ability to analyze them. We call this Design For Security Testing. We conclude that more research is needed to make it easier to build secure systems, in particular, in the areas of concrete architectures for Design For User Trust and Design For Security Testing.",2016
Cement Mortar with Nanosilica: Experiments with Mixture Design Method,ANOVA; cement mortar; mechanical properties; mixture design method; nanosilica,SILICA FUME; FLY-ASH; NANO-SIO2 PARTICLES; NANO-PARTICLES; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; OPTIMIZATION,"The statistical mixture design (SAID) method was used to find the optimum blending proportions of cement mortar by blending port land cement with silica fume and nanosilica particles. Test results from 13 experimental runs with different combinations of materials were tested and analyzed to reach an optimum mixture proportion subject to several performance characteristics at a minimum cost. Response trace plots and contour plots were used for examining the mixture components on the response variables that included compressive strengths at 3, 7, and 28 days; splitting strength; flexural strength; water absorption; and capillary permeability coefficient. The desirability function approach was used to calculate desired optimum blend of cement mortar at a minimum cost. In mixture optimization, the SAID method is a useful tool to obtain a scientific solution instead of trial-and-error method with cost-effective mixture proportions.",2016
A first approach to earthquake damage estimation in Haiti: advices to minimize the seismic risk,Seismic risk; Earthquake damage; Vulnerability; Resilience; Haiti,AVERAGE HORIZONTAL COMPONENT; PORT-AU-PRINCE; GROUND-MOTION; HAZARD; FAULT; VULNERABILITY; MODELS,"This study is in the frame of the cooperative line that several Spanish Universities and other foreign partners started with the Haitian government in 2010. According to our studies (Benito et al. in An evaluation of seismic hazard in La Hispaniola, after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, 33rd General Assembly of the European Seismological Commission, Moscow, Russia, 2012) and recent scientific literature, the earthquake hazard in Haiti remains high (Calais et al. in Nat Geosci 3:794-799, 2010). In view of this, we wonder whether the country is currently ready to face another earthquake. In this sense, we estimated several damage scenarios in Port-au-Prince and Cap-Haitien associated to realistic possible major earthquakes. Our findings show that almost 50 % of the building stock of both cities would result uninhabitable due to structural damage. Around 80 % of the buildings in both cities have reinforced concrete structure with concrete block infill; however, the presence of masonry buildings becomes significant (between 25 and 45 % of the reinforced concrete buildings) in rural areas and informal settlements on the outskirts, where the estimated damage is higher. The influence of the soil effect on the damage spatial distribution is evident in both cities. We have found that the percentage of uninhabitable buildings in soft soil areas may be double the percentage obtained in nearby districts located in hard soil. These results reveal that a new seismic catastrophe of similar or even greater consequences than the 2010 Haiti earthquake might happen if the earthquake resilience is not improved in the country. Nowadays, the design of prevention actions and mitigation policies is the best instrument the society has to face seismic risk. In this sense, the results of this research might contribute to define measures oriented to earthquake risk reduction in Haiti, which should be a real priority for national and international institutions.",2016
COMPARISON AND QUANTITATIVE STUDY OF VULNERABILITY/DAMAGE CURVES IN SOUTH AFRICA,,SEISMIC-HAZARD; RISK-ASSESSMENT; EARTHQUAKE; MAGNITUDE; TULBAGH,"Southern Africa is considered a stable continental region in spite of several reported medium size earthquakes, some of which caused considerable damage and casualties. The 1969 Ceres 6.3 magnitude earthquake is considered the most destructive and caused serious damage estimated at US$24 million, with 12 mortalities and many more injured. Others include six mining related tremors which caused significant damage i.e. Welkom 1976, Klerksdorp 1977, Welkom 1989 and Carletonville 1992 seismic events. Notable for their damage to infrastructure was the 9th March 2005 Stilfontein event near Klerksdorp and 5th August 2014 event near Orkney. Most buildings and structures in South Africa are not designed to resist even relatively low intensity earthquake. Most architects, engineers and builders in South Africa do not consider seismic resistance as a design requirement. In this work, potential damage caused by strong earthquake was estimated for three classes of buildings situated in Sandton, Cape Town, Durban and Port Elizabeth. The effect of earthquakes causing damage was studied by considering the ""worst case-scenario"", i.e. the occurrence of an earthquake with the maximum possible magnitude for an area. In four studied urban areas, expected damage was estimated for three classes of buildings: unreinforced masonry, bearing wall, low rise, reinforced concrete shear wall, without moment resisting frame, medium rise, and reinforced concrete shear wall, without moment resisting frame, high rise. The results of the analysis showed that in case of occurrence of a strong earthquake, the most damage is expected for the building classified as 'unreinforced masonry, bearing wall, low rise, and reinforced concrete shear wall'.",2015
Sustainable maintenance and repair of RC coastal structures,concrete structures; maintenance & inspection; sustainability,CHLORIDE-INDUCED CORROSION; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; RELIABILITY; DIFFUSION; BRIDGES; SPAIN; PORT,"Many agencies worldwide have to manage structurally damaged reinforced concrete (RC) coastal infrastructure subjected to chloride ingress that require significant repairs. These repairs should ensure optimal levels of serviceability and safety and minimise costs and environmental impact. However, there is a wide range of protocols, techniques and materials for repair and there is not much information about their durability performance. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating, comparing and/or improving the sustainability of maintenance strategies. It was developed within the framework of the Mareo project in collaboration with the different stakeholders involved during the whole structural lifetime. It is based on probabilistic modelling of deterioration and repair, and the sustainability assessment considers costs (with conventional and intergenerational discounting), carbon dioxide emissions and waste generation. The methodology is illustrated with a numerical example aiming to evaluate and improve the sustainability of a repair technique for RC structures subjected to chloride-induced corrosion damage. Overall results indicate that sustainable solutions increase global costs but they could significantly reduce environmental impact.",2015
Adelaide's South Road Superway,bridges; concrete structures; viaducts,,"The A$825 million (428 pound million) South Road Superway project will deliver a 4.8 km long expressway standard corridor from Adelaide's Port River Expressway to Regency Road and is part of a larger programme to upgrade the whole of South Road to a high-standard, high-speed arterial link. The project features a 2.8 km long elevated roadway carrying up to eight lanes of traffic above the existing South Road. The brief for the project required the elevated roadway to have a 9 m clearance under the superstructure, minimum spans of 50 m and to provide a high standard of landscape and urban design finish. The elevated roadway viaduct consists of a match cast segmental superstructure constructed by the balanced cantilever method with multiple variations in segment cross-section to cater for the complex geometry of the alignment. Superstructure spans range from 50 m to 83 m and are constructed monolithically with elegant Y-shaped piers. Deck articulation is provided by mid-span steel needle beam expansion joints, which eliminate the requirement for large bearings under the deck. This paper provides an overview of the design and construction of the viaduct, focusing on features of both the architecture and construction methodology that led to unique design challenges.",2015

Using Fish Population Metrics to Compare the Effects of Artificial Reef Density,,GULF-OF-MEXICO; JUVENILE RED SNAPPER; LUTJANUS-CAMPECHANUS; HABITAT COMPLEXITY; SITE FIDELITY; MARINE FISH; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; NATURAL REEFS; GROWTH; TEXAS,"Artificial reefs continue to be added as habitat throughout the world, yet questions remain about how reef design affects fish diversity and abundance. In the present study, the effects of reef density were assessed for fish communities and sizes of economically valuable Lutjanus campechanus 13 km off Port Mansfield, Texas, at a reef composed of more than 4000 concrete culverts. The study spanned from May to June in 2013 and 2014, and sites sampled included natural reefs, bare areas, and varying culvert patch density categories, ranging from 1-190 culverts. Abundances of adults and species evenness of juvenile populations differed between the years. Fish communities did not significantly differ among density categories; however, highest species richness and total abundances were observed at intermediate culvert densities and at natural reefs. Whereas the abundance of L. campechanus did not differ among density categories, mean total lengths of L. campechanus were greatest at the lower density. Our findings suggest that reefs should be deployed with intermediate patch density of 71-120 culverts in a 30-m radius to yield the highest fish abundances.",2015
Reliability-based service life prediction of existing concrete structures under marine environment,chloride; existing concrete structure; service life; marine environment,CHLORIDE-INDUCED CORROSION; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; INITIATION TIME; COVER CRACKING; DURABILITY; INGRESS; BRIDGES; MODELS; WIDTH,"Chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement is considered as one of the major mechanisms resulting in the reduction of structural resistance of reinforced concrete structural elements located in marine and other aggressive environments. A study of reinforced concrete structures located at the Fangcheng dock in the Beibu Gulf port, China, was present. The result from field survey indicates that the concrete cover depth and chloride diffusion coefficient fit best normal distribution and lognormal distribution, respectively. The service life of structure is about 55 a, while initiation time is 45 a. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the most influential factor of the structure service life prediction is concrete cover, followed by diffusion coefficient, diffusion decay index, critical chloride concentration, surface chloride concentration, current density and localized pitting corrosion. Finally, the effects of diffusion decay index and critical chloride concentration on structure service life prediction are discussed.",2015
Shielding Analysis for ITER Equatorial Port Cell During Blanket Replacement,ITER; Equatorial port cell; Blanket replacement; Shielding optimization,CONCEPTUAL DESIGN; FDS; SYSTEM; CHINA; MODEL; MCAM; EAST,"ITER port cells are located outside the bio-shield of the Tokamak. During shutdown, the shielding blanket may be replaced and the radioactive blankets will be transported through equatorial port cells, increasing the radiation exposure in the gallery. To examine the dose rate in the gallery with respect to the dose limitation specified by ITER, the activation of typical shielding blanket was calculated using the cell based rigorous two-step method. Then the activated blankets were loaded in cask and moved to the port cell, the radiation level in the port cell and gallery during the worst case was calculated. The shielding capability of port cell door was analyzed and the design was optimized based on the present proposal. As shown from the results, the dose rate from cask is much higher than that from activated Tokamak. The main concern for port cell door should be the concrete lintel and penetrations through it, providing basis for further engineering design of the port cell shielding.",2015

There is, however, strong evidence to suggest that these structures are poor surrogates for natural rocky shores, often supporting assemblages with lower species abundance and diversity. Ecological engineering opportunities to enhance structures for biodiversity conservation (and other management goals) are therefore being sought, but the majority of work so far has concentrated on structural design features at the centimetre-meter scale. We deployed concrete tiles with four easily-reproducible fine-scale (millimetre) textures (control, smoothed, grooved and exposed aggregate) in the intertidal zone to test opportunities for facilitating colonisation by a dominant ecosystem engineer (barnacles) relative to natural rock. Concrete texture had a significant effect on colonisation; smoothed tiles supported significantly fewer numbers of barnacles, and those with intermediate roughness (grooved concrete) significantly greater numbers, after one settlement season. The successful recruitment of early colonists is a critical stage in the development of more complex and diverse macrobenthic assemblages, especially those that provide physical habitat structure for other species. Our observations show that this can be facilitated relatively simply for barnacles on marine concrete by manipulating surface heterogeneity at a millimetre scale. Alongside other larger-scale manipulation (e.g. creating holes and pools), including fine-scale habitat heterogeneity in engineering designs can support international efforts to maximise the ecological value of marine urban infrastructure.

CONCRETE PAVEMENTS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA,,,"In many parts of the world concrete (rigid) pavements have been proven to provide a longer pavement life with less maintenance and rehabilitation requirements than flexible pavements surfaced with asphalt and seals. Though commonly adopted in some Eastern Australian states, they represent only a small portion of the road network in Western Australia (WA). The aim of this article is to summarise the locations where concrete pavements are already in use in WA and to highlight some of the design and construction methods used. Historically in WA, pavements constructed using concrete have been adopted for problematic causeway locations and components of industrial pavements. Examples of concrete causeways can be found in the Gascoyne, Kimberley and Pilbara Regions. These 'pavements' have not been designed following typical concrete pavement design methods; rather structural or slab- on-grade design methods. Likewise the use of concrete pavements for industrial applications is also uncommon. Where they have been adopted the Guide to Industrial Floors and Pavements, design, construction and specification method published by the Cement and Concrete Association of Australia (CCAA) has generally been adopted. Only recently Main Roads WA has opted to utilise rigid pavements at selected new junctions in the north of the State and in the Perth metropolitan area for sections of pavement that are subjected periodically to saturated conditions. These pavements have been designed following the Austroads Design of Rigid Pavements method with joint detailing and specifications based on New South Wales (NSW) Roads and Maritime Services (RMS) requirements, with local variations. These sections include heavily trafficked junctions where jointed plain concrete pavement (PCP) was adopted as an alternative to traditional granular pavements with thin bituminous surfacings and full depth asphalt pavements in very hot climatic regions (e.g. Dampier Highway Duplication and Great Northern Highway Realignment in Port Hedland); and sections with high water table levels designed with continuously reinforced concrete pavement (CRCP) (Gateway, WA project). This article outlines the experience with concrete pavements in WA, including design and construction challenges, performance records and maintenance issues. It discusses regional traffic and environmental conditions, as well as locally available materials, explaining how they influenced the pavement design and the adaptation of construction specifications.",2015

During 432 deployments over 12 months, 291 marine debris items were identified; of which most (92%) were plastic, and more specifically shopping bags, food packages, candy wrappers and cups typically >21 mm long. The most contaminated sectors were those closest to Paranagua city and the adjacent port, and had up to 23.37 +/- 3.22 pieces ha(-1). Less urbanized sectors had between 12.84 +/- 1.49 and 9.32 +/- 1.10 pieces ha(-1). Contamination did not vary between dry or wet seasons, but rather was probably affected by consistent urban disposal and localized hydrological processes. Marine debris might be minimized by using more environment friendly materials, however a concrete solution requires adequately integrating local government and civil society. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS of DARKNET TRAFFIC CHARACTERISTICS BETWEEN DARKNET SENSORS,Darknet; network security; network monitoring; TCP; UDP,,"Today, Internet is incessantly attacked by wide variety of network-based threats. One of the ways to monitor or identify such prevailing threats is to monitor incoming traffic to unused network addresses popularly known as darknet and often also referred with various other names like network telescope or black hole. As, all the traffic arriving at darknet is mainly the result from malicious probing or misconfiguration in the network. It is expected that to have similar incoming traffic behaviour across different darknet sensors, however, various studies found it different. Various reason cited behind it is misconfiguration, certain kind of attack, difference in filtering parameter or system configuration itself. However, concrete reason beside this is still missing. In this regard, to get further understanding, in this study, we performed deeper comparative analysis between two darknet sensors (KISTI Darknet network) that are differently located but have similar filtering and system configuration. Comparative analysis considering total incoming packet, number of source host, targeting destination port and protocol revealed that there exists wide difference in incoming traffic characteristics between the darknet sensors. Moreover, for TCP and UDP comparison, UDP traffic showed more targeting behaviour to particular darknet block (difference in traffic characteristics between darknet sensors), in contrast to it, TCP traffic showed more scanning behaviour (similarity in traffic characteristics between darknet sensor).",2015

Upgrading the Neutron Radiography Facility in South Africa (SANRAD): Concrete Shielding Design Characteristics,SANRAD; Neutron Radiography; Shielding Characteristics,FRM-II; ANTARES,"A common denominator of all neutron radiography (NRAD) facilities worldwide is that the perimeter of the experimental chamber of the facility is a radiation shielding structure which, in some cases, also includes flight tube and filter chamber structures. These chambers are normally both located on the beam port floor outside the biological shielding of the neutron source. The main function of the NRAD-shielding structure is to maintain a radiological safe working environment in the entire beam hall according to standards set by individual national radiological safety regulations. In addition, the shielding's integrity and capability should not allow, during NRAD operations, an increase in radiation levels in the beam port hall and thus negatively affect adjacent scientific facilities (e.g. neutron diffraction facilities). As a bonus, the shielding for the NRAD facility should also prevent radiation scattering towards the detector plane and doing so, thus increase the capability of obtaining better quantitative results. This paper addresses Monte Carlo neutron-particle transport simulations to theoretically optimize the shielding capabilities of the biological barrier for the SANRAD facility at the SAFARI-1 nuclear research reactor in South Africa. The experimental process to develop the shielding, based on the principles of the ANTARES facility, is described. After casting, the homogeneity distribution of these concrete mix materials is found to be near perfect and first order experimental radiation shielding characteristics through film badge (TLD) exposure show acceptable values and trends in neutron-and gamma-ray attenuation.

Au Foil Activation Measurement and Simulation of the Concrete Neutron Shielding Ability for the Proposed New SANRAD Facility,neutrons; shielding; radiography; foil activation,,"The purpose of this study was to measure the effective neutron shielding characteristics of the new shielding material designed and manufactured to be used for the construction of the new SANRAD facility at Necsa, South Africa, through Au foil activation as well as MCNP simulations. The shielding capability of the high density shielding material was investigated in the worst case region (the neutron beam axis) of the experimental chamber for two operational modes. The everyday operational mode includes the 15cm thick poly crystalline Bismuth filter at room temperature (assumed) to filter gamma-rays and some neutron spectrum energies. The second mode, dynamic imaging, will be conducted without the Bi-filter. The objective was achieved through a foil activation measurement at the current SANRAD facility and MCNP calculations. Several Au foils were imbedded at different thicknesses (two at each position) of shielding material up to 80cm thick to track the attenuation of the neutron beam over distance within the shielding material. The neutron flux and subsequently the associated dose rates were calculated from the activation levels of the Au foils. The concrete shielding material was found to provide adequate shielding for all energies of neutrons emerging from beam port no-2 of the SAFARI-1 research reactor within a thickness of 40cm of concrete.

Effect of Stiffness on Performance of Diaphragm Wall,Diaphragm wall; Anchor rod; Berthing structure,,"Diaphragm walls are generally constructed using stiff concrete of same stiffness throughout. Research has shown that as wall flexibility increases, the stress imposed by the soil redistribute and reduces structural forces on wall. Approximately five fold reduction in maximum bending moment occurred when wall stiffness was reduced from that of a 1m concrete section to that of a Frodinghamn1N sheet pile. Unfortunately this beneficial effect is accompanied by greater wall and soil movements (Potts & Day, 1991). So the diaphragm wall cannot be too flexible also. In this paper static analysis of two different diaphragm wall sections of varying stiffness is carried out using PLAXIS software for the load condition existing at deep draft berth of New Mangalore Port, and the performances of these sections are compared with previous study performed by Yajnheswaran et al. (2015). The diaphragm wall sections used in analysis are modeled as single panel. The length of the panel is taken as 5m. Anchors are provided at + 2.5m.

IMPROVING THE LEARNING EXPERIENCES OF MATHEMATICS OF SOUTH AFRICAN PRIMARY SCHOOL LEARNERS THROUGH MANIPULATIVE ASSISTANCE,Manipulatives; Mathematics; primary school; South Africa,,"When children see, hear, taste, touch or smell objects, they experience physical, perceptual qualities that enable them to form mental representations of the objects. Piaget's theory argues that since children construct mathematical knowledge through their thinking, manipulatives should play a role in encouraging children to think and solve problems. A manipulative is any of various objects designed to be moved or arranged by hand as a means of developing motor skills or understanding abstractions. Piaget emphasized that learners should be given the opportunity to experimentally and actively manipulate objects - an experience which is likely to enhance the learner's grasp of the transformation of objects and their associated relations. This is significantly applicable to the South African context because the Revised National Curriculum Statement focuses on hands-on activity-based learning. The research paradigm for this investigation was guided by a social construction discourse. Social construction theory suggests that our understanding the world in which we live is constructed through interaction with others and the world in which we live. This poster will elucidate the research process implemented to investigate the role that manipulatives play in the teaching and learning of Mathematics. The objective of this research was to investigate whether learners' performance in Mathematics can be enhanced by the use of manipulatives. Mixed method research was applied using both the quantitative and the qualitative research designs. The sample consisted of 60 Grade 6 learners from two different schools in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. School A was a private school with learners from predominant upper class families, while School B was a public school catering mainly for a middle class society. The quantitative phase of the project consisted of experimental research. In each school an experimental and control group were used. The experimental groups were exposed to manipilatives during teaching and learning of new content, but the control group not. Thereafter, all groups wrote the same test. The data were quantitatively analysed by means of computer software using descriptive statistics. For the qualitative part of the research the participants filled out a questionnaire on their experiences in using manipulatives during the learning process. This data were analysed for similarities and differences to see whether any significant themes emerged. A review of relevant literature was also undertaken to place the research in context and to recontextualize findings. The necessary ethical measures were applied. Trustworthiness was obtained by incorporating triangulation to ensure validity and reliability. The quantitative results showed that the use of concrete manipulatives provided opportunities for the promotion of greater understanding, while the qualitative findings showed that the learners enjoyed the lessons with manipulatives more and found the learning to be more meaningful.",2015

In this paper, in order to assess the influence of various parameters on the behavior of the wharf, Using finite element software ABAQUS, Kobe Port Caisson Wharf is modeled and under the force of the waves, the impact of changes in Concrete Hardness of the Wharf, The width of the wharf, Width and height of the toe and heel, Permeability and internal friction angle of the embankment behind the wharf And the amount of overhead is located on the wharf, on Vertical displacement occurred in structures is investigated. Finally Concludes that Change in the angle of internal friction and permeability of the embankment behind the wharf has not effect on Vertical displacement of the Wharf and Increases in parameters such as the width of the wharf, the width of toe and heel, concrete Hardness of the wharf And the amount of overhead based on it, Will Reduce Vertical displacement of the wharf.",2015
SEISMIC MATERIAL PROPERTIES OF REINFORCED CONCRETE AND STEEL CASING COMPOSITE CONCRETE IN ELEVATED PILE-GROUP FOUNDATION,pseudo-static tests; material properties; reinforced concrete; steel composite concrete,,"The paper focuses on the material mechanics properties of reinforced concrete and steel casing composite concrete under pseudo-static loads and their application in structure. Although elevated pile-group foundation is widely used in bridge, port and ocean engineering, the seismic performance of this type of foundation still need further study. Four scale-specimens of the elevated pile-group foundation were manufactured by these two kinds of concrete and seismic performance characteristic of each specimen were compared. Meanwhile, the special soil box was designed and built to consider soil-pile-superstructure interaction. According to the test result, the peak strength of strengthening specimens is about 1.77 times of the others and the ultimate displacement is 1.66 times of the RC specimens. Additionally, the dissipated hysteric energy capability of strengthening specimens is more than 2.15 times of the others as the equivalent viscous damping ratio is reduced by 50%. The pinching effect of first two specimens is more obvious than latter two specimens and the hysteretic loops of reinforced specimens are more plumpness. The pseudo-static tests also provided the data to quantitatively assessment the positive effect of steel casing composite concrete in aseismatic design of bridge.",2015
Probability distribution functions for cover used in 3-D model simulating concrete deterioration in port assets,,CORROSION CRACKING; TIME,"In previous studies, a 1-D numerical predictive tool to simulate the salt induced corrosion of port assets in Australia has been developed into a 2-D and 3-D model based on current predictive probabilistic models. These studies use a probability distribution function based on the mean and standard deviation of the parameters for a structure incorporating surface chloride concentration, diffusion coefficient and cover. In this paper, this previous work is extended through an investigation of the distribution of actual cover by specified cover, element type and method of construction. Significant differences are found for the measured cover within structures, by method of construction, element type and specified cover. The data are not normally distributed and extreme values, usually low, are found in a number of locations. Elements cast insitu are less likely to meet the specified cover and the measured cover is more dispersed than those in elements which are precast. Individual probability distribution functions are available and are tested against the original function. Methods of combining results so that one distribution is available for a structure are formulated and evaluated. The ability to utilise the model for structures where no measurement have been taken is achieved by transposing results based on the specified cover.",2015
Effects of Curing Conditions on Properties of Ternary (Ordinary Portland Cement/Fly Ash/Silica Fume) Concrete,curing; durability; fly ash; high-performance concrete; silica fume; ternary mixture,HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE; SILICA FUME; FLY-ASH; CARBONATION; DURABILITY; RESISTANCE,"This paper presents the effects of various curing methods that are frequently encountered in the field on several properties of ternary (OPC/FA/SF) concrete mixtures containing ordinary port-land cement (OPC), 20 or 30% of Class C fly ash (FA), and 5 or 7% of silica fume (SF). The curing conditions evaluated in the study included: air drying (absence of wet burlap, plastic sheet, or curing compound), 7-day curing compound application, 3-day curing under wet burlap, and 7-day curing under wet burlap. The properties studied at both early and late ages included compressive strength, salt scaling resistance, resistance to chloride ion penetration (RCP), initial rate of absorption (sorptivity), and free shrinkage. The ANOVA analysis was performed to identify statistically significant differences in the test results for the different curing conditions. In addition, the impact of curing conditions on the respective properties was compared in the quantitative manner",2015
A Study on the Lifecycle of Reinforced Concrete Structures Treated with Surface Penetrants,,,"Surface penetrants are highly effective for controlling ingress of degrading agents such as chloride ions and water, and being easy to apply, they are considered an effective material for extending the life of reinforced concrete structures exposed to salt water or harsh salt-damage environments such as in ports. Moreover, there are various surface penetrants available on the market today. However, many points are unclear regarding the degree of difference in efficacy between different surface penetrants for controlling the ingress of degrading agents in reinforced concrete structures in salt-water or port environments. That is to say, the life-extending effect of each type of surface penetrant on reinforced concrete structures is also unclear. This paper examines the lifecycle of such structures by investigating the effects of various surface penetrants on controlling the ingress of chloride ions, as well as estimating the penetration of chloride ions and confirming the resulting life-extending effect.",2015
Corrosion resistant property of stainless steel bars in concrete under marine environment,,,"For the durability enhancement of port RC structures. corrosion resistant property of three types of stainless steel bars (SUS430, SUS304 and SUS316) in concrete was studied by the exposure tests under marine environment. Results obtained are as follows. i) No corrosion was observed at the sound part on all types of stainless steels under high concentration of chloride ion. Here, the threshold levels for corrosion were estimated larger than 13-14 kg/m(3) . ii) No corrosion was observed at the small cracked part on all types of stainless steels where the crack width was smaller than 0.5mm. On the other hand, slight corrosion was observed at the large crack regions where the crack width was larger than 0.5mm on SUS 304 and 316. iii) In case that stainless steel bar is applied to port RC structures, the life cycle cost can be lower than the case of carbon steel bar.",2015
Experimental study on interface corrosion between steel and concrete,,,"Nowadays, steel-concrete hybrid members and structures are widely used in the various types of structures such as bridges, buildings and port structures. The interface between steel and concrete exists everywhere in the steel-concrete hybrid structures. Generally the corrosion of the interface between steel and concrete does not occur due to the alkaline environment of concrete. However, if the interface corrosion between steel and concrete occurs, the durability of the steel-concrete hybrid structures may be interfered. Therefore, this issue is required to investigate soon. In this paper, generation and progress of the interface corrosion between steel and concrete are investigated using the element test specimen which simulates the actual interface condition in the steel-concrete hybrid structures. Several types of element exposure tests are conducted, that is, the test focusing on the effect of the different environment of corrosion condition, the test focusing on the effect of the bond between steel and concrete, and the existence of the paint on the steel plate. Moreover, the effect of humidity on the interface neutralization of the concrete surface and the corrosion of the steel plate is investigated. As a result, the effect of the various parameters on the interface corrosion between steel and concrete are investigated through the experiments, and the mechanism of generation and progress of the interface corrosion between steel and concrete is predicted based on the experimental data.",2015
Heavy Rail below the 100-Year Flood Elevation - Innovations in Design: A Case Study,,,"To decouple the heavy rail entrance into the Port of Vancouver USA from a major north/south mainline of the nation's rail system, a rail-under-rail grade-separation structure was designed along the northern bank of the Columbia River in Vancouver, Washington. To provide the required 23.5 foot (7.2 meter) clearance below an existing 100-year old rail bridge that crosses the river, the new rail line needed to descend more than 14 feet (4.3 meters) below the 100-year flood elevation. Because trains need to remain in operation during this flood condition, protection of the rail line from flood waters was required. Several innovative design solutions were developed to meet this design criteria in the most efficient manner. This case study is of regional, national, and international interest. The paper will discuss the project's constraints, design challenges, and solutions utilized to meet the project criteria. The location and configuration of the structure posed special challenges and the solutions for this project will be of interest to practicing structural engineers as well as rail operators, owners, and land use professionals. The rail structure itself, a 1,350-foot (411.5 meter) long portion of the new rail entrance for the port, is a partially elevated reinforced concrete structure that protects the rail from flood waters and supports it along the irregular river bank. To resist flood waters, a continuous reinforced concrete U-shaped trench was selected as the optimal solution. This selection of structure type was the first of many challenges for this project. The superstructure borrows design innovations from the continuously reinforced concrete pavement industry to help eliminate expansion joints over the entire length of the structure. This helps minimize water infiltration during flood events and reduces lifetime maintenance costs. The substructure consists of closely spaced driven steel batter piles that support the majority of the rail trench structure and is extremely compatible with the expansion joint-free design. The new rail trench structure provides a unique facility that meets the design challenges of the site, maximizes operational efficiency for the port, and relieves congestion at this critical location along the Pacific Northwest's high-speed rail corridor.",2015
Dose estimation and shielding calculation for X-ray hazard at high intensity laser facilities,X-ray; high intensity laser; dose; shielding; Monte Carlo,SOLID TARGETS; PHOTON; ABSORPTION; RADIATION; ELECTRON; PLASMA,"An ionizing radiation hazard produced from the interaction between high intensity lasers and solid targets has been observed. Laser-plasma interactions create ""hot"" electrons, which generate bremsstrahlung X-rays when they interact with ions in the target. However, up to now only limited studies have been conducted on this laser-induced radiological protection issue. In this paper, the physical process and characteristics of the interaction between high intensity lasers and solid targets are analyzed. The parameters of the radiation sources are discussed, including the energy conversion efficiency from laser to hot electrons, hot electron energy spectrum and electron temperature, and the bremsstrahlung X-ray energy spectrum produced by hot electrons. Based on this information, the X-ray dose generated with high-Z targets for laser intensities between 10(14) and 10(20) W/cm(2) is estimated. The shielding effects of common shielding items such as the glass view port, aluminum chamber wall and concrete wall are also studied using the FLUKA Monte Carlo code. This study provides a reference for the dose estimation and the shielding design of high intensity laser facilities.",2014
Tritium and heat management in ITER Test Blanket Systems port cell for maintenance operations,ITER; TBM; Breeding blanket; Tritium management,,"Three ITER equatorial port cells are dedicated to the assessment of six different designs of breeding blankets, known as Test Blanket Modules (TBMs). Several high temperature components and pipework will be present in each TBM port cell and will release a significant quantity of heat that has to be extracted in order to avoid the ambient air and concrete wall temperatures to exceed allowable limits. Moreover, from these components and pipes, a fraction of the contained tritium permeates and/or leaks into the port cell. This paper describes the optimization of the heat extraction management during operation, and the tritium concentration control required for entry into the port cell to proceed with the required maintenance operations after the plasma shutdown.

Maintenance Design and Optimization of Long Service Life Port Structures Considering Crack Control Levels,port structure; steel corrosion; chloride penetration; maintenance cost; crack control,CYCLE COST; CONCRETE; CORROSION; STRATEGIES; STEEL; ENVIRONMENT; WIDTH,"This paper investigates the maintenance design for reinforced concrete (RC) elements in a marine port with service life of 100 years. The dominant deterioration process is the chloride-induced corrosion of reinforcement steel bars in RC elements, and the durability limit state (DLS) is defined as the corrosion initiation. The impact of concrete crack on steel corrosion is described by the acceleration effect of the micro-damaged zones in concrete besides crack opening. Then the maintenance cost model is established considering both operation and user's costs. The Monte-Carlo simulation technique is used to evaluate the intervention times of maintenance operations. In particular, the influence of crack control width on maintenance costs is investigated. The results show that: (1) the necessary maintenance achieves always the optimized cost, and (2) the crack width of 0.3 mm is the turning point for flexural elements in terms of maintenance costs.",2014
The Use of Dredged Sediments as Sand in the Mortars for Tunnel Lining and for Environmental Protection,Sustainable development; Dredged sediments; Tunnel lining; Mortars; Mechanical properties; Durability,CONCRETE; HARBOR,"The economic activity of many ports in Algeria is hampered by the natural phenomenon of sediment accumulation. Dredging is a necessity; however, the storage of the dredged sediments (DS) is a problem for harbour managers. The easy and low-cost solution of dumping sediments at sea raises environmental concerns that could eventually be alleviated by considering these sediments as a new source of construction materials. This would contribute to the reduction of marine pollution and thus give harbour managers the opportunity to be part of the sustainable development approach. This paper examines the feasibility of using DS from the Port of Oran as partial replacement of sand in mortars. The physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of DS were determined after a zoning study was made. DS were treated in order to reduce their salt and water contents so that they could be used as a partial substitution of the sand in the composition of the mortars. The mechanical and durability properties of mortars fabricated by substituting 10, 15 and 20 % of sand mass by DS were determined and compared to those of the reference mortar. The compressive strengths of a first set of mortar specimens were determined after 7, 28, 60 and 90 days of moist curing. The second set of mortar specimens that were submitted to chemical attacks and their residual compressive strengths at 118 days were determined. So far, the preliminary laboratory tests show that partial replacement of 20 % of sand by DS in mortars gives good results.",2014

Stakeholder perceptions and involvement in the implementation of EMS in ports in Vietnam and Cambodia,EMS; Pollution; Seaport; South East Asia; Stakeholder involvement,ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT; ISO 14000 CERTIFICATION; NONRESPONSE BIAS; CHAIN MANAGEMENT; RESPONSE RATES; PERFORMANCE; CORPORATE; ISO-14001; SYSTEMS,"To tackle environmental issues and ensure compliance with regulations, three ports in Vietnam and two ports in Cambodia implemented an Environmental Management System (EMS). The first steps of the EMS were completed during the period 2006-2007, with the establishment of the Port Environmental Policy, the Register of Environmental Aspects and an EMS Programme. Priorities in environmental protection have been identified for each of the ports. The initial assessment of the EMS, based on the documented EMS, was completed by experts from the ECOPORT Foundation, who issued a Port Environmental Review System (PERS) certificate for the ports. This paper presents an assessment of the implementation of the EMS through the eyes of various groups of port stakeholders. The second focus is on the manner of involving stakeholders in the EMS process, which has stakeholder participation as one of its core principles. The assessment was done via interviews with the environmental coordinators or managers at each port, as well as key port stakeholders. Eight groups of stakeholders are identified and classified into internal/external and voluntary/involuntary categories. Their salience is then assessed based on their legitimacy, power, urgency and proximity. The findings show that while ports are perceived as sources of environmental problems, they are also seen as important economic powerhouses. EMS is therefore needed at the ports to ensure their environmental performance is in line with their economic contribution. However, ports generally view other stakeholders as outsiders and exclude them from the process of designing environmental protection measures. Even though the stakeholders are strongly interested in contributing more to the process, there is no concrete plan for involving them in the management of the port. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To enjoy the fully-fledged advantages of reasoning, EAST-ADL models could benefit from a component-aware analysis framework that provides, ideally, both verification and model-based test-case generation capabilities. While different verification techniques have been developed for architectural models, only a few target EAST-ADL. In this paper, we present a methodology for code validation, starting from EAST-ADL artifacts. The methodology relies on: (i) automated model-based test-case generation for functional requirements criteria based on the EAST-ADL model extended with timed automata semantics, and (ii) validation of system implementation by generating Python test scripts based on the abstract test-cases. The scripts represent concrete test-cases that are executable on the system implementation.

High-temperature Closure Control Technology of Concrete Arch Bridge Using Cable-Stayed Buckle and Cantilever Construction Method,Reinforced concrete arch bridge; Cable-stayed buckle and cantilever construction method; High-temperature closure; Pre-jacking force; Counterweight,,"The problem of high temperature closure of concrete arch bridge using cable-stayed buckle and cantilever method was resolved by pre-jacking force and counterweight in the arch rib closure port. The arch closure status effect of temperature difference was error array, the unit pre-jacking force and unit counterweight were impact parameter array. The impact matrix was the arch closure status effect of unit pre-jacking force or unit counterweight. The matrix equation was established on the error and the impact of parameters.

It was applied to achieve the closure of arch bridge using cable-stayed buckle and cantilever in any high temperature conditions.",2014
AN ANALYSIS OF BASES FOR DEFINING LEVEL OF THE PORT MACHINERY FLEXIBILITY IN A MULTIPURPOSE SEAPORT,seaport; port machinery; flexibility,,"Decision on which port machinery to select in a multipurpose seaport is very complex and under influence of a broad range of factors. According to the most relevant recommended selection methodologies, basic influential factors that have to be taken into account can be classified into five major classes: port development factors, equipment costs, factors related to equipment maintenance, manning requirements and operating factors. Level of the port machinery flexibility (its both main components: technological and positional flexibility), as an element of the class of influential factors titled ""operating factors"" has high importance in a multipurpose seaport due to intensive variations in volume and characters of port customers demands over the time. After some general considerations related to system flexibility, this paper is focused on general aspects of the port machinery selection process and, than, port machinery flexibility is analyzed in details.

Physical Analysis of Thermalization in Thermal Column Irradiation Position,,,"The TRIGA Mark II research reactor at the Jozef Stefan Institute features several ex-core irradiation facilities that can be used for different applications. One of the irradiation positions is a rectangular port inside the Thermal Column, a graphite stack that extends from the graphite reflector to the outer concrete wall of the reactor and thermalizes the neutrons leaking from the reactor core. Due to the surrounding graphite, the port features a well-thermalized neutron flux with a thermal to fast flux ratio of up to 500 to 1. In order to understand the thermalization process in the Thermal Column, we analyzed the path of neutrons from the reactor to the irradiation point and importance of various components to the thermalization process. The MCNP6 Monte Carlo transport code and the thoroughly validated model of the JSI TRIGA reactor were used to perform calculations. The ratio of thermal to fast neutron flux was calculated throughout the graphite stack and the relative changes due to the inserted heavy water for a particular application were calculated. In addition the angular neutron flux inside the Thermal Column was estimated. The results of the study will be used for future design of irradiation devices that require highly thermalized neutron flux.",2014

A field campaign measurement made in 2006 has shown the performance of the capacitive probe developed by the IFSTTAR. Nevertheless, some results are not understood, and in particular the behaviour of the probe when cement exudation product are present in the duct. Without an accurate knowledge of the electromagnetic properties of those products it is impossible to quantitatively assess the results of our capacitive probe. This paper reports the development of a coaxial transmission line feature. It was designed to allow the evaluation of a large type of material (liquid, paste or granular) over a large frequency range (50 MHz-4 GHz at maximum). A calibration scheme developed before at the Fresnel Institute was used. Using a two port S parameter instrument, the complex permittivity and magnetic permeability were evaluated by frequency domain measurement. The electromagnetic characterization of cement paste, cement exudation products and injection wax has brought us some key results in the interpretation of the capacitive probe signal. The results of this characterization were then used in a 3D semi analytical modelling of the problem. The studies of configurations with exudation products are presented and compared to experimental results obtained with our capacitive probe on laboratory duct. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Forwarding Metamorphosis: Fast Programmable Match-Action Processing in Hardware for SDN,Design; RMT model; Reconfigurable Match Tables; SDN,,"In Software Defined Networking (SDN) the control plane is physically separate from the forwarding plane. Control software programs the forwarding plane (e.g., switches and routers) using an open interface, such as OpenFlow. This paper aims to overcomes two limitations in current switching chips and the OpenFlow protocol: i) current hardware switches are quite rigid, allowing ""Match-Action"" processing on only a fixed set of fields, and ii) the OpenFlow specification only defines a limited repertoire of packet processing actions. We propose the RMT (reconfigurable match tables) model, a new RISC-inspired pipelined architecture for switching chips, and we identify the essential minimal set of action primitives to specify how headers are processed in hardware. RMT allows the forwarding plane to be changed in the field without modifying hardware. As in OpenFlow, the programmer can specify multiple match tables of arbitrary width and depth, subject only to an overall resource limit, with each table configurable for matching on arbitrary fields. However, RMT allows the programmer to modify all header fields much more comprehensively than in OpenFlow. Our paper describes the design of a 64 port by 10 Gb/s switch chip implementing the RMT model. Our concrete design demonstrates, contrary to concerns within the community, that flexible OpenFlow hardware switch implementations are feasible at almost no additional cost or power.",2013
"Coral Colonisation of an Artificial Reef in a Turbid Nearshore Environment, Dampier Harbour, Western Australia",,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; EARLY POSTSETTLEMENT MORTALITY; SCLERACTINIAN CORAL; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; PACIFIC REEFS; NATURAL REEFS; RECRUITMENT; SURVIVAL; PATTERNS; AGE,"A 0.6 hectare artificial reef of local rock and recycled concrete sleepers was constructed in December 2006 at Parker Point in the industrial port of Dampier, western Australia, with the aim of providing an environmental offset for a nearshore coral community lost to land reclamation. Corals successfully colonised the artificial reef, despite the relatively harsh environmental conditions at the site (annual water temperature range 18-32 degrees C, intermittent high turbidity, frequent cyclones, frequent nearby ship movements). Coral settlement to the artificial reef was examined by terracotta tile deployments, and later stages of coral community development were examined by in-situ visual surveys within fixed 25 x 25 cm quadrats on the rock and concrete substrates. Mean coral density on the tiles varied from 113 +/- 17 SE to 909 +/- 85 SE per m(2) over five deployments, whereas mean coral density in the quadrats was only 6.0 +/- 1.0 SE per m(2) at eight months post construction, increasing to 24.0 +/- 2.1 SE per m(2) at 62 months post construction. Coral taxa colonising the artificial reef were a subset of those on the surrounding natural reef, but occurred in different proportions-Pseudosiderastrea tayami, Mycedium elephantotus and Leptastrea purpurea being disproportionately abundant on the artificial reef. Coral cover increased rapidly in the later stages of the study, reaching 2.3 +/- 0.7 SE % at 62 months post construction. This study indicates that simple materials of opportunity can provide a suitable substrate for coral recruitment in Dampier Harbour, and that natural colonisation at the study site remains sufficient to initiate a coral community on artificial substrate despite ongoing natural and anthropogenic perturbations.",2013
Strategic Vision of a Euro-Mediterranean Port City: A Case Study of Palermo,gate city; bottom-up approach; creative city; urban renewal; CIE; NAIADE,,"Italian harbours assume a decisive role in order to develop a Euro-Mediterranean web for maritime transportation. The geostrategic position of the Italian peninsula can be seen as a logistic platform at the centre of the maritime trades in the Mediterranean area, giving to its port cities the role of gateway of economic flows. The port poles, meant as hubs, are able to attract investments and create economic growth and territorial development through new operative models of urban usage and management. The management policies have to consider the environmental characteristics and distinctive features, respecting the identity of the places as concrete evidence of history, a source of intellectual development and therefore, cultural richness. In this sense, the current strategic plan ""Palermo capital of the Euro-Mediterranean area"" imagines the whole city, and not just its harbour, as a ""gate city"", a sustainable and cosmopolitan city in the view of a recentralization of the Mediterranean area.

Analysis of a damaged 12-storey frame-wall concrete building during the 2010 Haiti earthquake - Part II: Nonlinear numerical simulations,nonlinear analysis; RC building; frame-wall interaction; Haiti earthquake; structural damage,CONFINED CONCRETE; RC FRAME; MODEL; NORTHRIDGE; ELEMENTS,"After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, which destroyed a significant part of the seismically vulnerable city of Port-au-Prince, the country's capital, a 12-storey reinforced concrete building that behaved well was investigated to understand its dynamic response. This paper completes the experimental work presented in a companion paper, in which the dynamic properties of the building were obtained from ambient vibration tests, and from which a finite-element model was updated. This paper's main objectives are: (i) to understand the causes that led to the observed structural damage; and (ii) to estimate the likely seismic excitation at the site of the building. Several nonlinear analyses involving various ground motion intensities were conducted and the results were compared with the damage reported during the on-site survey. The numerical models reproduced the observed damages well and helped to explain them. The overall response of the mixed stiff frame-wall structure was clearly dominated by the high stiffness of the shear walls, showing that this type of structural system helps in keeping reasonable interstorey drift levels. Overall, the building's structure seems to have responded linearly to all the ground motions investigated, but deformation demands imposed to the frame by the shear walls lead to local damages.",2013
Seismic analyses of conventional and improved marginal wharves,marginal wharves; ports; soil-structure interaction; performance-based design; earthquake engineering,CYCLIC MOBILITY; CONCRETE; MODEL,"Marginal wharves are key components in providing functionality of port facilities. Ports are central components of the US economy. Earthquake damage to a port can disrupt the economic stability. Therefore, port facilities must be able to quickly return to full operation shortly after a seismic event. Prior studies have shown that integrity of marginal wharves may be compromised by excessive soil movement and structural damage. The latter is often localized at pile-to-wharf connections and in the pile body buried within the soil. Recent research has resulted in an improved connection design that mitigates damage. This study was undertaken to evaluate the full seismic performance of marginal wharves including both conventional and damage-resisting connections. A series of finite element models of a representative pile-supported wharf facility were created. The models varied in their moment-resisting pile-to-wharf connections. A total-stress analysis approach was used to capture the soil response along with p-y, t-z, and Q-z soil-structure interaction springs. Validated connection interface elements were integrated with non-linear frame elements to simulate the marginal wharf structure and substructure. Non-linear static pushover and dynamic time history analyses, for three different hazard levels, were performed. The results of the numerical simulations were used to assess the performance of the marginal wharf including estimates of crane damage and port downtime.

Use of polymer-impregnated concrete permanent form in marine environment: 10-year outdoor exposure in Saudi Arabia,Carbonation depth; Chloride ion penetration; Compressive strength; Outdoor exposure; Permanent form; Polymer-impregnated concrete,,"Chloride diffusion is one of the main factors that affect concrete durability in harsh Arabian Gulf environment. This happens due to severe ground and ambient salinity and large fluctuations in temperature and humidity regimes and shortening the life span of the concrete structures. To study the performance of polymer-impregnated concrete permanent form (PICPF) to prevent chloride penetration, polymer-impregnated concrete panels (450 x 900 x 25 mm) were prepared as permanent forms for large-scale retaining reversible T-shaped reinforced concrete walls (Standard concrete wall and concrete wall covered with PICPF) and exposed to extremely aggressive environment site of the port city, Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia for more than 10 years. The foundation and lower half part of concrete walls were embedded into ground near the sea. This study focused on the use of PICPF in marine environment to prevent chloride ions penetration from atmosphere, ground and sea. The performance of PICPF to protect large-scale concrete walls from chloride attack from ground, atmosphere and sea was evaluated; core specimens were taken from concrete walls after 1.5-year, 5.4-year and 10.6-year outdoor exposure, and tested for carbonation depth, chloride ions penetration depth, and compressive strength. It was found that covering all surfaces of concrete walls with PICPF proved to be much effective in controlling water evaporation from concrete walls to atmosphere and to protect chloride attack from atmosphere, underground water and sea.

Evolution of research themes in Maritime Policy & Management19732012,,LOGISTICS ACADEMIC JOURNALS; EFFICIENCY MEASUREMENT; OPERATIONS-RESEARCH; SHIPPING INDUSTRY; SEAPORT RESEARCH; PORT ECONOMICS; IMPACT; TRANSPORTATION; CLASSIFICATION; PERFORMANCE,"From its first issue in 1973, Maritime Policy & Management (MPM) has sought to be the main outlet for shipping and port research. During its 40-year development, it has indeed become the flagship journal in the field marked by its inclusion into the SSCI list in 2011. This paper examines how maritime research has developed over the last four decades by reviewing all the published papers in MPM. There has been a remarkable inflow of authors and institutions to MPM in recent decades especially from Asian countries. While shipping' research has been the most popular research area, a relative increase in ports' research has been observed in recent years. While economics has been a dominant disciplinary base, management-related disciplines contributed to the journal in the 2000s, increasing the disciplinary diversity of MPM. The study is useful not only for understanding the past and current state of maritime research, but also for developing a concrete foundation to discuss further development of MPM.",2013
"Neutron spectrometry and dosimetry study at two research nuclear reactors using Bonner sphere spectrometer (BSS), rotational spectrometer (ROSPEC) and cylindrical nested neutron spectrometer (NNS)",,RADIATION PROTECTION; CALIBRATION; ENERGIES; FIELDS,"Neutron spectrometry and subsequent dosimetry measurements were undertaken at the McMaster Nuclear Reactor (MNR) and AECL Chalk River National Research Universal (NRU) Reactor. The instruments used were a Bonner sphere spectrometer (BSS), a cylindrical nested neutron spectrometer (NNS) and a commercially available rotational proton recoil spectrometer. The purposes of these measurements were to: (1) compare the results obtained by three different neutron measuring instruments and (2) quantify neutron fields of interest. The results showed vastly different neutron spectral shapes for the two different reactors. This is not surprising, considering the type of the reactors and the locations where the measurements were performed. MNR is a heavily shielded light water moderated reactor, while NRU is a heavy water moderated reactor. The measurements at MNR were taken at the base of the reactor pool, where a large amount of water and concrete shielding is present, while measurements at NRU were taken at the top of the reactor (TOR) plate, where there is only heavy water and steel between the reactor core and the measuring instrument. As a result, a large component of the thermal neutron fluence was measured at MNR, while a negligible amount of thermal neutrons was measured at NRU. The neutron ambient dose rates at NRU TOR were measured to be between 0.03 and 0.06 mSv h(1), while at MNR, these values were between 0.07 and 2.8 mSv h(1) inside the beam port and 0.2 mSv h(1) between two operating beam ports. The conservative uncertainty of these values is 15 . The conservative uncertainty of the measured integral neutron fluence is 5 . It was also found that BSS over-responded slightly due to a non-calibrated response matrix.",2013
A finite element modelling to investigate the mitigation of blast effects on reinforced concrete panel using foam cladding,RC slab; Foam cladding; Blast mitigation; Blast testing,ALUMINUM FOAMS; COLUMNS; LOADS; BEAMS; SLABS,"Protection of critical infrastructure against bomb attacks due to the rising threat of terrorism requires more attention. An effective solution to mitigate blast effects on infrastructure is to protect them with cellular foam material cladding. This paper investigates the capabilities of metallic foam cladding, which can absorb a significantly high blast energy being a cellular solid, in protecting critical reinforced concrete slabs against blast loadings. A coupled cladding structure interaction model based on the finite element technique has been developed to quantify the interaction between the cladding and the reinforced concrete (RC) slab subjected to blast loads. As the RC slab is supported at its two opposite edges and other edges are free in the present investigation, the slab is idealised as a beam in the proposed model where the small localised regions subjected to high moments are referred to as hinged regions which are connected with the large remaining parts of the structure referred to as non-hinge regions. The foam cladding layer over the RC slab is modelled as a lumped mass spring system which considers deformation of the foam layer in the loading direction. The hinge regions of the beam are simulated with interface elements having rotational stiffness which is obtained from a moment rotation model. The foam is modelled by an array of lumped masses over each beam element node connected by a number of inelastic extensional springs in the loading direction which help to model the progressive densification of the foam layer. Meanwhile a series of blast tests have been carried out by the DSTO (Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Australia) at their blast testing site at Port Wakefield, South Australia to investigate the effectiveness of the foam protected RC slabs against blast loads. The data recorded from the blast tests have also been used for the validation of the coupled cladding structure interaction model. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013
Strain gauge measurements of the precast concrete lining of a shield-driven tunnel,Strain gauges; ovalisation; shield-driven tunnel; non-destructive testing; laser scanning; monitoring,,"One of the critical steps in the design process of a shield-driven tunnel is the correct identification of the loads acting on the precast concrete elements of the segmental lining. However, in tunnelling, determination of the loads during ring erection, advance of the tunnel boring machine, building-up of earth pressure and bedding of the articulated ring is difficult and very few monitoring results of actual tunnel behaviour at an early stage are available. Strain gauge measurements can constitute an important contribution in acquiring a better understanding of the real-time behaviour of the tunnel lining under numerous loading conditions, especially during construction. To achieve this, every aspect of the strain gauge installation process should be handled with the utmost care in order to cope with the rough site conditions and deliver accurate measurement results. This paper reports on the monitoring programme pursued in the Liefkenshoek rail tunnel, located in the Port of Antwerp. It details the practical implementation of the strain gauges and corresponding wireless data acquisitioning system, as well as the ovalisation measurement set-up using laser scanning. The collected measurement results serve as a perfect illustration of the achieved reliability and precision of the combined monitoring programme.",2013
Flexible soils amplified the damage in the 2010 Haiti earthquake,,WAVES,"On January 12th, 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter 15 km SW of the city of Port-au-Prince and a hypocenter at 10 km depth, caused 316,000 deaths, 350,000 injured people, and destroyed 300,000 homes that left 1,500,000 homeless. This is the worst global seismic tragedy of the past 50 years. All the collapsed buildings in Haiti were raised on soft and flexible clayey soils of bad seismic response, which were deposited on ancient marine channel. In comparison, the buildings raised on Tertiary limestone of the southern slope of the city suffered no damage. This includes the precariously built structures near the epicenter, which lacked any engineering design from the impoverished people who live on the rocky slopes. Buildings with apparently robust structures, and designed with engineering standards, such as the national palace, the cathedral and the Montana hotel, collapsed when the soft and flexible soils amplified the vibration and the seismic energy of the earthquake. This resulted in greater forces that produced wide lateral displacements at the higher levels of homes and buildings. These forces caused major shear deformations that exceeded the elastic limit of the concrete, leading to failure and the loss of many lives. Few architectural designs took seismic response into consideration when engineering building projects. The low shear-strength ( which may be related to low shear velocity) foundations of many locations were given no differential treatment, in comparison to locally more rigid rock foundations. These engineering deficiencies lead to more seismic disasters around the world.",2013
Jointless 'floating' deck for the Walt Whitman Bridge,,,"Due to water leakage at deck relief joints, the stringers and the top chord of the floor trusses were heavily corroded. The poor condition of the framing, coupled with the advanced age and the condition of the existing deck, resulted in the Delaware River Port Authority electing to replace the deck system in 2006. Several deck replacement options, including a steel orthotropic deck and a concrete-filled steel grid deck, were studied. The grid deck option was selected for its lower initial construction cost and the feasibility of making it jointless. To make the grid deck jointless in each span, it had to be either rigidly connected to the stiffening trusses through deck shear keys along the length of the span, or allowed to move freely, i.e. ""float"", relative to the stiffening trusses. The ""floating"" deck option was determined to be more economical and have better performance, thus advanced through final design and construction.",2013
The Effects of Ocean Salinity Variance due to Climate Change on Australian Seaport Infrastructure,chloride ingress; salinity; climate change; concrete; hydrological cycle,REINFORCED-CONCRETE; ENVIRONMENT,"As the effects of climatic change become more evident and extreme, there is significant pressure being mounted onto port authorities and infrastructure stakeholders to ensure that their assets are resilient to the effects of a more aggressive and corrosive climate. Typically, the reinforcing steel within concrete which provides its flexural strength is protected from corrosion by both the alkalinity of the cement and the distance of cover from the chloride laden environment. However, studies are suggesting that as the hydrological cycle around the equator begins to accelerate, the salinity of the oceans at these lower latitudes (namely from 25 degrees S to 25 degrees N) will increase. As demonstrated through Fick's 2nd Law of diffusion, there will then be an effect on the build-up of surface chlorides and thus, chloride ingress through the cement matrix to initiate corrosion. Through an extensive literature review of climatic forecasts, and both laboratory and infield trials, this paper will numerically demonstrate the relationship between salinity concentration and surface chloride levels at varying temperatures. The results illustrate a strong positive relationship between the two parameters suggesting faster corrosion initiation, and more frequent operational downtime for stakeholders into the future. To fill this gap in knowledge, the surface chloride equations presented should be considered when design, maintenance, and retrofitting options are being considered for stakeholders within the affected locations.",2013
A comparison of phase-shift and one-port coaxial cell permittivity measurements for GPR applications,permittivity characterisation; ground penetrating radar; phase-shift; coaxial cell; dielectric characterisation,GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; TRANSMISSION-LINES; ASPHALT PAVEMENT; CONCRETE; CALIBRATION; DESIGN,"The coarse and loose nature of unbound granular road materials presents a number of challenges for conventional permittivity characterisation approaches. An alternative that appears better suited to these materials involves measuring the phase-shift at discrete frequencies through a sample of known thickness. To validate this approach against more established methods, a comparison is required on materials that can be easily measured using either method. To this end phase-shift measurements were undertaken on a range of solid dielectric slabs including various types of stone, plastic and an artificial material. Permittivity predictions from this method were then compared to results from a one-port coaxial cell. As an additional comparison, and to better understand the results, the phase-shift test setup was also modelled using GPRMax software. To improve the predictions, reverberations within the test apparatus were minimized by isolating the direct wave using time-domain Blackman windowing. However, the narrow window necessary for this particular test setup also degraded the ability to detect frequency-dependent permittivity changes. Overall the phase-shift approach produced real relative permittivity predictions similar to that from the one-port coaxial cell. Despite limitations in the current approach, the results validate the phase-shift approach as a simple and rapid method of characterizing the permittivity of larger dielectric material samples of constant thickness.",2013

AutoQUEST provides the means to define testing techniques against an abstract Application Programming Interface (API) and provides plug-ins to port the testing techniques to distinct platforms. The requirements on plug-in implementations for AutoQUEST are kept low to keep the porting effort low. We implemented several testing techniques on top of AutoQUEST and provide five plug-ins for concrete software platforms, which demonstrates the capabililities of our approach.",2013
Optimization of High Concrete Retaining Wall Structure,pier high concrete retaining wall; structure form selection; optimization design; great height of water,,"The height of vertical pier retaining wall is relatively larger in regions with great height of water. As the retaining wall becomes higher, the cross-sectional area of ordinary gravity pier structure becomes larger and foundation strength needs to be larger, thus there are some restrictions for traditional structure form. This research focuses on new structure forms of high concrete retaining wall and its optimization design for piers in regions with great height of water. This study establishes a nonlinear constrained mathematical model of pier high retaining wall structures. The objective function is cross-sectional area of the pier retaining wall which is restricted by the stability, bearing capacity of foundation and strength of cross-section of retaining wall. This model is solved by fmincon function from Matlab and the results present an economically reasonable cross-section form. This new selection is greatly significant to improve the stability of high concrete retaining wall and reduce the project cost. The new structure is successfully used in a port of Huaihe River and it can be a solution to pier structure selection problem in regions with great height of water in the future.",2013
Complex 3D calculation models for shaft-bored tunnel connection applied to the Liefkenshoek railways tunnels project,,,"Located in Antwerp (Belgium), the Liefkenshoek project creates a direct connection from the port to the railway system for goods transport. 6kms of twin bored tunnels were excavated by using two Herrenknecht slurry pressure TBMs. Final lining is composed of 40cm precast reinforced concrete segments for an internal diameter of 7.30m. Eight rectangular evacuation shafts are linked to bored tunnels by galleries of very limited length, 50cm or 80cm depending on the shaft walls thickness. As classical reinforced concrete lining is not adapted to these so short dimensions, it was decided to include a steel portal in the concrete lining to support the segmental lining of tunnels at final stage. Considering the structure complexity, 3D Midas GTS models were used to check the feasibility of this concept and then to finalize the design.",2013
Probabilistic Modelling of the Deterioration of Reinforced Concrete Port Infrastructure,Concrete structures; corrosion; chloride induced corrosion,COVER-CRACKING; RC STRUCTURES; CORROSION; CHLORIDE; TIME,"Port infrastructure is vulnerable to the corrosive marine environment leading to deterioration, loss of functionality, delays in shipping, major maintenance, remediation and, in the worst cases, loss of structural integrity and consequent replacement of the asset. Despite this, asset managers are unable to adequately plan for the prevention and minimisation of maintenance due to a lack of reliable predictive tools, that simulate the deterioration and a lack of a lifecycle model incorporating protection/maintenance options. This paper reports on a project to develop such a tool to facilitate the probabilistic modelling of the deterioration of reinforced concrete elements from construction through onset of corrosion to subsequent cracking and spalling. The Australian government funded project is in collaboration with several port authorities. The study has narrowed the key factors that have the most impact on the estimation of corrosion initiation and damage propagation allowing better definition of what data should be collected, how much and levels of accuracy required to ensure that predictive outputs obtained are as 'robust' as possible.",2013

Passive climatization using a cool roof and natural ventilation for internally displaced persons in hot climates: Case study for Haiti,Low cost housing; Cool roof; Thermal comfort; Development cooperation; International energy policy,THERMAL COMFORT; ENERGY SAVINGS; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; REFLECTANCE; COATINGS; BENEFITS,"The 2010 Earthquake in Haiti caused catastrophic damage to the metropolitan area of Port au Prince. The earthquake destroyed approximately 105,000 homes, causing more than 2.3 million people to live as Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). Today, more than 1.3 million people still live in tents. Low cost buildings can provide a housing solution for these people. This paper proposes a low cost building solution intended for hot climates, using concrete as the only material. Due to the lack of facilities at these locations, no conventional energy or cooling systems can be installed; thus, only passive cooling technologies can be used to increase thermal comfort. A low cost cool roof and combined natural ventilation is proposed, and simulations show an improvement of 16% in the thermal conditions inside the building. The simulation is performed using the software package EnergyPlus and shows that cool roofs can be a good solution for improving living conditions in low cost houses for IDPs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Anti-Colonialism and Social Science: Georges Balandier, Madeira Keita, and ""the Colonial Situation"" in French Africa",,,"Two young men met on a quay at the port in Conakry, Guinea in 1946. One, waiting dockside, was Mamadou Madeira Keita, a low-level civil servant and archivist. Years later, when he was a political prisoner in the Malian Sahara, some would argue that he was ""the first francophone African ethnographer."" The other, descending the gangplank, was the Frenchman Keita had come to meet. Georges Balandier was unknown then, but would soon become a leading figure in the fields of sociology and anthropology. The encounter between Keita and Balandier was foundational for both men. Conakry incubated a canonical intervention-Balandier's 1951 article ""La Situation Coloniale""-that some attribute an ancestral role in a particular francophone tradition of post-colonial thought. Conakry, and Guinea at large, was also the crucible in which a powerful anti-colonial politics were forged by Madeira Keita and his allies. In this particular corner of West Africa, anti-colonial politics and an emergent, politically engaged social science conditioned each other, like the two strands of a double helix, each a necessary yet ultimately contingent element of the other's structure. Though these links did not last long, they had important effects. This article, by emphasizing the contingencies of the two men's intertwined biographies, seeks to carry out Balandier's dictate to emphasize the ""concrete"" nature of this particular situation in order to understand how and why anti-colonial politics and an innovative sociology converged and ultimately diverged.",2013
Design and optimization of maintenance strategies for a long life-span port project,Port structures; Maintenance planning; Chloride penetration; Monte-Carlo simulation; Cost analysis,MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; CYCLE COST; CONCRETE; ENVIRONMENT; SAFETY,"This paper deals with design and optimization of the maintenance works of reinforced concrete (RC) elements in a long life-span marine port in Shanghai, China. The deterioration model is established for the RC elements with prescribed durability limit state, and the failure probability evolution is calculated through Monte-Carlo simulations. Three maintenance levels are prescribed by failure probabilities at intervention. The preventive, necessary and mandatory maintenances correspond respectively to probability levels of 2, 5 and 20 %. Hereafter the cost model is built for the maintenance works of the port structure. With these available models, three schemes of maintenance planning are investigated: unsynchronized, synchronized and coating-synchronized schemes. For each scheme, all the three maintenance levels are considered. The cost analysis shows that the coating-synchronized scheme achieves the optimal cost by using surface coating to delay the deterioration rate of beam elements, and the necessary maintenance (Level 2) has always the lowest cost for all maintenance schemes. The coating-synchronized scheme with Level 2 maintenance is thus retained for the maintenance planning for RC elements in the marine port.",2013
Community Service Driven Student Senior Project and back to Community for Implementation,,,"After the devastating earthquake of January 2010 destroyed most of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and killed hundreds of thousands of people, many international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) descended on the Caribbean island nation to help not only in search and rescue but also in the reconstruction. The author took with him three architectural engineering (ARCE) undergraduate students from California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) to Haiti to help in the reconstruction efforts for one week. The students were so much motivated to volunteer their services to the community that three summer internships were organized for the students through one of the many NGOs in Haiti. The students spent most of the summer out in the community and were able to focus on what the community was lacking in order to move forward with safe repairs of damaged buildings and construction of new safe and sustainable earthquake resistant buildings. By the end of the summer internships, two of the students had each identified a problem that needed to be addressed which in turn became their respective senior projects. This paper reports on the two senior projects that were driven by the community service. The scope of the first project was to manufacture and test applicability of a device that may be used to accurately determine the compressive strength of concrete masonry block in the field. The device had to be easy to transport, easy to use for unskilled operators and was able to give test results on the spot that were easy to interpret. The second project's scope was to design and test a training device for building professionals to demonstrate the behavior of confined masonry buildings under a cyclic (earthquake) loading. Simulation of earthquake loading by shaking the table and removal of some building elements made it easier to communicate the design concepts during the trainings. Upon graduation, the two students were offered employment by two different NGOs in Haiti where they are currently implementing the results of their senior projects back in the community.",2013
An Advanced Approach for Port Detection Based on Scanning Radar,port detection; LFMCW radar; time-frequency distribution,,"In this paper, we present an advanced approach for port detection based on scanning radar. Linear Frequency Modulation Continuous Wave (LFMCW) radar is chosen for port detection because of the characteristic of quasi-optical, the ability of almost all-weather employment and short-range high resolution. But angular resolution of LFMCW radar is limited by the antenna aperture size and wavelength. In order to obtain better angular resolution, scanning antenna and deconvolution is first adopted in LFMCW radar. The echo signal model of scanning antenna and principle of deconvolution are also analyzed in this paper. Furthermore, time-frequency distribution (TFD) is adopted in echo signal to obtain more movement information of ships. At the end of this paper, concrete steps of port detection are described by the use of deconvolution methods and time-frequency analysis. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the advanced approach.",2013
CASE STUDY OF TSUNAMI BORE IMPACT ON RC WALL,,VERTICAL WALL; FORCES,"The Tohoku Tsunami of March 11, 2011 caused tremendous damage to many coastal buildings, bridges and port facilities. During field surveys following this event, the authors documented a number of structures that were damaged to a near-collapse condition as a result of hydrodynamic loading. Analysis of survivor videos provided information on the tsunami flow characteristics at these locations, allowing for an assessment of current hydrodynamic loading expressions under full-scale conditions. Based on laboratory experiments performed at Oregon State University, the lead author and colleagues developed a new hydrodynamic loading expression for a broken bore striking a vertical wall [1]. This expression was applied to a case study of a large vertical reinforced concrete (RC) wall damaged by an incoming bore strike during the Toholcu Tsunami. The damaged wall is on the seaward side of a high-bay building in the Minami Gamou Sewage Treatment plant near the Sendai coastline. A non-linear finite element model of the building was subjected to the hydrodynamic pressure distribution derived from the laboratory experiments. It is shown by structural analysis of the wall that using this loading expression generates the same yielding response in the wall as observed in the field, as reflected in the deflected shape measured by LiDAR. Similar analysis using current Japan Tsunami design provisions indicates that these provisions are considerably more conservative from a structural perspective than is necessary to resist hydrodynamic loading from a tsunami bore. This paper presents the application of hydrodynamic loading by the leading edge of a bore, determined based on laboratory experiments, to the non-linear analysis of a reinforced concrete building damaged during the Toholcu Tsunami.",2013
Influence of the Lithuanian Sea Industry on Natural Environment Biodiversity of Smelte Peninsula,Lithuanian sea industry; rare plant species; preservation of the genetic fund,,"Intensive industrialisation of the Smele peninsula, the pollution of the Northern part of the Curonians lagoon, increasing with each year. Recreation activities on the coastal meadows - it is the main harmful factors for the flora, especially for rare and vanishing populations of plants as Glaux maritima, Aster tripolium, Triglochin maritimum, Juncus gerardii, included into Red Data book of Lithuanian. The construction of the Ferry port (Klaipeda - Mukran) in the Nother part of the Smelte peninsula has been covered with concrete about ten hectares meadows and the terminal for huge sea ferries have been established as well. For these reasons, this rare plant species have vanished irrevocably from the territory of the Smelte peninsula. Latter decade, the industrialization of the Smelte peninsula has been renewed, the construction of the sea container terminal has been in progress. Concrete covering has covered a big part of the Smelte peninsula territory. Only a part of the Smelte peninsula has not yet been covered with concrete. So this remaining part of the territory currently is the only place where in Lithuania can detect such rare species as: Aster tripolium L., Glaux maritima L., Triglochin maritimum L., Juncun gerardii Laisel. Purposes of the study were determining the dynamics of plant species populations; determine rare plants species state and conditions of growth in the inventory habitat (from 1988 till 2012). For these research of the anthropogenic influence on the plants habitats and determination of abundance of rare plants population, was used itinerary investigation method. The Smelte peninsula biodiversity has been measured and investigated by using various routes and objectives of estimation. The floral has been estimated on the circular record plots with the diameter of 4 meters. Intensive industrialization of Smelte peninsula is evidently harmful for the flora which growing on this area, especially for the population of rare and vanishing plants species. In recent twenty five years (1988 - 2012) the number of individuals in the population of Glaux maritima, has dimished by 70 %, Aster tripolium - by 80%, Triglochin maritimum - by 95% and Juncus gerardii as well as 90%. Abundance of population and the territory of the habitats evidently decreased because the sea industry developed on the Smelte peninsula. Preservation of genetic fund of the Lithuanian flora should be strengthened based on scientific recommendations.",2013

For this purpose, tests introducing two electromagnetic methods (GPR and the capacitive technique), as well as the impact-echo method, were run on six different concrete mixes containing various porosities, with five water content values and three chloride concentrations. A reinforced concrete beam, extracted from the wharf of the Nantes-Saint-Nazaire Port, exposed to ocean tides was also tested under actual conditions. The NDT laboratory results exhibit linear correlations with concrete indicators, which in turn allows building a three-dimensional empirical model. This 3D cross-correlation model, coupled with onsite NDT results, is then used to perform a durability diagnosis of the actual structure. Moreover, these results serve to illustrate the advantages of the 2D data fusion models developed during this project. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012

The water within concrete pores or cracks has a great influence on the macroscopic mechanical properties of concrete, especially its global modulus of elasticity and strength. The present study investigates the quantitative influence of water content, i.e. concrete porosity, on the global mechanical properties of saturated concrete. By a three-phase spherical model and a hollow cylindrical rod model, the effect of porosity on the effective bulk and shear moduli of saturated concrete is studied in a quantitative manner. Based on the assumption that the pore-water has no shear capacity, the effective elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of the saturated concrete are obtained using the theory of elasticity subsequently. Furthermore, according to the maximum tensile stress failure criterion, the quantitative relationships between the porosity and the global tensile strengths as well as their corresponding tensile peak strains of concrete in dry and saturated states are established. Finally, a comparison between the theoretical results and experimental data is made to verify the rationality and the accuracy of the present approach. The present results are comparable to the experimental observations of Yaman et al. [4,23], indicating that the present approach is applicable to predict the effective mechanical properties of concrete in both dry and saturated states. Moreover, it is found that compared with dry concrete, the water within saturated pores limits the surrounding concrete matrix deforming into pores, causing the enhancement of the global elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio of concrete. The effect of pore-water on concrete tensile strength is significant and should not be neglected in design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012
2012 Frank Newman Speller Award: Cathodic Protection of Offshore Structures-History and Current Status,calcareous coating; cathodic protection; corrosion; deep water; dual nodes; galvanic anodes; retrofit; seawater; slope parameter; unified design equation,SACRIFICIAL ANODE; CURRENT-DENSITY; CALCAREOUS DEPOSITS; PART 2; SEAWATER; DESIGN; STEEL; POLARIZATION; WATER; TEMPERATURE,"Categories of marine structures that use cathodic protection (CP) include port and harbor facilities, ships, coastal reinforced concrete bridges, pipelines, and those used for petroleum production. Primary focus of the present paper was on the last of these (offshore petroleum production structures) and CP theory and practice advances that have been made during the past several decades. Because of structure size, carbon or high-strength steel is the most common material of construction. The inception studies by Davy almost 200 years ago are reviewed briefly, followed by a review of subsequent CP evolvement and application. CP has been the primary corrosion control methodology for the submerged portion of offshore structures and pipelines for the past 60-plus years. Until the last several decades, however, improvements in marine CP design were incremental and based largely upon trial and error and empirical algorithms. These include the earlier single and subsequent triplicate design current density methods, which are reviewed. Also addressed are the recently developed first-principles-based slope parameter and unified design equation concepts, which require but a single design current density. Importance of the specified design current density, as affected by environmental conditions and calcareous deposits, is emphasized. Special topics, including deep water applications and design of retrofit systems, are discussed.",2012
"Early detection of potentially invasive invertebrate species in Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819 dominated communities in harbours",Constanta harbour; Black Sea; Invertebrates; Alien species; Recolonization; Monitoring,RAPID ASSESSMENT SURVEY; BLACK-SEA; POPULATION-SIZE; RICHNESS; INVASIBILITY; HABITATS; BIODIVERSITY; DIVERSITY; MARINAS; MODEL,"ConstanA a pound harbour is a major port on the western coast of the semi-enclosed Black Sea. Its brackish waters and low species richness make it vulnerable to invasions. The intensive maritime traffic through ConstanA a pound harbour facilitates the arrival of alien species. We investigated the species composition of the mussel beds on vertical artificial concrete substrate inside the harbour. We selected this habitat for study because it is frequently affected by fluctuating levels of temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen, and by accidental pollution episodes. The shallow communities inhabiting it are thus unstable and often restructured, prone to accept alien species. Monthly samples were collected from three locations from the upper layer of hard artificial substrata (maximum depth 2 m) during two consecutive years. Ten alien macro-invertebrate species were inventoried, representing 13.5% of the total number of species. Two of these alien species were sampled starting the end of summer 2010, following a period of high temperatures that triggered hypoxia, causing mass mortalities of benthic organisms. Based on the species accumulation curve, we estimated that we have detected all benthic alien species on artificial substrate from ConstanA a pound harbour, but additional effort is required to detect all the native species. Our results suggest that monitoring of benthic communities at small depths in harbours is a simple and useful tool in early detection of potentially invasive alien species. The selected habitat is easily accessible, the method is low-cost, and the samples represent reliable indicators of alien species establishment.",2012

The second (Christchurch) earthquake (M-w = 6.2) on 22 February 2011, caused by a thrust fault, affected the same region. Both earthquakes caused extensive liquefaction, associated ground deformation and severe damage to residential houses and utilities while instability occurred on the Port Hills. In this study, observations by the authors at different parts of the earthquake-affected region after both earthquakes are described, analyzed and discussed. The grain-size distribution of the liquefied soils shows a good agreement with empirical bounds of liquefiable soils. In addition, comparisons of the observations with the empirical relations linking the earthquake magnitude and liquefaction limit distance, show good agreement. The factors of safety against liquefaction are very low when computed by three different techniques using the data from available geotechnical boreholes. Good correlations are obtained between the displacements due to lateral spreading and those estimated from the aerial photogrammetry method, and between the observations with empirical magnitude and epicentral limit distance relations for coherent and disrupted slopes. Estimations using an empirical relation proposed by the authors are compared with lateral spreading and it is concluded that the thickness of liquefiable layers ranges between 4 and 8 m. As the houses and suburban buildings were light, the effect of liquefaction and lateral spreading caused severe damage but not collapse. However, heavy concrete structures settled and tilted and empty buried tanks floated. It is of note that these two earthquakes and major aftershocks greater than magnitude 5 showed that the same areas could liquefy multiple times if the conditions for liquefaction are satisfied.",2012
Assessment of Long-Term Performance of a 50-Year-Old Jetty in the South of Iran,Chloride; Concrete durability; Corrosion; Jetty; Long-term performance; Structure assessment,CONCRETE STRUCTURES; MARINE-ENVIRONMENT; CORROSION DAMAGE; CARBONATION; FRP,"A detailed investigation was carried out on a 50-year-old reinforced concrete jetty in a commercial port of Iran to assess the long-term performance as well as the structural condition. Destructive and nondestructive tests such as carbonation depth, electrical resistivity, chloride diffusion, X-ray diffraction, compressive strength, and water absorption were performed. The results revealed that the good quality of the concrete has protected reinforcement from corrosion. However, structural analysis showed minor weakness in some elements of the jetty; thus, consulting engineers finally decided to strengthen some elements with fiber-reinforced polymers.

Are native Saccostrea glomerata and invasive Crassostrea gigas oysters' habitat equivalents for epibenthic communities in south-eastern Australia?,Aquaculture; Ecosystem engineers; Habitat complexity; Pacific oyster; Sydney rock oyster,ESTUARINE FOULING ASSEMBLAGE; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; QX DISEASE; INTERTIDAL ASSEMBLAGES; HAWKESBURY RIVER; PORT STEPHENS; ROCKY SHORES; COMPLEXITY; SYDNEY; REEFS,"Introduced species that-alter the physical structure of marine habitats can have large impacts on biodiversity. We assessed whether in south-eastern Australia the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, differs from the native Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, in the biogenic habitat that it provides to epibiotic communities. We also assessed how within a species (S. glomerata), genotype influences habitat provision. First, we conducted a field experiment in which we compared recruitment of epibiota to concrete plates with either C. gigas, wild-stock S. glomerata, selectively bred S. glomerata or glue (control). Second, we assessed whether within wild S. glomerata populations invaded by C. gigas, communities of epibenthos are correlated to the ratio of non-native to native oysters. On experimental plates C. gigas grew larger, and experienced higher mortality than both selectively-bred and wild-stock S. glomerata at each of two heights on the shore. The two genotypes of S. glomerata, by contrast, displayed similar rates of growth and mortality. The differing growth patterns among oyster types had not, however, translated to consistent differences in the composition of associated benthic communities by 12 months following establishment of experimental treatments. Within established wild oyster assemblages, C. gigas were typically much larger than on our experimental plates, and the non-native influenced the abundance of several epibiotic taxa, although not the identity of species present Where impacts of C. gigas on the abundance of associated benthic species occurred, they were generally negative. Overall, our results indicate that while differences in the population size-structure of C. gigas and S. glomerata may be evident from small-scale experiments, the detection of flow-on effects to associated epibenthic communities may require approaches that incorporate much larger spatio-temporal scales. Nevertheless, the observation that wild C. gigas primarily influenced the abundance rather than the identity of associated epifauna suggests a certain degree of redundancy between the two species in their provision of habitat to epibiota.

DAMAGE CHARACTERISTIC AND FIELD SURVEY OF THE 2011 GREAT EAST JAPAN TSUNAMI IN MIYAGI PREFECTURE,The 2011 Great East Japan tsunami; field survey; Miyagi prefecture,,"On March 11th, 2011, the Pacific coast of Japan was hit by a tsunami generated by the largest earthquake (M9.0) in the history of the country and causing a wide range of devastating damage. Using preliminary reported data from many sources, some topics such as tsunami fatality ratio and tsunami fragility curves for structural damage are discussed and compared with other countries. This paper aims to discuss the damage characteristics of this tsunami as well as its mechanism, as observed through field surveys conducted over the 4 months following the tsunami. The field survey covers 13 areas in the Miyagi prefecture from Kesennuma city in the northernmost region to Yamamoto town in the southernmost region. The arrival time of the first tsunami along the coastal areas in the Miyagi prefecture was confirmed by stopped clocks found during the survey. The damage mechanism of coastal structures such as breakwaters, seawalls, tsunami gates, and evacuation buildings was investigated and discussed. Damage characteristics for each area, i.e., urban areas, port, coastal structures, fisheries, and agricultural areas, were also summarized. The conclusions drawn from the data analysis suggest that experience and education (soft countermeasures) are important to reduce the loss of life, as shown for example in the Sanriku area. The field surveys indicate that wood and reinforced-concrete (RC) structures should be balanced to survive both earthquake and tsunami forces, and the structural design for buildings should be reconsidered after the example in Onagawa town. In addition, coastal structures for tsunami countermeasures (hard countermeasures) should be more properly designed for survival instead of becoming floating debris upon being overturned by a tsunami. The combination of both hard and soft measures is especially necessary for optimizing the outcomes following a great disaster. These recommendations should be taken into consideration in the reconstruction efforts for better tsunami countermeasures in the future.",2012

Australian Seaport Infrastructure Resilience to Climate Change,seaport; climate change; concrete; deterioration,CONCRETE; CARBONATION,"A research project continuing at RMIT University is exploring the resilience of port structures in a changing climate. Research completed to date comprises of identifying types of port infrastructure vulnerable to climate change, establishing materials and exposure conditions, developing deterioration models based on current knowledge to simulate the effect of climate change on key port infrastructure and modeling the selected elements of infrastructure to derive outcomes which will aid in decision making in port infrastructure management. A considerable effort has been concentrated on identifying input climate data most appropriate for the models developed. The modeling approach is presented in this paper for quantitative projections of damage probability on port infrastructure taking into account the variability of material type, design considerations and environmental exposures with a changing climate. This paper provides a summary of the research undertaken in the development of material deterioration models and their responses to a changing climate load. Using climate information drawn from historical weather records and future climate projections, existing deterioration models were refined to include climate data into modeling runs in order to analyze changes to deterioration rates of different materials when impacted by a change in climate variables. Outputs from this modeling process will assist port authorities in making informed decisions on maintenance and capital budget planning allowing for impacts of climate change.",2012
Three-dimension diagnostic methods of quay wall using focusing acoustic parametric probe and imaging sonar,multi-beam echo sounder; Shape of the quay wall; Inner air hole,,"Collapse and subsidence of quay wall at a harbor are often reported and a diagnosis method to prevent the accident has become a significant concern. To achieve the more accurate assessment of quay wall, we try to develop the new diagnosis method which enables to estimate the inside and outside state of the quay wall from the underwater site. In this study, the outside mapping of the quay wall was conducted using multi-beam echo sounder, and the focusing acoustic parametric probe was developed for the detection of the air hole inside the quay wall. Outside mapping was performed at the port in Chiba. Three-dimensional image of the quay wall was reconstructed from the bathymetry data and seafloor topographys, and the mean tilt angle of quay wall was quantified. The sediments and tilted quay wall were clearly seen in this experiment. The acoustic characteristic of the probe, which was developed for the inner air hole detection, were evaluated in the experimental aquarium using three transmission signals [Summing1, 2 and linear frequency modulation signals (LFM)].

Composite material pedestrian bridge for the Port of Bilbao,,,"Composite materials in comparison to traditional ones, steel and concrete, present advantages in civil works construction: lower weight, higher corrosion resistance (especially in the marine environment), and ease of installation. On the other hand, fabrication costs are generally higher. This is the reason why this technology is not widely used. This work illustrates the process followed for the design, fabrication and installation of a composite material pedestrian bridge in the Port of Bilbao (Northern Spain). In order to reduce the price of the bridge, the use of low cost materials was considered, therefore polyester resin was selected as the polymeric matrix, and glass fibres as reinforcement. Two material choices were studied. Currently in the market there is high availability of carbon nanoparticles: carbon nanotubes (CNT) and carbon nanofibres (CNF), so it was decided to add this kind of nanoparticles to the reference material with the objective of improving its mechanical properties. The main challenge was to transfer the CNT and CNF excellent properties to the polymeric matrix. This requires dispersing the nanoreinforcements as individual particles in the polymeric matrix to avoid agglomerates. For this reason, an advanced high shear forces dispersion technique (called ""three roll mills"") was studied and implemented. Also surface functionalization of the nanoreinforcements by chemical treatment was carried out. Herein, a comparison is performed between both materials studied, the explanation of the employment of the reference material (without nanoreinforcement) as the one used in the fabrication of the pedestrian bridge is justified and, finally, the main characteristics of the final design of the structural element are described.",2012

To this end, we draw on an analysis of the economic- and urban-geographical tenets of advanced producer service (APS) procurement based on a survey and semi-structured interviews with managers from automobile companies located in the port of Ghent (Belgium). Our analysis suggests that three dimensions are of prime interest: (i) a functional dimension focusing on APS firms' influence on managerial and/or operational capabilities; (ii) a governance dimension focusing on APS firms' ability to influence wider geographical patterns; and (iii) a concrete spatial dimension focusing on the geography of APS procurement. In this paper, we primarily deal with the spatial dimension. Our analysis suggests that the intra-firm allocation of decision-making power as regards service procurement is a key vatiable when accounting for the urban APS geographies.

Mechanical and durability properties of concrete made with dredged marine sand,Dredged marine sand; Volume of permeable pores; Mechanical properties; Durability properties,FINE AGGREGATE; SEDIMENTS; PERMEABILITY; STRENGTH; HARBOR,"The process of depletion of sources of natural aggregates challenges the production of technically and environmentally adequate concrete. Alternative material from marine sources, especially for concrete maritime structures, could represent an acceptable solution for this problem and it might also be of great interest for port management. This research work describes the study of the mechanical and durability properties of concretes fabricated with dredged marine sand (DMS) as a fine granular corrector in partial substitution of raw sand (from 15% to up to 50% by raw sand mass) designed for harbor pavements. Three DMS samples were extracted from the Port of Barcelona. The material was stockpiled in the open air and no washing, drying or decontamination process was carried out. Mineralogical, physical and chemical properties of DMS material were determined. Eight different mixtures were produced incorporating three types of DMS material as granular corrector in partial substitution of crushed limestone raw sand. The concretes were submitted to compressive strength tests after 7 and 28 days of moist curing, as well as density, absorption, accessible pores, elastic modulus, tensile and splitting tensile strength, abrasion, capillary suction, water penetration under pressure and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) tests, all of them after 28 days of moist curing. This study shows that dredged marine sand can be successfully used as a fine aggregate for concrete production. This is justified by the similar physical and mechanical properties of concrete made with DMS comparing to reference concrete. It was verified that the use of DMS in substitution of raw sand maintained or reduced the accessible pores, the sorptivity and the water penetration depth under pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

ITER lower port systems integration,ITER; Port systems; Integration divertor diagnostics cryopumps fuelling,,"The lower port systems are installed inside the vacuum vessel lower ports and in the adjacent port cells. The vacuum vessel ports and penetrations are allocated as follow: - 4 ports dedicated to remote handling of the divertor cassettes, contain diagnostics racks and divertor cooling pipes. - 5 ports connecting the main vessel to the torus cryopumps, contain divertor cooling pipes, pellet and gas injection pipes and vertical stabilization coil feeders. - 3 penetrations connecting torus cryopumps are connected to the vacuum vessel by branch pipes. - Specific penetrations for divertor cooling lines, in-vessel viewing and glow discharge systems. The general layout of the port systems has been revised recently to improve the cryopump (8 t weight, 1.8 m diameter and 2.5 m long) maintenance scheme with remote handling tools and integrate the in-vessel vertical stabilization coil feeders. The port allocation, the pumping ports design, and interfaces in-between ports and cryostat and in-between cryopumps and cryostat have been up-dated. The integration inside the 18 port cells (11 m x 4 m each) has been reviewed to avoid clashes in between systems and to fix the openings in the port cell concrete walls. The new layout integrates safety and neutron-shielding requirements as well as remote handling and maintenance compatibility for the different systems.

Measures of the Seismic Vulnerability of Reinforced Concrete Buildings in Haiti,earthquake engineering; reinforced concrete; structural engineering; walls,EARTHQUAKES; TURKEY,"Following the 12 January 2010 Haiti earthquake, teams of students and faculty members from the United States and Haiti surveyed 170 reinforced concrete (RC) buildings in Port-au-Prince and Leacuteogacircumflexne. This paper summarizes the survey results and compares them with results from a similar survey done after the 1999 earthquakes near Duumlzce, Turkey. The survey results demonstrate that the frequency of damage in RC buildings was higher in Haiti than in Turkey. This increased level of damage is consistent with practical screening criteria based on cross-sectional areas of building columns and walls. Based on these criteria, 90% of the structures surveyed in Haiti would have been classified as seismically vulnerable before the earthquake. Damage was more frequent in structures with captive columns. A two-tiered screening process is suggested to rapidly assess the vulnerability of scores of poorly built low-rise RC buildings in future earthquakes. [DOI:10.1193/1.3637034]",2011

Building Extraction and Rubble Mapping for City Port-au-Prince Post-2010 Earthquake with GeoEye-1 Imagery and Lidar Data,,COVER CLASSIFICATION; OBJECT,"This paper uses GeoEye-1 imagery and airborne lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) data to map buildings and their rubble in Port-au-Prince caused by the Haiti earthquake on 12 January 2010. This is achieved by performing an object-based one-class-at-a-time land cover classification of the image and lidar data using spectral, textural and height information. Classification accuracy is about 87 percent overall, and approximately 80 percent for buildings and rubble. Comparison of manually-selected 200 actual damaged buildings within an area of two sq. km in the city center shows an accuracy of over 90 percent for building and rubble mapping. 3D building models for approximately 55,000 buildings covering an area of 30 sq. km over Port-au-Prince were generated. It is found that most of the damage is to the concrete and masonry structures in the well planned areas of the city and very little damage to the shelters and the temporary type houses with metal sheet roofs. The study demonstrates that fusing optical imagery and lidar data can effectively map the nature, severity, extent and damage patterns caused by earthquakes in densely populated urban areas like Port-au-Prince.",2011

First, we surveyed the distribution of ephyrae of A. aurita s.l. at 75 stations encompassing the whole of Mikawa Bay in early 2008. A total of 37 ephyrae were sampled mostly from fishing ports. Ephyrae were most abundant around the islands located near the mouth of the bay, and decreased from the western part to the eastern part of Mikawa Bay. Next, we selected five fishing ports in Mikawa Bay where ephyrae occurred and surveyed the underside of floating piers and underwater overhangs of wharfs. We found dense colonies of polyps of A. aurita s.l. under nearly all of the floating piers at the two islands located near the mouth of the bay. Fitting a logistic regression model to the dataset showed that the percentage coverage of Aurelia polyps was significantly greater at the two islands compared with the other locations. In addition, the coverage of Aurelia polyps was greater when the coverage of other fouling organisms was in the range of 65-90%, and the coverage of Aurelia polyps was lower on floating piers with a vinyl surface and on concrete wharfs. The combined distribution of polyp colonies of A. aurita s.l. in Ise Bay and Mikawa Bay suggested that A. aurita s.l. in the two bays probably forms a single population and shoals of medusae mainly originate from protected harbors along the mouth-part of the bays.",2011
A new method for assessing CO2-emissions from container terminals: a promising approach applied in Rotterdam,Container terminals; CO2-emissions; Methodology,EMISSIONS; TRANSPORT,"At present, the notion is generally accepted that societies have to combat climate change. The reduction of CO2-emissions, an important cause for global warming, has become a priority, and consequently there is increasing pressure on governments and industries to come forward with initiatives to reduce CO2-emissions. This is highly relevant for the transport sector, as the share of transportation is still increasing, while other sectors are reducing their CO2-footprint. The main purpose of this paper is to present a methodology to analyse the CO2-emissions from container terminals, illustrated by the Port of Rotterdam. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the development of a methodology to analyse and gain a better understanding of the CO2-emissions by container terminals in port areas is described. Secondly, the most effective solutions to reduce CO2-emissions by container terminals in port areas are identified. The study provides insight into the processes of container transshipment at the terminals and the contribution of these processes to the CO2-emissions of the container terminals. Using these insights, potential solutions to reduce the CO2 at the terminals are identified and policy proposals are made for the operators of existing terminals and for governments. The most effective measure for CO2 reduction is undoubtedly the adaptation of the terminal layout as in the example of the Rotterdam Shortsea Terminal. This makes it possible to reduce the CO2-emissions of the current terminals by nearly 70 per cent. The other perspective is the incorporation of mixing 30 per cent biofuels with the presently used diesel. This results in a reduction of CO2-emissions by between 13 and 26 per cent per terminal and a reduction of the emissions of the total container sector by 21 per cent. On the basis of these findings, concrete recommendations are made to reducing CO2-emissions at container terminals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011
Assessment of Seismic Performance of Two Pile-Deck Wharf Connections,Connections; Piles; Seismic assessment; Structural testing; Wharves (harbors),,"This paper examines the seismic response of two full-scale pile-to-deck connections of marginal wharves built in the 1980s at the Port of Los Angeles. The first test represented a precast pretensioned concrete pile-deck connection at Berth 145. This berth required extending the deck for a new crane rail and a new line of piles. The proposed wharf upgrade considered leaving the existing piles if their lateral displacement capacity exceeded the expected seismic demands. A representative connection was tested to assess the rotation capacity under reversed cyclic loading. The second test represented a typical steel pile-deck connection used in Berth 226. In this structure, the piles support a crane rail. A reversed cyclic loading test was also conducted to assess the connection deformation capacity. Both connections were able to carry the imposed axial load throughout, even when the flexural strength had degraded.

Imperial Sugar Refinery Combustible Dust Explosion Investigation,combustible dust; sugar dust; dust explosion; NFPA 654; NFPA 499; Chemical Safety Board,,"On February 7, 2008, at about 7:15 p.m., a series of sugar dust explosions at the Imperial Sugar manufacturing facility in Port Wentworth, GA, resulted in 14 worker fatalities. Thirty-six workers were treated for serious burns and injuries some caused permanent, lye-altering conditions. The explosions and subsequent fires destroyed the sugar packing buildings, palletizer room, and silos, and severely damaged the bulk train car loading area and parts of the sugar refining process areas. The Imperial Sugar manufacturing facility housed a refinery that converts raw cane sugar into granulated sugar A system of screw and belt conveyors and bucket elevators transported granulated sugar from the refinery to three 105-foot tall sugar storage silos. Granulated sugar was then transported through conveyors and bucket elevators to specialty sugar processing areas and granulated sugar packaging machines. Sugar products were packaged in a four-story building surrounding the silos that contained packaging machines for the sugar products. Granulated sugar was also bulk shipped in railcars and tanker trucks in the bulk sugar loading area. The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) determined that the first dust explosion occurred in the enclosed steel belt conveyor located below the sugar silos. Steel cover panels installed on the belt conveyor less than a year before the explosion allowed explosive concentrations of sugar dust to accumulate inside the enclosure. An unknown source ignited the sugar dust, causing a violent explosion. The explosion lofted sugar dust that had accumulated on the floors and elevated horizontal surfaces, propagating more dust explosions through the buildings. Secondary dust explosions occurred throughout the packing buildings, parts of the refinery, and the bulk sugar loading buildings. The pressure waves from the explosions heaved thick concrete floors and collapsed brick walls, blocking stairwell and other exit routes. The resulting fires destroyed the packing buildings, silos, palletizer building and heavily damaged pans of the refinery and bulk sugar loading area. The CSB investigation identified the following incident causes: 1. Sugar and cornstarch conveying equipment was not designed or maintained to minimize the release of sugar and sugar dust into the work area. 2. Inadequate housekeeping practices resulted in significant accumulations of combustible granulated and powdered sugar and combustible sugar dust on the floors and elevated surfaces throughout the packing buildings. 3. Airborne combustible sugar dust accumulated above the minimum explosible concentration inside the newly enclosed steel belt assembly under silos 1 and 2. 4. An overheated bearing in the steel belt conveyor most likely ignited a primary dust explosion. 5. The primary dust explosion inside the enclosed steel conveyor belt under silos 1 and 2 triggered massive secondary dust explosions and fires throughout the packing buildings. 6. Accumulated sugar dust and spilled sugar fueled the secondary explosions and fires. All 14 fatalities were the result of these secondary events. This article presents the CSB investigation and discusses important management practices to prevent similar combustible dust explosions.

Performance Evaluation of Whitetopping and Ultrathin Whitetopping Pavements,,,"Whitetopping overlay is a relatively new rehabilitation technology as an alternative to hot-mix asphalt (HMA) overlay. It is defined as a port. land cement concrete (PCC) overlay on the existing deteriorated HMA pavement to improve the structural and functional capability. When the PCC overlay thickness is less than or equal to 10.16 cm (4 in.), it is referred to as ultrathin whitetopping (UTW). Otherwise it is referred to as normal whitetopping (WT). The objective of this research is to evaluate the performance of in-service whitetopping pavements as a rehabilitation technology by means of a pavement distress survey and falling weight deflectometer test. The performance of whitetopping pavements was characterized by the pavement condition index and pavement distress index. Statistical analysis of the performance was conducted in regard to major factors. Slab thickness, slab size, and pavement age were found to have a significant effect on the performance. The critical distance method and the MODCOMP6 program were applied in this study to backcalculate the layer properties of UTW and WT, respectively. KENSLAB was used to determine pavement response for fatigue analysis.",2011
Efficiency analysis to reflection of a new quay wall type,Harbour tranquillity; laboratory test; NOREF block; perforated quay wall; wave dissipation; wave reflection,PERFORATED BREAKWATER; WAVE INTERACTION; DESIGN,"The effective dissipation of residual wave energy inside a harbour basin is desirable to improve its tranquillity conditions and the efficiency of port operations. The construction of gentle slopes is frequently unfeasible due to space limitations and physical constraints. Hence, other solutions such as quay walls with a perforated (dissipative) berthing face are used. This research analyses the efficiency to reflection of an innovative type of structure consisting of the superposition of unreinforced concrete blocks, with an original geometry. Physical model tests were conducted at a scale of 1/30 for irregular long-crested waves normal to the quay wall, and the results indicated that reflection can be reduced, particularly for small peak wave periods and large wave heights and water levels. This type of structure was adopted in Portuguese ports, namely in the new multipurpose terminal of the Port of Leixoes.",2011

In these conditions, reinforcement corrosion due to diffusion of chloride ions is the main deterioration mechanism. This paper presents the results of a study of a 30 year RC jetty structure in Bandar e-Imam Port, in the Persian Gulf region. Concrete durability factors were investigated using conventional and non-destructive tests to obtain the intensity of deterioration. The results showed extensive deterioration due to chloride-induced corrosion. It caused great deduction for service life in this structure. Although this structure was repaired in the past few years, poor repair work and materials caused intensity of corrosion damage rather than control of it.",2011
TRAFFIC DEMAND FORECASTING FOR PORT SERVICES,planning; forecasting; traffic demand; commodity flows; port capacity,,"Successful management of any sea port depends primarily on the harmonisation of transport supply and demand, whereas their incompatibility leads to a number of problems. The port, i.e. its management, through its operation and part of port policy may affect the planning of the construction or modernization of its port facilities. In doing so, the specified planning requires forecasting and quantification of the needs for infrastructural services of specified port, i.e. assessment of traffic demand. Accordingly, the basic problem of research in this paper is forecasting of traffic demand for the port services by applying the appropriate forecasting methods. In order to find ways of solving concrete problems in the port operations the methods for traffic demand forecasting are set by applying the methodology and the presentation of the application of economic forecasting methods. The selected methods of demand forecasting for port services in demand are illustrated and tested on the example of the Croatian largest cargo port, the Port of Rijeka.",2011

STRAIN MEASUREMENTS IN PRECAST CONCRETE SEGMENTS OF A SHIELD-DRIVEN TUNNEL,Tunnel; Strain monitoring; Precast concrete segments,,"Although the Liefkenshoek Rail Link in the Port of Antwerp consists of a new double track railway section of 16 km length, the principal part is the undertunnelling of the River Scheldt and the Port Canal. In order to construct this undercrossing, two single-track tunnels with an individual length of 6,100 m are being built using the mixshield method. At specified cross-sections of the tunnel lining each segment is equipped with strain gauges attached to the reinforcement bars and inner concrete surface. Some critical sections are to be considered, such as the one located below the Port Canal, taking into account the extremely shallow ground cover of merely 1.1 m. The obtained measurement data will allow assessing the real-time behaviour of the concrete segments under numerous loading conditions during construction of the tunnel lining. Results will show that despite the rough conditions on site, strain monitoring proves an important aid to evaluate both the applied construction materials and the theoretical models for tunnel design.",2011
NEW KRK BRIDGE DESIGN ALTERNATIVES,Bridge; Bridge design; Structural design; Cable-stayed bridge; Arch bridge,,"The Island of Krk is situated close to Rijeka, the regional centre and the largest Croatian sea port. The International traffic corridor Vb, Budapest - Zagreb - Rijeka ends there. Since all the options of port expansion on land have been exhausted, the most logical solution for further expansion of the port and the town itself was seen in the commercial zone situated on the Island of Krk. With this in mind, construction of a new bridge for combined road and railway traffic is planned, which would enable crossing over from the mainland to the island. The existing bridge which connects the island with the mainland consists of two reinforced concrete arch structures with record size spans, built in 1980. Since these arches would not withstand any additional loads, alternative solutions are sought for a new bridge which would be built not far from the present location. Having in mind that the sea barrier to be spanned is approximately 650 meters wide and the canal depth is app. 50 meters, with the climatic factors defining this area as the zone of strong winds, and considering other limitations, different bridge alternatives are developed. Emphasis is placed on the durability and structural design. Special attention is given to the integration of the new bridge into its surroundings, since it is situated in a tourist area.",2011
Case History On The Design Of Foundation For Oil Storage Tank on Coastal Plain Sands,Ground Improvement; Preloading; Water testing; Bearing Capacity; Settlement,,"A tank farm to contain four oil storage tanks was proposed for an area lying close to the Abonnema Wharf in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. The intended tanks would be 25.0m diameter and 13.5m high. For a tank diameter of 25.0m, two boreholes to depth of 30.0m and three cone penetration tests with pore pressure measurements were considered adequate for the subsurface investigation. The subsurface investigation in the tank site disclosed that the upper portion of the soil deposits in the area is composed essentially of Coastal Plain Sands sediments with few intrusions of Mangrove Swamp soils. Beneath the upper clayey deposits is a prevalent deposit of sands. The Coastal Plain Sands formation is composed of sandy, clayey sediments which have been laterized through the leaching of silica and the concentration of alumina and iron. The laterization is generally enhanced by tropical weathering and where the sediments are sufficiently dry, the weathering process produces iron oxide as cementing agent in the soil profile causing the soil to be brown or reddish brown. The project area is characterized by a thick layer of this soil. From the analyses of the results of the laboratory tests, high total and differential settlement of the tanks would be expected if the existing ground was not treated. Ground improvement techniques such as replacement of the weak soils with competent soils, preloading of the tank area with a surcharge and controlled loading of the tank foundation during water testing were considered. Evaluation of the feasibility of adopting pad or concrete ring or concrete raft foundation for the tanks was also carried out. In this paper, is presented the ground improvement technique adopted, the foundation type selected, the bearing capacity and settlement analyses and the results of the water testing of the tanks.",2011

The port follows guidelines outlined in the Material Model Module (MMM) standard used in EPIC to insure a seamless interface with the existing code. Certain features of the model were not implemented using the MMM interface due to compatibility reasons; for example, a separate module was developed to initialize, store and update internal state variables. Objective strain and deformation measures for use in the material model were also implemented into the code. Example calculations were performed and illustrate the veracity of this new implementation.",2010
Influence of climate change on concrete durability in Yucatan peninsula,Global climatic change; Temperature; Infrastructure; Chlorides; Concrete; Durability,SEA-LEVEL; TEMPERATURES; RISE,"The environmental effects of global climate change (GCC) are becoming more evident. Nonetheless, efforts to document its effects on the durability of infrastructure are still limited. The present study used long term data (1961-2008) on temperature, relative humidity, precipitation and evaporation recorded in a tropical microclimate of the port of Progreso (Yucatan, Mexico) in order to detect climatic patterns associated to GCC. In addition, the authors analysed chloride profiles in concretes of different quality but of the same age (15 years) and exposed to the same microclimate. Results suggest the presence of environmental changes associated to GCC during the last 40 years, especially in terms of average and maximum temperature, which showed increases of 1 and 0.22 degrees C per decade respectively. Results also showed that seasonal and multiannual climatic cycles had an influence on the behaviour of the chloride profile of the studied concretes and thus on their durability.",2010

CORROSION MONITORING OF STEEL BARS IN SUPERSTRUCTURE OF OPEN-TYPE WHARF,nondestructive testing; monitoring; rebar corrosion; half-cell potential; superstructure of open-type wharf,,"Rebar corrosion is often observed in coastal concrete structures, resulting in degradation of structural performance. However, since rebar corrosion occurs inside of concrete, it is impossible to detect the initiation of corrosion from surface appearance of structures. To investigate the suitable method and timing of preventive repair against rebar corrosion, it is necessary to know when the corrosion starts inside of concrete nondestructively. This paper described the result of corrosion monitoring test on an existing port concrete structure to examine the nondestructive monitoring technology of rebar corrosion in concrete. In the test, half-cell potentials of rebars in concrete had been monitored for 7 years at a superstructure of open-type wharf. The measured potential decreased below the threshold value proposed by the ASTM criteria 5 years after the commencement of monitoring, expecting the initiation of rebar corrosion. To confirm this expectation, visual observation was conducted to the bottom surface of the superstructure. As a result, rust stain was observed close to the measuring point where the half-cell potentials were shifted. Consequently, it was concluded that it is effective to monitor half-cell potentials of rebars in concrete in order to detect the corrosion initiation nondestructively in existing port concrete structures.",2010
STRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE OF HEAVILY DETERIORATED RC MEMBERS SERVICED IN MARINE ENVIRONMENT FOR 44 YEARS,chloride-induced corrosion; structural perfoimance; disbonded reinforcement,,"Port and harbour structures are generally affected by harsh marine conditions. Material deterioration and damage to structural components are likely to occur throughout a structure's service period. Chloride-induced corrosion of rebar is one of the serious deteriorations in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. It is well known that the structural performance of heavily corroded RC members decreases. The methodologies, however, to evaluate and/or predict the structural performance of deteriorated RC members have not been established. While many researchers investigated the structural performance of RC members artificially corroded in laboratory, there have been few reports on RC members degraded under actual condition. This paper reports the structural performance of heavily deteriorated RC members serviced in marine environment. The tested RC members were taken out from an existing access bridge which had been in service for 44 years. In the tested RC members, covering concrete was completely spalling off and all the stirrups were broken. Some main rebars were broken and the remained ones were disbonded with concrete. Through the loading test, structural performance of tested RC members was investigated.",2010

However, both discourses have one thing in common they neglect the territorial and thus physical dimension of global flows. Hence, in this article I take the perspective of material flows to reconnect the discourses on cities and chains. I aim to clarify the role of urban places and their ability to attract, manage and redirect flows in such networks. I do so by re-examining classical concepts of spatial interaction and reorganization in human geography, Milt particular reference to centrality and intermediacy. The case of seaports and port cities is further explored to demonstrate the concrete conflicts and opportunities that arise with chain developments and insertion. To determine the relative position of places with regard to global chains and flows, Sheppard's concept of 'positionality' is discussed",2010
River Erosion and Civilization,damage; erosion; human activity; impact; water reservoirs,,"Humankind has been dealing with river erosion since ancient times. It has mainly negative impact on many man - made objects and human activities, such as settlements, bridges, transportation, water reservoirs, agriculture mining industry, and international relations. Settlements are impacted on by several means. Buildings are damaged by lateral erosion. Settlements are displaced subsequent to migrating river flows because of river - bed alterations. Settlements located next to large river deltas may be waterlogged. The accumulation of sediments lifts river - bed above adjacent territory, while intensive bottom erosion makes river penetrate deep into the ground. Impact on bridges is madeby both lateral and bottom erosion that threatens bank supports. Shipping suffers from bottom erosion and accumulation. Changes in water depth complicate navigation. Lateral erosion causes either damaging of port structures or their shifting away from river - bed due to degradation of opposite bank. If off - shore strip is shallow, this leads to estuaries' shifts. Not infrequently, due to sediment accumulation, ports turn out to be situated far from sea. River erosion also impacts pipeline transportation. This impact is made on mechanical pressure of pipelines underwater if pipelines are constructed along river - beds. Impact on automobile roads and railroads is similar to above - mentioned thing caused by lateral erosion. River erosion seriously impacts water reservoirs. As a result of hydrological regime change, all transported deposits and overwhelming majority of suspended sediments remain in water reservoirs. Total weight of sediment accumulated in water reservoirs of our planet amounts to 13. 4 billion tons per year. This process diminishes useful capacity of water reservoirs. Plant cultivation and animal husbandry are impacted, when river - beds wander along submountain deltas away from agricultural oases located on them. Fields and pastures also suffer from bank degradation if they are located nearby, from damaging water intake works used for irrigation and etc. River erosion is favorable for mining industry. It can be attained though the accumulating of deposit contain gold, platinum and cassiterite minefields by water. Alluvial gold deposits considerably contribute to total extraction of this metal. Such alluvial sediments as sand, gravel and pebble are often used as ballast, building material for concrete manufacturing or drainage ground for earthworks erection. River erosion impacts diplomatic relations as well. In many cases, international borders coincide with rivers, thus when river - beds shift, some pieces of territory turn out to be located in a neighboring country. Most often, it happens due to bank lateral erosion.",2010

"ASSESSMENT OF SYMS SURVIVAL LIMIT FOR ""PENG BO"" FPSO DURING INSTALLATION",,,"The ConocoPhillips ""Peng Bo"" FPSO in Bohai Bay, China, is one of the largest FPSOs in the world. It was installed in early 2009 and first oil was achieved in May 2009. The FPSO is moored to a jacket platform in about 27m water depth via a Soft Yoke Mooring System (SYMS). The mooring system consists of two yoke arms (port and starboard) connected at the jacket end to a turn-table that sits on a main bearing at the top of the jacket. The other ends of the yoke arms are integrated with two large ballast tanks which are attached to two pendulums supported by a rigid frame mounted on the forward end of the FPSO. The ballast weights give rise to the necessary system surge restoring force while the turntable and bearing allow the FPSO to weathervane. The yoke arms and ballast tanks are pre-installed with empty ballast tanks mounted on two temporary support barges while awaiting the arrival of the FPSO. Upon arrival, the ballast tanks are attached to the pendulums from the FPSO side. The tanks are then filled with solid concrete ballast to achieve the design weight. Before the tanks are completely filled, the SYMS may not have sufficient restoring force in partially filled condition to prevent excessive pitching of the yoke arms and severe bearing load on the jacket beyond the design limit due to large FPSO offset in the event of an unforeseen storm event. An analysis was carried out to estimate the maximum bearing load and yoke arm pitch angle when the ballast tanks were 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% full for 10-year and 100-year return period events. This paper describes the analysis methodology and results from the analysis. The overall project and installation experience are also discussed.",2010
CONSTRUCTION ANALYSIS OF REINFORCED CONCRETE BRIDGE PIER,Construction analysis; Bridge pier; Heat of hydration; Initial concrete temperature; Stripping formwork time,,"In this study, the construction of a reinforced concrete bridge pier is analyzed from durability point of view. The bridge is located at the western port area of Shenzhen, where the climate is high temperature and humidity. To control the cracking of concrete, a heat transfer problem as well as a thermal stress problem has to be solved. A shrinkage model for heat produced due to cement hydration and a Burger constitutive model to simulate the creep effect are used. The shrinkage due to the hygral and the plastic is considered. The modelling based on Femmasse (c) is verified by comparing with the testing results of a real underground abutment. For the bridge pier, the temperature and stress distribution, as well as their evolution with time are shown. To simulate the construction condition, four initial concrete temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C) and three demoulding time tips (48h, 72h, 96h) are investigated. From the results, it is concluded that a high initial concrete temperature could result in a high extreme internal temperature, which causes the early peak temperature and the larger principle stresses. The demoulding time seems to be less important for the chosen study cases. Currently used 72 hours in the construction practice may be a reasonable choice.",2010
DEFORMATION ANALYSIS OF BRIDGES IN EXCEPTIONAL TRANSPORTS IN SLOVENIA,deformation analysis; exceptional transport; bridges in Slovenia,,"In August 1999 an exceptional transportation of two steamers of 666 tonnes was performed from the Port of Koper to the Nuclear power plant in Krsko. The transport covered a distance of about 200km and represented one of the largest exceptional transports in Slovenia ever. Finding the best route represented one of the major issues, because the steamers had to cross more than 50 problematic sections and bridges, most of which have not been designed for such heavy loads. It was necessary to load-test almost all bridges on the route to determine whether those bridges need any extra supports or not. Consequently, a logistic operator has an important and indispensable role and becomes a co-modeller of logistic service. A deformation analysis or a polynomial interpolation of vertical displacements could also be used. Therefore, a laboratory load test of a concrete plate was made. The concrete plate was loaded with hydraulic cylinder PZ 100 with extensiometer up to 21kN. Every increase of load by 3kN was measured with Nikon Ser 800 total station.",2010

Mortar specimens were exposed to atmospheric environment at 12 monitoring stations scattered around Chittagong's metropolitan area. Mortars were made (using combinations of cement, lime, volcanic ash, and fly ash) with variable water-to-binder ratios and cement/binder content. The performance of the mortar specimens was evaluated based on marine salt accumulation and resistance to marine salt penetration. The amount of salts (Cl(-) and SO(4)(-) captured in powdered samples extracted from mortar specimens was determined using ion chromatography. Laboratory tests such as mercury intrusion porosimerty (MIP), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), accelerated chloride ion diffusion (ACID), and electrical resistivity (ER) were conducted on mortars, in addition to tests on fresh and hardened properties of mortars. Test results showed that the marine salt accumulation was significant up to a distance of about 200 m from the seashore. The analysis of accumulation and subsequent penetration of marine salts in exposed specimens identified the mortar types that are more resistant to the aggressive potential of the region's marine aerosol. The results suggest that volcanic ash and fly ash based mortars can provide better salt penetration resistance than cement based mortars. Recommendations of this study will be useful for local authorities engaged in selecting protective measures (in terms of external renderings) to improve the durability of infrastructures exposed to marine salts.

Residual magnetic stray field in ITER building and field perturbation on the plasma due to ferromagnetic iron components outside the vessel,Magnetic stray field; Bioshield; Ferromagnetic concrete; NBI,,"The present work evaluates, using 3D finite element (FE) electromagnetic (EM) analyses, the poloidal field coil (PFC) stray field reduction inside and outside the main ITER building due to the presence of ferromagnetic content in the concrete and other iron components outside the vessel (mainly the huge iron boxes of the NBI - neutral beam injector - and the iron doors at the end of the port corridors). To perform these analyses a 360, 3D EM model of the ITER building has been developed, named electromagnetic model of the building complex (EMMOBC), which includes the poloidal field coils, the plasma, a coarse model of the two heating & current drive (H&CD) NBIs, the coils of the NBI active magnetic field reduction system, and all the main building components that could include ferromagnetic materials. The plasma scenarios at the start of flat-top (SOF) and at the end of burning (EOB) have been considered. The effect on the stray field on the NBI due to the presence of the active (AMFRS) and passive (PMFRS) magnetic field reduction system of the near NBI and of the others iron component in the building has been evaluated, using EMMOBC that include the coarse model of the two NBIs. The coil currents of the AMFRS in the H&CD NBI have been optimized for the stray field coming from the SOF and EOB plasma scenarios at plasma current of 15 MA. The stray field at SOF and EOB, including the effects of the ferromagnetic iron content (outside the vessel), has been evaluated inside and outside the main ITER building using the EMMOBC. Finally the field perturbation produced on the plasma q = 2 surface has been evaluated. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2009
Evaluation and rehabilitation of Shuwaikh Port in Kuwait,Visual inspection; destructive and non-destructive testing; port rehabilitation; marine exposure,,"Shuwaikh Port in Kuwait was put into operation in 1960 but has had no systematic maintenance regime in place and has neither planned or undergone a major repair since the commissioning of the port. Accordingly, the process of degradation and deterioration of the whole of the infrastructure of the Port is becoming obvious and apparent. The preliminary visual inspection of the Port indicated widespread cracking, spalling and corrosion of reinforced concrete elements. Subsequently, a number of destructive and non-destructive tests were undertaken for the rehabilitation work to be carried out. This paper reports the investigation undertaken and presents the results of the above testing and the rehabilitative measures recommended to the Kuwait Port Authorities (KPA).",2009
MAKING THE EDIBLE CAMPUS: A model for food-secure urban revitalisation,Design; Sustainability; Urban Agriculture; Food Security,,"The Edible Campus project was begun in spring 2007 in Montreal. An action-research project launched by volunteers and researchers from two leading local NGOs and university-based researchers (Alternatives, [online]; Santropol Roulant, [online]; McGill University's Minimum Cost Housing Group, [online]), it sought creative solutions to turn underutilised urban spaces into productive places. It involved citizens in the creation of green community spaces by incorporating productive growing in containers on a prominent but concrete-covered port of McGill University's downtown campus. Not only is it on investigation into making cities more food-secure by increasing urban food production, it is also a live demonstration of how 'edible landscapes' can be woven into urban spaces without diminishing their utility or functionality.",2009
Reinforced concrete caissons for port structures in Spain,"concrete structures; maritime engineering; ports, docks & harbours",,"Reinforced concrete floating caissons are widely used for the construction of vertical breakwaters and gravity quay walls. This paper describes the caisson construction methods that are used most frequently in Spanish port structures, especially casting on floating dry docks. Determining factors in the selection of caisson type for breakwaters rely on technical and economic considerations. Environmental considerations emphasise the use of caissons when compared to alternatives that require large quantities of quarry stone materials such as rubble mound breakwaters. The main limiting factors are high stresses induced on the sea floor and the presence of complex dynamic wave-structure-soil interaction phenomena. Generalisation in the application of soil improvement techniques in the sea floor will extend the application of floating reinforced concrete caissons to soft-soil areas, which are very common in Spanish ports. There are also research programmes under development focusing on improving of the functional features of vertical wall structures, mainly determined by their high reflection. Technical and economic optimisation of marine structures based on floating reinforced concrete caissons is today an essential trend in the field of port structures in Spain.",2009
Evaluation of the effect of marine salts on urban built infrastructure,Sea spray; Marine salts; Mortars; External renders; Salt penetration resistance,ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION; HOLISTIC MODEL; CHLORIDE PENETRATION; CONCRETE STRUCTURES; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; DRY DEPOSITION; SEA; SALINITY; TRANSPORTATION; DETERIORATION,This paper presents the results of a study that evaluated the effects of marine salts on built infrastructures at the Port city of Chittagong in Bangladesh. Specimens made from five different types of mortars (normally used as external renders in built infrastructures such as buildings and bridges) with varying cement contents were exposed to atmospheric environment at 12 sampling stations scattered around the metropolitan area of Chittagong. The performance of the specimens was evaluated based on marine salt deposition and resistance to marine salt penetration. The study also monitored the deposition of chlorides and sulfates in wet candle sensors located at 12 stations. The type and amount of salts captured in powdered samples extracted from the mortar specimens as well as from wet candle sensors were determined using ion chromatography. The study showed that the marine salt deposition is significant up to a distance of about 200 m from the seashore. The analysis of deposition and subsequent penetration of marine salts in exposed specimens identified the mortar types that are more resistant to the aggressive potential of the region's marine aerosol. The results of this study can be very useful for local authorities engaged in selecting protective measures (in terms of external renderings) to improve the durability of infrastructures exposed to marine salts.

Building a breakwater with prefabricated caissons on soft clay,coastal engineering; geotechnical engineering; offshore engineering,,"This paper presents a case history of the construction of an offshore breakwater on soft clay using prefabricated, semicircular-shaped concrete caissons. The project was located near Shanghai Port, China. The breakwaters were designed as gravity-retaining structures, and used for deepening of the navigation channels along the Yangtze estuary. Some sections of the breakwaters were installed on a thick layer of soft deposit. During the construction, the caissons in one section failed under a heavy storm. The causes of failure were investigated. The design of the breakwater and the soil improvement works are described in this paper. Surcharge preloading and prefabricated vertical drains were adopted to improve the soft soils below the caissons. Some other measures, such as the use of anti-sliding mats for the base of the caissons to increase the base friction, and the use of geotextile with sand-filled geotextile tubes and geotextile and concrete block composites to prevent scour, were also adopted. These measures were proven to be effective in maintaining the stability of the breakwaters against subsequent heavy storms.",2009
A case study of damages of the Kandla Port and Customs Office tower supported on a mat-pile foundation in liquefied soils under the 2001 Bhuj earthquake,Pile foundation; Liquefaction; Lateral spreading; Mat-pile-soil interaction; Settlement,DISPLACEMENTS,"A case study is presented of the interaction between the bending due to laterally spreading forces and axial-load induced settlement on the piled foundations of the Kandla Port and Customs Tower located in Kandla Port, India, during the 2001 Bhuj earthquake. The 22 m tall tower had an eccentric mass at the roof and was supported on a piled-raft foundation that considerably tilted away as was observed in the aftermath of the earthquake. The soil at the site consists of 10 m of clay overlaid by a 12 m deep sandy soil layer. Post-earthquake investigation revealed the following: (a) liquefaction of the deep sandy soil strata below the clay layer; (b) settlement of the ground in the vicinity of the building: (c) lateral spreading of the nearby ground towards the sea front. The foundation of the tower consists of 0.5 m thick concrete mat and 32 piles. The piles are 18 m long and therefore passes through 10 m of clayey soil and rested on liquefiable soils. Conventional analysis of a single pile ora pile group, without considering the raft foundation would predict a severe tilting and/or settlement of the tower eventually leading to a complete collapse. it has been concluded that the foundation mat over the non-liquefied crust shared a considerable amount of load of the superstructure and resisted the complete collapse of the building.

"Memory and learning: Selecting users in the port of Rotterdam, 1883-1900",organisational memory; learning; local government; ports,ORGANIZATIONAL ROUTINES; CAPABILITIES,"During the closing decades of the nineteenth century, the port of Rotterdam experienced very strong growth. Changing views and concrete experiences induced the port to widen the initially limited circle of regular users of berths. We study this case in order to increase our understanding of the dynamic interrelationship between organisational memory and learning. While organisational memory guides the application of routines, this practical experience may also question underlying beliefs. Our study of deliberations by the Rotterdam government - to a significant degree representing the preferences of the local business elite - demonstrates how so-called lower order learning on the level of routines induces a so-called higher order learning on the level of beliefs. Finally, our case-study suggests that the traumatic nature of initial experiences that are part of organisational memory may hinder the deliberation of beliefs and thus retard higher order learning.",2009

"STUDY ON THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF NEW-TYPE OFFSHORE BREAKWATERS AND SAND BYPASSING ALONG SURUGA COAST, JAPAN",,,"Suruga Coast, which stretches from Oigawa Port to Yaizu in Shizuoka Prefecture, is known as one of the most eroded coastlines in Japan. As a measure against erosion, legtype offshore breakwaters were installed for the first time in Japan, in addition to conventional offshore breakwaters of deformed concrete blocks. This project, which consists of breakwaters and sand bypassing using sand collected from the beach west of Oigawa Port, has been continuously implemented. Investigation of the long-term effects of this composite shore protection measure has confirmed that long-term stability of the beach has been achieved through a combination of leg-type offshore breakwaters and sand bypassing and that this measure has brought about a change in the stability of the beach. In addition, the investigation has also provided an important insight into this measure as a comprehensive sand management system for future management of the coast.",2009

The application of electrochemical chloride extraction to reinforced concrete bridge members,Rehabilitation; desalination; repair,,"Some of the bridges of the Burman Road interchange in Port Elizabeth are located in a very high risk location and are in direct exposure to tidal and sea spray action. Chloride ions are derived from sea-water and sea spray and enter the concrete by absorption and permeation of chloride containing water and by diffusion through saturated or partly saturated concrete. Concrete members of the three most exposed structures exhibited such high chloride contents that there remained only 2 options, i.e. demolish and rebuild or remove some of the chlorides from the concrete. After detailed cost/benefit analysis, it was decided to demolish the most affected bridge and to electrochemically remove sonic of the chloride ions from the other two bridges. Electrochemical Chloride Extraction (ECE) involves placing a temporary electrolyte oil the concrete surface, and electrically driving the negatively charged chloride ions out of the concrete by negatively charging the reinforcing steel, and placing a positively charged anode in the external electrolyte. The chloride extraction system is commercially available and this is the first time it has been used in South Africa on this scale.",2009

Detecting Traffic Differentiation in Backbone ISPs with Net Police,Internet measurement; Traffic differentiation,,"Traffic differentiations are known to be found at the edge of the Internet in broadband ISPs and wireless earners [13. 2]. The ability to detect traffic differentiations is essential for customers to develop effective strategies for improving their application performance. We build a system. called Net Police, that enables detection of content- and routing-based differentiations in backbone ISPs Net Police is easy to deploy since it only relies on loss measurement launched from end hosts. The key challenges in building Net Police Include selecting an appropriate set of probing destinations and ensuring the robustness of detection results to measurement noise We use Net Police to study 18 large ISPs spanning 3 major continents over 10 weeks in 2008. Our work provides concrete evidence of traffic differentiations based on application types and neighbor ASes We identify 4 ISPs that exhibit large degree of differentiation on 4 applications and 10 ISPs that perform previous-AS hop based differentiation. resulting in up to 5% actual loss rate differences. The significance of differences increases with network load. Some ISPs simply differentiate traffic based on port numbers irrespective of packet payload and the differentiation policies may only be partially deployed within their networks. We also find strong correlation between performance differences and Type-of-Service value differences in the traffic",2009
Development of FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) for Rehabilitation of Marine Concrete Structure,fiber reinforced polymer; marine concrete rehabilitation; corrosion monitoring; structural monitoring,,"The durability of marine concrete structures has long been a concern of many countries, especially in the island country of Singapore, where many structures are constructed along coastal areas. Currently, the durability of concrete under marine conditions can be enhanced by the addition of admixtures, and using high grade concrete. The FRP system can also be used to increase the durability of the concrete structures under marine conditions, by preventing the ingress of chloride ions into the structures, thereby preventing the corrosion of the steel reinforcements. In addition, the FRP system has the additional function of increasing the strength of the structure. The FRP system, which composed of the epoxy developed and carbon fiber selected, was evaluated according to various standard testing methods to get the basic technical information of the FRP system. Full scale laboratory testing was carried out to determine the effectiveness of the FRP in enhancing the structural performance of concrete structures. Test results showed that the structural capacity of concrete beams can be increased, with the addition of the FRP system. A total of 8 marine structures (4 beams, 3 slabs and 1 pile cap) were chosen for installation and monitoring at the Port of Singapore Authority site. Results show that the corrosion rates were lower than the unwrapped (control) structures. It was also observed that the FRP wrapped structures had no durability problems under marine conditions. In addition, structural health monitoring was conducted using a system of Fiber Optic Sensors (FOS). Structural Monitoring results showed that beams wrapped with the FRP exhibited greater reductions in strain.",2009
Application of Fiber Bragg Grating Sensor for Rebar Corrosion,corrosion of rebar; sensor; FBG; application,,"Corrosion of rebar is one of the most important factors which can affect the durability of concrete structure, so in the service of these structures, measuring the degree of corrosion, and then evaluating the reliability of these structures are very important. The most significant characteristic of the rebar corrosion is its volume expansion. By the principle and characteristics of fiber bragg grating (FBG), a sensor for rebar corrosion is designed. In this paper, based upon laboratory studies, the fiber bragg grating sensor is applied in No. 58 Berth of Lianyungang Port. According to the filed condition, a proper embedding scheme is proposed. Considering the optimal sensor placement, the monitoring points are determined and five sensor groups were applied in the structure. Based on the results of the calibration experiment, the relationship between corrosion ratio and the change of wavelength is established. So the corrosion status of the structure can be obtained by measuring wavelength. The study shows that the FBG sensor was feasible to monitor the status of rebar in concrete structures.",2009
GEORISK: A GEOLOGIC RISK MAP FOR THE WORLD HERITAGE AREA OF PORTO CITY (NORTH PORTUGAL),,,"The growing concern for the preservation of heritage in face of natural hazards led to the appearance of the Regional Framework Operation (OQR) NOE - Heritage and Prevention of Natural Hazards under the Community Initiative INTERREG III C. The OQR NOE, led by the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur (PACA, France) region, together with the Northern Portuguese regional coordination agency (CCDR-N), Molise and Sicily regions (Italy) and eastern region of Attica (Greece) aimed at developing preventive measures to safeguard the cultural heritage due to occurrence of natural hazards. The main aims, were to undertake an evaluation of existing practices through a strategy of inter-regional cooperation among the partners NOE and develop concrete actions in the field including strategies for prevention, early warning and intervention adapted to the heritage, awareness and accountability of officials and local decision makers, implementation of trans European experience, development of new technologies, cooperation and support for Euro innovative operations. In this context arised the subproject (SP) GEORISK, that joined an inter-regional cooperation of the City Council Port (CMP), the Bureau de Recherches et Geologiques Mini (BRGM), the Department of Geology, Faculty of Science of the University of Porto (DGFCUP) and the Portuguese Institute of Architectural Heritage (IPPAR), now called the Institute for Management Architectural and Archaeological Heritage (IGESPAR).

Service life prediction of concrete wharves with early-aged crack: Probabilistic approach for chloride diffusion,Chloride; Cracked concrete; Crack width; Service life; Probability,TIME-DEPENDENT RELIABILITY; CORROSION; DURABILITY; FLEXURE; DAMAGE; STEEL,"Early-aged cracks due to hydration heat and drying shrinkage occur unavoidably in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. These cracks may be the main routes through which chloride ion penetrates into the concrete and also can be one of the major reasons of steel corrosion in RC structures exposed to chloride, such as port and ocean structures. In this paper, the service life of RC structures exposed to the marine environment conditions is predicted considering the crack effect on chloride penetration. First, diffusion coefficients in sound and cracked concrete of wharf structures are obtained through field investigations. Then, through the relationship between diffusion coefficients and crack widths, service life of the cracked concrete is predicted in the probabilistic framework of Monte Carlo Simulation. Furthermore, the predicted service life derived from the field investigations is compared with the values obtained from the traditional method based on allowable crack width concept.

Rehabilitation of road culverts on the equator. Implementation of innovative open cut and jacking/relining trenchless solutions,Lining; Jacking; GRP; Rehabilitation; Sewer; Design; Finite element analysis,,"Guyana, a French overseas department, is avast region of some 83,500 km(2), located on the equator on the edge of the Latin American continent. The department has 466 kilometres of national routes, most of which are located along the coast, linking the country's major towns Cayenne, Kourou and Saint Laurent - with the strategic points constituted by the Guiana Space Centre (which will shortly be receiving the Russian Soyuz rocket and the Italian Vega rocket), the port of Degrad des Cannes and the Rochambeau airport. Main passenger, goods and freight transport travels along the national routes. This road network comprises approximately 800 road-crossing water culverts of all sizes (width x height ranging from 700 x 500 mm to 4000 x 3000 mm). Of these, approximately 300 are metal, the remainder, of reduced section (diameter below 800 trim), being constructed of concrete. Following the collapse of structures in 2004, the Highways French Ministry (DDE) decided to secure the most critical structures. The Rouen CETE Laboratory was asked to produce a detailed list reporting on the state of these structures. This list identified approximately one hundred structures suffering from serious problems and distortion mainly caused by severe climate conditions with 4 m of rain per year, an aggressive environment and heavy road traffic. This led the DDE to consider replacement solutions or in-situ refurbishment and to issue the necessary invitations to tender, allowing bidders a free choice of techniques and products used. After a comparative analysis of bids, the following technical solutions were short-listed from among those submitted by bidding companies: for deep structures (more than 5 m deep) or on sections with the greatest traffic: pipes replaced with GRP shells (mainly in the shape of tube-like arches) or by jacking GRP non circular panels (either into the ground close to the structures to be replaced, or in situ and in line with the structures dismantled during the works) for other structures: trenched excavation of damage culverts, replacing them with GRP pipes having a diameter of between 600 and 1700 mm. This operation for which 9,2 M (sic) have already been invested for 111 culverts should be completed by the end of 2008 and has clearly highlighted the benefits of trenchless solutions for safe and quick work which does not affect in particular highway usage. The purpose of this paper consists in describing: the 3 different trenchless solutions, the criteria in favour of each, the design approach in accordance with the French National Project of Research and experimentation program RERAU 4 devoted to prefabricated channel lining systems and especially of structural GRP lining panels. For this project a new design method based on finite element method analysis (F.E.M.) was applied for the largest structures or with severe loads. the site phases from preparation to completion.",2009
Effect of portland cement fineness on ASTM C1260 expansion,ASTM C1260; alkali-silica reaction (ASR); ball mill; Blaine; expansion; portland cement fineness,POTENTIAL ALKALI-REACTIVITY; MORTAR BAR TEST; SILICA; CONCRETE,"The present study is aimed at investigating the effect of port land cement fineness on the results of ASTM C1260 tests-Standard Test Method for Potential Alkali Reactivity of Aggregates (Mortar-Bar Method). The effects of clinker alkali content, aggregate reactivity, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution concentration on the mortar expansion test results were also studied. In this study, high and low alkali Portland cement clinkers were selected and ground with gypsum in a laboratory ball mill to three fineness levels: 300, 400, and 500 m(2)/kg (Blaine). Moderately- and highly-reactive aggregates were tested with these cements according to ASTM C1260. In addition to the standard 1 N NaOH solution, a 0.5 N NaOH soak solution was also used. The results show that mortar-bar expansion was promoted with increased cement fineness regardless of clinker alkali, aggregate reactivity, or soak solution normality. Clinker alkali had no or little effect on moderately reactive aggregate; whereas it had considerable effect on highly reactive aggregate. Highly reactive aggregate tended to be more sensitive to cement fineness and alkalinity. Although cement fineness and clinker alkali content did not affect the classification in terms of potential reactivity of the aggregates used in this study, they might change the classification for the aggregates near the boundary between reactive and nonreactive aggregates. Specification of fineness and alkali content of cement, or both, might be beneficial to further improve the reliability and reproducibility of ASTM C1260.",2008
CoCONet: A collision-free container-based core optical network,photonic network; edge router architecture; central scheduler; G/D/1 queue; stochastic delay model,,"Electrical-to-optical domain conversions and vice versa (denoted by O/E/O conversions) for each hop in optical core transport networks impose considerable capital and financial overhead on the providers. In this paper, we propose a full-mesh topology driven core network with a central scheduler that handles the task of signaling and coordination among slot transmissions for every hop to eliminate such O/E/O conversions. We introduce the concept of a container as a macro data unit that forms a separate layer in the protocol stack above the optical layer. A FAST centralized scheduling algorithm is proposed based on a preemptive scheduling technique that can ensure that there are no collisions between the containers. We also analyze the complexity of this algorithm. Next we design the logical architecture for the core and edge switches following the de facto policy of moving the complexity to the edge. We also designed a hierarchical architecture for the edge switch and provide the respective block diagrams. To get a more concrete design prototype, we further proposed a generic (vendor independent) physical architecture for a single port of the switch considering SONET/SDH on the access side. Moreover, we develop a concise delay model for the containers to analyze the packet arrival process and derive the optimal container size, based on the link speed. Finally, we present some simulation results to study the performance of the algorithms and models proposed in our work. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2008
"'Decolonisation' on the periphery: Liu Xiang and shipping rights recovery at Chongqing, 1926-38",,,"Between 1929 and 1932, Sichuan militarist Liu Xiang pursued his own anti-imperialist agenda in Chongqing, a port city beyond the purview of China's 'central' Guomindang government. In both its autonomy and its defiant tactics, Liu's programme contradicted the Guomindang regime's official strategy of negotiated revision of the unequal treaties. In its concrete objectives, however, Liu's project was strikingly similar to the Guomindang's programme of shipping rights recovery, an effort to reduce the presence and power of foreign shipping in China's coastal waters and an integral part of its agenda for treaty revision. This essay examines Liu Xiang's efforts to eliminate the privileges of foreign shipping, bolster Chinese shipping and extend his regime's oversight over all shipping within his garrison area on the Upper Yangzi River. In examining Liu's local motives as well as his marginalisation of central government institutions like the Maritime Customs, the essay addresses his fraught relations with the centre, yet, in contrast to standard nationalist critique of China's early twentieth-century warlords, it also reveals how efforts like Liu's may have multiplied the sites of resistance to the unequal treaties and achieved a measure of 'decolonisation' on the periphery of central government control.",2008
"Environmental impact of port construction: Port of Sillamae case study (Gulf of Finlad, Baltic Sea)",,,"The aim of the study was to assess and map the location and status of environmentally sensitive areas (valuable marine habitats) near the Port of Sillamae, and to assess the potential impacts from the dredging and disposal operations on the local marine ecology (especially on valuable habitats). The observations and field measurements were carried out there since the time when the dumping site of radioactive substances from the former uranium enrichment plant at Sillamae was in use. The rate of erosion of the narrow separating dam of the dumping site and the velocities of accumulation of shore sediment were assessed in this study. The monitoring of seashore dynamics in recent years has been focused on an area east of the port. While being an attractive recreation area for the local people, that area is characterized by active natural processes. Repetitive measurements are carried out with the aim of monitoring the impact of the port on shore processes, particularly on increasing erosion of the shores. The most recent investigations since 2004 have not revealed any direct impact of the port facilities on shore dynamics. At the same time, changes caused by extremely strong storms of January 2005 or of winter 2006-2007 are evident Over the last 30 years, the average freezing date has shifted from December to January and ice break-up begins earlier. As a result, the ice-free period, when wave action can freely access the coast, gets gradually longer, and it happens mainly on account of more stormy autumn and winter months. Dredging and disposal operations may have either direct (removal or burial) or/and indirect effects (enhanced turbidity and sedimentation rates, and changes in hydrographic regime) on benthic invertebrates. Thus, the magnitude and direction of the effects depend on the processes involved. The data obtained before, during and after dredging and disposal revealed the re-establishment of directly affected communities following a year after the cessation of disturbance. The results of special monitoring program concluded that the environmental impact of the dredging operations on the benthic communities was minimal to moderate. Using the results of hydrodynamic modeling of the area at the Port of Sillamae, the behavior of suspended sediment plumes from dredging and disposal of concrete material was modeled using FRESCO high resolution, sigma coordinate, non-hydrostatic, baroclinic model system. Wind waves are calculated by narrow directional approximation model and the turbulent mixing based on the k-omega turbulence closer model. Numerical experiments have been performed for four nested marine basins with different space resolution. In the highest resolution nested domain the horizontal grid size was approximately 1/10 of nautical miles. Modeling results included spatial information on suspended sediment concentrations and sedimentation rates.",2008
THE USAGE AND STUDY OF MARINE ENGINEERING HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE WITH GROUND GRANULATED BLAST FURNACE SLAG POWDER,ground granulated blast furnace slag powder; marine engineering high performance concrete; resistance to chloride; electric quantity; chloride penetration coefficient,,"Along with development of mill technology, ground granulated blast furnace slag powder (GGBFSP) was extensively used in making up high performance concrete. In this paper, marine engineering high performance concrete (MEHPC) with GGBFSP was studied. Electric quantity and chloride penetration coefficient were emphatically studied. The resistance to chloride properties of reference concrete decreases with decreasing of water to cement ratio, but reference concrete doesn't satisfy the durability of MEHPC. The electric quantity and chloride penetration coefficient of high performance concrete whose water-binder is 0.35 remarkably decrease by replacing some cement with GGBFSP and it satisfy the properties of resistance to chloride. The suitable content of GGBFSP is 70% or so. MEHPC with GGBFSP was used in Yangshan Port of Shanghai International Shipping Centre.",2008
IMPACT RESISTANCE IMPROVEMENT OF REINFORCED CONCRETE BEAMS BY MIXING PVA SHORT FIBRE,port structure; reinforced concrete beam; repeated impact load; falling-weight impact loading test; PVA short fibre,,"This paper describes experimental investigation on the applicability of PVA short fibre to improve impact resistance of port concrete structures, such as concrete caissons for breakwaters. In the experiment, mechanical behaviour of reinforced concrete beams with PVA short fibre under repeated impact loads was examined by conducting falling-weight impact loading tests. In the tests, PVA short fibre content and impact velocity were changed to investigate their influence on the impact behaviour. As the results, it was found that the number of repetition of impact loading until ultimate failure was greatly affected by the impact velocity, and the effect was considerably changed between 2.0 m/s and 2.5 m/s. Also, it was made clear that the number of repetition of impact loading was increased in case of concrete beams reinforced with PVA short fibre. It was because that degradation of flexural rigidity caused by repeated impact loading was mitigated by the existence of PVA short fibre. Accordingly, it was concluded that impact resistance of concrete beams could be improved by mixing PVA short fibre into concrete, showing the possibility of port concrete structures with higher resistance against impulsive wave forces.",2008
EFFICIENCY OF SURFACE IMPREGNATION METHODS FOR PRECONDITIONED CONCRETE UNDER PORT ENVIRONMENTS,Surface impregnation method; concrete; chloride penetration; cracks; port environment,,"Surface impregnation materials have a great potential in the application for concrete structures exposed to port environments because they are expected to be able to prevent the water absorption and chloride penetration into concrete and consequently enhance the structural durability. There are two groups of popularly applied surface impregnation materials, namely silane-based water repellent agent and sodium silicate (water glass)-based sealer. To investigate their efficiency in repairing/improving the durability of reinforced concrete structures exposed to port environments, which are usually characterized with severe construction and service conditions, e.g. high humidity and frequent dry/wet cycling, etc., a research project was conducted to study the durability of concrete/reinforced concrete specimens treated with 5 different surface impregnation materials. The emphasis was on the effects of pre-conditions of concrete before the surface impregnation treatment considering the actual severe construction conditions during the execution of repair for the port structures. This paper summarizes key findings from this project. It is concluded that the long-term efficiency of a surface impregnation method largely depends on appropriate material selections and careful assessments on the initial conditions of the concrete substrates.",2008
Constraint-Based Multi-agent Path Planning,,GRAPH,"Planning collision-free paths for multiple robots traversing a shared space is a problem that grows combinatorially with the number of robots. The naive centralised approach soon becomes intractable for even a moderate number of robots. Decentralised approaches, such as priority planning, are much faster but lack completeness. Previously I have demonstrated that the search can be significantly reduced by adding a level of abstraction [1]. I first partition the map into subgraphs of particular known structures, such as cliques, halls and rings. and then build abstract plans which describe the transitions of robots between the subgraphs. These plans are constrained by the structural properties of the subgraphs used. When an abstract plan is found, it can easy be resolved into a complete concrete plan without further search. In this paper, I show how this method of planning can be implemented as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Constraint propagation and intelligent search ordering further reduces the size of the search problem and allows us to solve large problems significantly more quickly, as I demonstrate this in a realistic planning problem based on a map of the Patrick Port Brisbane yard. This implementation also opens up opportunities for the application of a number of other search reduction and optimisation techniques, as I will discuss.",2008
Prevention of cracking for large diameter concrete pipe piles,large diameter concrete pipe pile; cracking; prevention,,"Large diameter concrete pipe piles have been widely used in China since last nineties. Large diameter concrete piles mean those piles with diameter ranging from to 1.0 m to 1.4 m. Large diameter concrete pipe piles can either be pre tensioned or post tensioned. Pre tensioned pipe pile can be as long as 30 m, cast directly on a spinning machine. It can be spliced through welding steel board attached on the end of pile. Post tensioned pile is assembled of pre made pile sections. Tendons are run through duct in the wall of pile section. The tendons are tensioned and duct grouted to form a long pile. Large diameter pipe piles were used in many port and bridge projects. Longitudinal cracking was discovered and ignored. In the most serious situation, the longitudinal cracking penetrated the pipe wall and sea water dripped into pile. Recently, Chinese engineers began to take it seriously and try to prevent it. The cause of vertical cracking is analyzed. It is found that high compressive stress and too much blow count are responsible for the cracking. The problem is solved in two ways. One way is to limit the dynamic compressive stress and total blow count during pile driving. Another way is to strengthen the pile by adding fiber in concrete and reinforcement loop in the inside half of pipe wall. After adoption of these measures, things are much better improved, no crack is discovered anymore.",2008
Study on Structure of Arched Longitudinal Beams of Deep-Water Wharf,wharf; structural type; catenary arch; internal force; cost,YANGTZE ESTUARY; BRIDGES; MODEL,"High-pile and beam-slab quays have been widely used after several years development. They are mature enough to be one of the most important structural types of wharves in China coastal areas. In order to accommodate large tonnage vessels, wharves should be constructed in deep water gradually. However, conventional high-pile and beam-slab structures are hard to meet the requirements of large deep-water wharf. According to arch's stress characteristics, a new type of wharf with catenary arched longitudinal beams is presented in this paper. The new wharf structure can make full use of arch's overhead crossing and reinforced concrete compression resistance, improve the interval between transverse bents greatly, and decrease underwater construction quantity. Thus, the construction cost cab be reduced. Take the third phase project of the Yangshan Deep-water Port for example, comparative analysis on catenary arched longitudinal beams and conventional longitudinal beams has been made. The result shows that with the same wharf length and width, the same loads and same longitudinal beam moment, catenary arch structure can improve the interval between bents up to 28 m, decrease the number of piles and underwater construction quantity.",2008
SIMULATION-BASED ANALYSIS OF A CONCRETE ARMOUR UNITS MANUFACTURING PLANT FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A RUBBLE MOUND BREAKWATER,simulation; optimization; supply chain modelling; manufacturing; stacking yard,,"New port facilities at Punta Langosteira, on the northwest coast of Spain, involve the construction of a large rubble mound breakwater that requires thousands of concrete armour units that will have to be supplied as the construction project progresses. For that reason, a provisory plant has been built in situ where the concrete blocks are cast, transported and stacked. Due to the implementation of a DGPS system, the blocks life cycle can be traced and an assessment of strategies for minimizing the number of blocks moves became plausible. In this paper, we describe the operational analysis for the determination of a comprehensive and simple set of rules which may result in a cost-effective operation of the concrete blocks plant whilst meeting the procedural constraints. To do so, a simulation-based approach was adopted both using the commercial tool Delmia QUEST and developing our own ad hoc Java simulator.",2008
STUDY ON FIBER REPAIR MORTAR WITH THE PROPERTIES OF ABRASION AND IMPACT RESISTANCE FOR HYDRAULIC CONCRETE,,,"Be aimed at concrete surface damages of hydraulic concrete structures such as sea port, ship-lock and harbor etc. high strength repair mortar with polypropylene (PP) fiber and new type basalt fiber(BF) were made and their compressive, flexural and bending strength, bond strength between repair mortar and repaired concrete and abrasion resistance performance were studied. The result show that addition of fiber has a greater compressive and flexural strength than the blank at early age, but had a little bad influence in compressive and flexural strengths of 28d. The effect of fiber on the failure strength of cement mortar is not very obvious, but increase remarkably deflection at the same loading. The binders of acrylic acid latex paste and silica fume paste could improve remarkably bond strength of mortar. Addition of fibers had a meaningful effect on increasing abrasion resistance of mortar. Compared with the sample without fibers, wear ratio of PP fiber mortar had decreased 29% and abrasion resistance strength had increased 37% respectively.",2008
Simulation of Automatic Planning Process in the Poured Area of Vehicle-Mounted Boom-Mast,,REDUNDANT MANIPULATORS; ROBOT MANIPULATORS; OPTIMIZATION; CONSTRAINTS; ALGORITHM; MOTIONS; ARMS,"Automation of construction machines can decrease labor intensity of workers and its level of automation becomes high more and more. In this study, we will study the automatic trajectory planning of the end-port of boom-mast with redundant degrees of freedom, to improve the automatic performance of the vehicle-mounted boom-mast. A new algorithm for automatic trajectory planning is proposed in order to improve the automation degree of concrete pump car. By discretization to a concrete-poured area, by trajectory planning to each concrete-poured segment using the minimal joint torque method, and by automatic connection and automatic adjustment to every point of inflexion between two concrete-poured segments, the algorithm makes the automatic trajectory planning of any given concrete-poured area possible and makes the amount of the poured concrete even in the given area. The automatic planning simulations to a circle trajectory and a rectangle area are carried out, respectively, in order to test its validity of the proposed algorithm. The simulation results show that the motion gesture of the boom-mast arms calculated by the automatic planning algorithm is satisfying, and the automatic planning algorithm has a good robustness.",2008
Microstructure and Characterizations of Portland-Bottom Ash-Silica Fume Cement Pastes,Bottom ash; Silica fume; Compressive strength; TGA,CONCRETE; STRENGTH,"This research investigated the microstructure and characterization of Portland-bottom ash-silica fume cement Pastes. Bottom ash, a by - product from coal-fired thermal power plants, was obtained from Mae Moh power plant, Lampang, Thailand. It currently exists as waste approximately 1.5 MT per year and has not been Put to use. Unlike its counterpart, fly ash, which is recognized as an alternative material used to replace part of Portland cement. Silica fume, a nanomaterial from ferrosilicon industry, is nanoparticle and highly amorphous. It is highly pozzolanic reaction and could improve properties of Portland-bottom ash cement pastes. Thus, this research investigated the effect of silica fume on microstructure and characterization of Portland-bottom ash-silica fume cement pastes. The ratios of bottom ash used to replace Portland cement were 0, 10, 20 and 30 percent by weight and silica fume was added at 5 and 10 percent by weight. Compressive strength test was then carried out. SEM and TGA were used to study the microstructure of Portland-bottom ash-silica fume cement pastes. The results show that, the compressive strength of Portland-Bottom ash-silica fume cement pastes increased with added silica fume at 5 and 10 percent. SEM micrographs show C-S-H gel and silica fume around the cement particle in Port land-bottom ash-silica fume cement pastes which gives a highly dense and less porous microstructure. TGA graphs show Ca(OH)(2) decreased with silica fume content.",2008
Strengthening of an industrial cylindrical shell damaged by a collision,,,"This case-study concerns an old industrial reinforced concrete shell structure at the port of Antwerp. The building, serves as a pilot for stowing of shipped steel and wooden products. A fork-lift hit one of the supporting columns. The impact of the collision caused the concrete to crush and the internal reinforcement to shift considerably. Some of the internal reinforcement yielded or broke. Temporary supports had to be placed to avoid collapse Of the total structure. The stress situation is analyzed. A FEM model was built to gain insight into the stress distribution in the shell structure. In comparison with the undamaged situation, membrane forces. shear forces and moments did strongly increase which explains the actual damage. A solution is worked out to repair and strengthen the damaged part of the structure. The FEM-analysis, demonstrates that a compression arch will arise in the top of the barrel shell to span the displaced support. This requires a tension member at the bottom side of the concrete barrel. Therefore, externally bonded reinforcement is applied to increase the tensile capacity of the perimeter beam. The web reinforcement has yielded or is broken so that it is replaced by external CFRP reinforcement. After strengthening the structure, a monitoring system is installed. Strain gauges are glued oil several laminates. These measurements give feed back oil the structural behaviour of the strengthened structure and the applicability of the FEM Used. This case-study illustrates the load distribution mechanisms in the shell structure. the assessment of the actual condition and an appropriate intervention based on external reinforcement.",2008
Interface Bonding Between Hot-Mix Asphalt and Various Portland Cement Concrete Surfaces,,,"Interface bonding between hot-mix asphalt (HMA) overlays and port-land cement concrete (PCC) pavements can be one of the most significant factors affecting overlay service life. In this study, a direct shear test device was built and used to investigate the characteristics of the HMA-PCC interface and to determine the interface shear strength. Several parameters affecting the interface performance were included in this study, such as HMA type, tack coat type, tack coat application rate, PCC surface texture, and temperature. The test results showed that the use of SS-1hP emulsion resulted in a greater interface bonding strength than the use of RC-70 cutback. Surface mix SM-9.5 was found to have a better interface strength than binder mix IM-19.0. Among the four residual application rates considered in this study, 0.05 gal/yd(2) was found to be the optimum rate, independent of test parameters. The direction of tining in the PCC surface was found to have no effect on interface shear strength at 20 C. At the optimum tack coat application rate, the PCC smooth surface showed a higher interface shear strength than tined surfaces. When tests were performed at the intermediate temperature range, as the temperature increased, the interface bonding strength decreased.",2008

A study was undertaken to determine what contaminants, if any, were introduced to the soils underlying the site as a result of this best management practice ( BMP). The average infiltration rate at the site is approximately 10(-4) cm/s. The drainage area (5,208 m(2)) consists of grassy surfaces ( 36%), standard concrete / asphalt ( 30%), and roof surfaces ( 30%) that directly connect to the infiltration beds via downspouts and storm sewers. Composite samples of infiltrated stormwater were collected from the vadose zone using soil moisture suction devices. Discrete samples were collected from a port within an infiltration bed and a downspout from a roof surface. Samples from 17 storms were analyzed for pH, conductivity, and concentrations of suspended solids, dissolved solids, chloride, copper, and total nitrogen. Copper and chloride were the two constituents of concern at this site. Copper was introduced to the system from the roof, while chloride was introduced from deicing practices. Copper was not found in porewater beneath 0.3 m and the chloride was not significant enough to impact the ground water. This research indicates that with proper siting, an infiltration BMP will not adversely impact the ground water.",2007

This study examines the feasibility of ranching with hatchery-reared juvenile Haliotis laevigata Donovan and H. rubra Leach, in northern Port Phillip Bay, Victoria, Australia, and compares growth and survival of outplants on various artificial substrata. The experiments involve seeding 1,440 hatchery-reared juveniles, 10-30 mm size and aged 8-15 mo, at densities of 20-40 m(-2), onto concrete and basalt rock artificial reefs. On concrete artificial reefs, the mean survival of H. laevigata was 15% after two years, with a mean annual growth rate of 39 mm.yr(-1). For H. rubra, Survival was 9% over three years, and growth rate was 22 mm.yr(-1). No significant difference in juvenile Survival was detected on noncomplex concrete artificial reef versus complex concrete plus basalt rock habitats. Important lessons for ranching and stock enhancement on artificial reefs are discussed.",2007
"Impact of great December 26, 2004 Sumatra earthquake and tsunami on structures in Port Blair",,,"This paper reports on the effects of the great Sumatra earthquake and tsunami of December 26, 2004, in and around Port Blair, the capital city of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India. The earthquake shaking and subsequent tsunami caused substantial damage to structures that include buildings, harbors, overhead water tanks, seaport control towers, and so on. Other important structures, for example, dams, bridges, hangars, and so on, also suffered minor damage without disrupting their functioning. Reinforced concrete structures on the islands were the worst performers, while traditionally constructed timber and masonry structures performed well in response to ground shaking. The mandatory Indian Standards were not complied within the design of many recent structures on the islands located in the most severe seismic zone in India.",2007
BPEL4Chor: Extending BPEL for modeling choreographies,,,"The Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) is a language to orchestrate web services into a single business process. In a choreography view, several processes are interconnected and their interaction behavior is described from a global perspective. This paper shows how BPEL can be extended for defining choreographies. The proposed extensions (BPEL4Chor) distinguish between three aspects: (i) participant behavior descriptions, i.e. control flow dependencies in each participant, (ii) the participant topology, i. e. the existing participants and their interconnection using message links and (iii) participant groundings, i.e. concrete configurations for data formats and port types. As BPEL itself is used unchanged, the extensions facilitate a seamless integration between service choreographies and orchestrations. The suitability of the extensions is validated by assessing their support for the Service Interaction Patterns.",2007
Graph Decomposition for Efficient Multi-robot Path Planning,,,"In my previous paper (Ryan, 2006) I introduced the concept of subgraph decomposition as a means of reducing the search space in multi-robot planning problems. I showed how partitioning a roadmap into subgraphs of known structure allows us to first plan at a level of abstraction and then resolve these plans into concrete paths without the need for further search so we can solve significantly harder planning tasks with the same resources. However the subgraph types I introduced in that paper, stacks and cliques, are not likely to occur often in realistic planning problems and so are of limited usefulness. In this paper I describe a new kind of subgraph called a hall, which can also be used for planning and which occurs much more commonly in real problems. I explain its formal properties as a planning component and demonstrate its use on a map of the Patrick's container yard at the Port of Brisbane in Queensland Australia.",2007
"Sociological trend to investigate the forms of gender based violence, its frequency and inherent vulnerability & consequences among women and children in Nigeria",,,"Issues/Objectives: Violence towards women and children takes many forms - physical, sexual, psychological, restricted freedoms, coercion and threats which cuts across the segment of the society-the family institution, schools, the poor and the rich. The study aims to establish forms of gender based violence among women and children, its frequency, inherent vulnerability among the populace and attendant effects on the society. Methods/Description: The survey investigated the forms of gender based violence, its frequency and devastating consequences such as life long emotional distress mental health problems, poor reproductive health and SIT/STD/HIV/AIDS infections among 500 women and children victims in four locations in Nigeria-Port Harcourt, Lagos, Abuja and Kaduna. Results: The survey revealed that gender based violence was more rampant in homes, schools, tertiary institutions and the types of violence included rape, child abuse, abduction, abduction, torture, molestation, sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, dating violence, battering, verbal abuses and intimidation. The study revealed that victims were under unfavorable psychological, emotional and physical states, results of substance abuse, anger, poverty and transferred aggression from their abusers. Conclusion/RECOMMENDATIONS: Civil society, institutions, government should build and sustain strong multi-sectoral prevention strategies with systematic and sustained actions coordinated across the segment of the society; and urgent concrete measures (laws) to secure gender equality and protect women's human rights should be established and sustained in Nigeria. The root cause of gender based violence should be tackled i.e. to find out why this abusers demonstrate libidinous proclivity and unbridled bestiality, is it a function of environment? Does violent environment catalyze gender-based violence?.",2007
"Use of artificial substrata by introduced and cryptogenic marine species in Paranagua Bay, southern Brazil",marine bioinvasions; non-native species; cryptogenic species; habitat selection; biofouling; artificial substrata,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS; CAPRELLIDEAN FAUNA; ANTIFOULING PAINTS; COMMUNITIES; ASSEMBLAGES; CRUSTACEA; COLONIZATION; RECRUITMENT; CIRRIPEDIA; SETTLEMENT,"Ports are important locations for the introduction of marine species, while marinas and pontoons often serve as secondary habitats for these species. In a marina near Paranagua Port, a major international port in southern Brazil, the encrusting community was studied to (i) identify possibly introduced species, and (ii) examine the use of artificial substrata by these species. Samples ( 20620 cm) were taken from fibreglass floats (boardwalks and boat hulls) and concrete columns. A total of 85 species were found of which 50 were classified into three categories: four introduced, 33 cryptogenic and 13 native. The introduced species were the hydrozoan Garveia franciscana ( on floats, boats and submerged concrete), the polychaete Polydora cornuta ( more abundant on floats and submerged concrete) and the barnacles Amphibalanus reticulatus ( equally abundant on the three substrata) and Striatobalanus amaryllis ( only on floats and submerged concrete). Organisms were most abundant on floating boardwalks, while species richness and composition were similar to that on boat hulls ( 32 and 37, respectively), which are an important vector for intraregional transport. All substrata supported at least three of the four introduced, and many of the cryptogenic species. The proportion of introduced to the total number of species was greater than observed in other ports. This demonstrates that the introduction potential is great in Paranagua Bay, especially considering that this study was restricted to one site and sampled only hard substrata. None of the introduced species has yet been identified as invasive, but all are generalists with respect to substratum, indicating their invasive potential. The ability to colonise stable concrete walls shows that they could also colonise the natural granite rocky substrata in the bay, and the ability to colonise floating surfaces indicate their capability of spreading in the region on the hulls of recreational boats.",2007
Improving tomorrow's infrastructure: Extending the life of concrete structures with solid stainless steel reinforcing bar,,,"Stainless steel reinforcing has been used in numerous structures throughout North America, including the Progreso Port Authority Bridge, Yucatan, Mexico, in 1937; the Haynes Inlet Slough Bridge, North Bend, OR, USA, in 2002; the Belt Parkway Bridge over the Ocean Parkway, Brooklyn, NY, USA, in 2004; and Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge on the Capitol Beltway, Washington, DC, USA in 2006. Recent advances in concrete technology have provided structural designers with materials which can easily last over 100 years, and the life of many concrete structures today is limited by the reinforcing. Improvements in the life of the reinforcing can translate directly into extended life of the structure. Current projections by several transportation agencies show that the use of solid stainless steel reinforcing bar in bridge decks will more than double the life of the bridge deck. While solid stainless steel reinforcing bar can increase the cost of the bridge deck by as much as 12% (compared to carbon steel reinforcing), the economic value of the longer life outweighs the initial higher cost. In most cases, the additional cost of solid stainless steel reinforcing bar represents less than 1.5% of the total cost of the structure. Most concrete structures are designed with minimum concrete cover over the reinforcing bar which is required to protect the reinforcing bar from corrosion. Where the reinforcing bar is completely resistant to corrosion, the cover can be reduced, saving costs of concrete and reducing the total weight of the structure. In some structures, design savings made possible by the use of solid stainless steel reinforcing bar will offset as much as 100% of the initial cost increase from. using the stainless reinforcing.",2007
BHP billiton iron ore car dumper 4 - Temporary works,,,"BHP Billiton's new rotary iron ore car dumper installation at Finucane Island (Port Hedland) was constructed to increase the total capacity of the port facility from 110 Mtpa to 120 Mtpa and to allow for incremental capacity increases in future. The arrangement of the dumper is similar to other car dumper installations existing on site. To construct the facility, approximately 120 000 m(3) of material was excavated in six months, to a total depth of 22 m. The saline water table was nominally 6 in below ground level and the materials excavated varied depending on depth, ranging from sand to mangrove muds. There was a need to retain the sides of the excavation and limit the amount of water from entering the excavated area. This was required to allow excavation to progress and had to be maintained during construction of the permanent concrete and steel facility. The excavation was backfilled progressively as construction progressed. Various retaining wall methods were investigated with the preferred option being sheet piles secured by walers and ground anchors. Detailed electronic models were developed and assessed to complete the final design arrangement. Dewatering bores around the perimeter of the excavation removed the groundwater to intercepted sumps within the site. A strict and methodical program was developed to monitor the integrity of the temporary works and the quality of the groundwater. The works were completed on time despite the following challenges being encountered: availability of resources and equipment, movement of mobile plant on 'boggy' materials, difficulty driving sheet piles into material at depth, drilling of ground anchors to 32 m, grouting of ground anchors, greater than expected groundwater flows, and the risk of hydrocarbons within the groundwater. The lessons learned from the use of the retention system and, in particular, the associated construction challenges overcome, provide a sound basis for similar work in this buoyant resource market. The conference paper describes the temporary works options investigated, design considerations and processes, construction methodology and challenges encountered, and the monitoring systems developed. Lessons learned are also discussed.",2007
Tsunami vulnerability of buildings and people in South Java - field observations after the July 2006 Java tsunami,,,"A team of scientists from New Zealand and Indonesia undertook a reconnaissance mission to the South Java area affected by the tsunami of 17 July 2006. The team used GPS-based surveying equipment to measure ground profiles and inundation depths along 17 transects across affected areas near the port city of Cilacap and the resort town of Pangandaran. The purpose of the work was to acquire data for calibration of models used to estimate tsunami inundations, casualty rates and damage levels. Additional information was gathered from interviews with eyewitnesses. The degree of damage observed was diverse, being primarily dependant on water depth and the building construction type. Water depths were typically 2 to 4 m where housing was seriously damaged. Damage levels ranged from total for older brick houses, to about 50% for newer buildings with rudimentary reinforced-concrete beams and columns, to 5-20% for engineered residential houses and multi-storey hotels with heavier RC columns. 'Punchout' of weak brick walls was widespread. Despite various natural warning signs very few people were alerted to the impending tsunami. Hence, the death toll was significant, with average death and injury rates both being about 10% of the people exposed, for water depths of about 3 m.",2007
STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING OF HARBOUR PIERS,,,"The evolution of container and bulk ships involves the need of increasing the water depth in ports and the loads sustainable by quay walls and piers. Consequently, existing ports are facing expensive interventions to dredge navigation channels and berths and to strengthen or replace structures that have already been subjected to degradation. The paper will present some experiences that have been or are being conducted in the Port of Genoa in installing and managing instrumental monitoring systems on piers with the aim of performing short to medium and long-term control of the efficiency and safety conditions of such structures. In particular, two examples of monitoring the walls underlying existing piers that have been subjected to strengthening and dredging of the contiguous basins will be discussed, in view of the validation of the efficiency of the refurbishment works. Another example, consisting of the monitoring of a prestressed concrete pier, will also be presented. In all the cases, the monitoring systems are based on fibre-optic deformation sensors. The efficiency of the monitoring systems will be discussed considering the aspects of durability and maintainability for long-term operation in severe environments. The issues of data interpretation will also be addressed.",2007
Thermal performance of a monolithic thin-shell concrete dome,,,"A 3,000 sq.ft., two-story monolithic thin-shell concrete dome custom home was constructed in 2005 in Mesa, AZ, by the author. This architectural construction style represents a small, but growing, commercial and residential market, one of whose selling points is energy efficiency. During the preliminary architectural design phase, the only anecdotal and case studies available to the author were mainly related to cold-weather climates. No technically adequate thermal performance studies were found for the opposite, high temperature extreme of climate conditions. To address this need, two models are developed and explored. First, a preliminary lumped-parameter model (initially created to lend technical credence to the exuberant claims of dome aficionados and provide rationalization for the custom home construction project), is compared with actual data collected at the dome during construction. Because the correlation is not very good, a second model based on thermal two-port transmission line theory, is developed. This model provides additional insight, and in particular, comparison with the actual data suggests that model verification will require a somewhat different approach to data collection itself (and to the manner in which the model is utilized). This is confirmed using a small set of subsequent trial data. Thermal models aside, actual utility consumption data for the dome is compared with two conventional block-construction homes in the same geographic locale, showing that the dome thermal performance, at least during the hot months of the year, provides a measurable advantage. Finally, it is shown how the transmission line model makes it very easy to explore the thermal effects of reversing the order of the primary material layers (insulation and concrete).",2007
The behavior of large diameter rock-socketed piles under lateral loads,large diameter; rock-socketed; CFST piles; horizontal capacity; pile-soil interface; load test; FEM,,"Large diameter rock-socketed piles have been extensively used in the foundation of platform and offshore engineering. Behavior of the large diameter rock-socketed CFST (concrete filled steel tube) piles under lateral loads is studied based on field tests and numerical analysis for piles for a port. The CFST piles are 2800 mm in diameter and 40m in length, with 5.2m socketed into the rock. The horizontal capacity and deformation of the large diameter rock-socketed piles is analyzed from the measured results of displacement and internal force of piles. The interactive behavior of pile-rock and the influence of backfilled sand on horizontal capacity are also discussed. Using FEM considering the properties of the pile-soil interface, the test results are simulated numerically and the design of a reasonable socketed length is studied.",2007
Specifying input port bounds in SDL,,,"According to the SDL semantics, input ports ""may retain any number of input signals"", and therefore may grow without upper bound. While this is a convenient property on design level, it may lead to illegal behaviour on concrete hardware platforms when a queue overflow occurs, especially in the context of distributed embedded systems with severe storage constraints. In this paper, we present a straightforward extension of SDL in order to specify input port bounds formally. In our solution, bounds are associated with signals and input ports. We define both the concrete and abstract grammar and the formal dynamic semantics of the proposed SDL extension. We have implemented the extension in Cmicro, and illustrate our solution by examples from the Assisted Bicycle Trainer, a wireless sensor network.",2007

Sudden failure of a heavily loaded container pavement,,,"The case history of a sudden and unexpected failure in a pavement designed for 82 Mg axle loads at Port Botany in Sydney, Australia has been prepared using data derived from investigation of the failure. Failure of the pavement, comprised of an asphaltic concrete surface, unbound granular fine crushed rock base, crushed sandstone subbase, and sandy subgrade, and designed using the rational method-CIRCLY, occurred within days of being put into service. The failure resulted from a 20-30% increase in base course saturation levels following compaction that led to partial liquefaction under repeated heavy loading.

The intact areas recovered over time without intervention through a moisture equilibration process as evidenced by an increase in measured pavement stiffness and loss of moisture within the pavement profile.",2006
Lessons from practice: Architectural education and the notion of critical inquiry,architectural education; beginning design education; analysis; design strategies; architectural practice,,"The second-year studio presented here investigates the potential of reducing the gaps between the academy and professional practice by using the results of practice as a teaching tool, Port of a two-semester sequence intended to introduce students to the fundamentals of architectural form and space, the design studio emphasizes discipline-specific notions of inquiry, exploration and process. The range of fundamental concerns is addressed through in-depth analyses of exemplary buildings in order to discover how practicing architects hove incorporated basic design principles into overall design strategies. The ""design in the style of"" methods that characterized architectural education of the Ecole des Beaux Ads and the pattern books which served as sources for 19th and early 20th century practice in North America provided definitive models that were subject to limited interpretation. In contrast, the analyses projects described here do not provide ""answers"" to questions regarding style, but rather focus questions on a range of concerns which ore fundamental to architectural practice. Employing exemplary projects in beginning-level studios assists in demonstrating that highly regarded practitioners aspire to a synthesis of program/use requirements, conceptual ideas, structural solutions and constructional systems. The fact that the students were able to make concrete connections between their activities and the profession resulted in on intensity and sense of purpose that is evident in both the process and products of the studio.",2006
Coaxial/cylindrical transition line for broadband permittivity measurement of civil engineering materials,permittivity measurements; civil engineering materials; coaxial/cylindrical transition line,ENDED COAXIAL PROBE; DIELECTRIC MEASUREMENTS; COMPLEX PERMITTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS; REFLECTION; CONCRETE; CALIBRATION; DESIGN; SENSOR; CELL,"A one-port coaxial/cylindrical transition line is considered for the broadband complex permittivity measurement of civil engineering materials. Cylindrical samples of heterogeneous material with large aggregate dimensions (up to 25 mm) can be measured over a frequency range from 50 MHz to 1.6 GHz. The choice of this line technology results in the simplification of the sample machining and enhancement in the high frequency limit, in comparison to the classical coaxial line technology. From a mode-matching technique, the relation between the material complex permittivity and the reflection coefficient at the coaxial/cylindrical transition is obtained including axisymmetric higher order modes excited at the transition. Once the line is calibrated using a specific calibration kit, complex permittivities are retrieved from an iterative optimization procedure. Preliminary results obtained for a set of bituminous concrete samples with different porosities and natures of rock aggregates are shown.",2006
Towers of silence: The rise and fall of the grain elevator as a Canadian symbol,,,"The grain elevator, an ordinary industrial building of American origin, has over the years emerged as a popular symbol of Canadian life, albeit one that is now vanishing from the landscape. Both the tall, wooden country elevators in Prairie towns and the concrete terminal elevators of port cities have taken on this symbolic role, although praise for ""the grain elevator"" has often not differentiated the two. The reason for their iconic status is somewhat elusive. The admiration expressed by European architects and historians was the foremost reason that Canadian architects and architectural historians began to identify the terminal elevator as an important element of Canadian architecture. Wooden country elevators have evoked description as ""prairie sentinels"" or ""prairie cathedrals"". The appearance of both types on Canadian stamps and currency has given formal-recognition to their symbolic value. As part of Canada's economic and agricultural histories, as well as the country's architectural and cultural histories, grain elevators not only are tied to the special knowledge relevant to their use, but also generate shared meaning.",2006

It is believed that an operable strict corresponding technical criterion would be set down as soon as possible for engineering practice.",2006
Statistic study on application of geosynthetics for seepage and erosion prevention,seepage; erosion; tensile strength; construction; statistics,,"Many sea reclamation projects have been preceded in Japan in order to expand the port and harbour facilities and other infrastructure. These reclaimed lands are surrounded by seawalls, which usually consists of a series of concrete caissons that rested on rubble mound embankment, a cover of concrete blocks in the sea side, a cover of backfill stones with gentle slope in the land side, and a permeable geosynthetics sheet as filter placed on the slope of the backfill stones to hold the reclaimed soil. The damages in geosynthetics sheet introduce the seepage of fine particles from the reclaimed soil to the sea through the backfill stones and rubble mound. The appropriate geosynthetics should be selected from consideration of the function of filter, durability during and after construction. However, as there is a limited research effort for the subject, the type of geosynthetics has been empirically selected by each port construction bureaus. In this study, the statistics investigation on application of geosynthetics for seepage and erosion prevention was conducted in which the field case histories were accumulated and analysed.",2006

Underwater application of structural health monitoring at fairview cove container terminal,structural health monitoring; fibre optic sensor; Fabry-Perot; Bragg; marine; strain,,"To be able to offer services to the world's largest container vessels, commonly known as Post-Panamax vessels, the Halifax Port Authority launched a dredging project to increase the berthing depth at its Nova Scotia facility. To monitor the movement of the existing pier during and after construction, sensors were installed in the sub-sea foundation 14 in below mean sea level. Vibrating wire strain gauges were attached directly to steel sheet piles (positioned adjacent to the existing concrete cribs) and both Bragg grating and Fabry-Perot fibre optic sensors were attached to anchor bolts used to attach the sheet piles to the cribs. Strain monitoring over approximately an eight month period indicted that the sub-sea shoring of the crib foundation has become engaged to resist the slight settlement of the cribs. The resulting stresses are very low, however, confirming that the cribs are performing well within design and functional limits. The project also confirmed the durability and effectiveness of the use of fibre optic sensors in marine environments.",2006
"Predict throughput of Tianjin Port based on GM (1,1) (ID : 6-007)",grey model; throughput of goods; throughput of containers; error check,,"Port throughput plays a great role in contracting with highway, railway and so on to some degree. However, Tianjin port is not only port of Tianjin, but the window of Beijing and is the most important sea-route of the North China and the Northwest of China.

Management of multi-queue switches in QoS networks,on-line algorithms; competitive ratio; competitiveness; multi-queue switch; packet switching; buffer management; quality of Service,,"The concept of Quality of Service (QoS) networks has gained growing attention recently, as the traffic volume in the Internet constantly increases, and QoS guarantees are essential to ensure proper operation of most communication-based applications. A QoS switch serves m incoming queues by transmitting packets arriving to these queues through one output port, one packet per time step. Each packet is marked with a value indicating its priority in the network. Since the queues have bounded capacities and the rate of arriving packets can be much higher than the transmission rate, packets can be lost due to insufficient queue space. The goal is to maximize the total value of transmitted packets. This problem encapsulates two dependent questions: buffer management, namely which packets to admit into the queues, and scheduling, i.e. which queue to use for transmission in each time step. We use competitive analysis to study online switch performance in QoS-based networks. Specifically, we provide a novel generic technique that decouples the buffer management and scheduling problems. Our technique transforms any single-queue buffer management policy (preemptive or non-preemptive) to a scheduling and buffer management algorithm for our general m queues model, whose competitive ratio is at most twice the competitive ratio of the given buffer management policy. We use our technique to derive concrete algorithms for the general preemptive and non-preemptive cases, as well as for the interesting special cases of the 2-value model and the unit-value model. We also provide a 1.58-competitive randomized algorithm for the unit-value case. This case is interesting by itself since most current networks (e.g. IP networks) do not yet incorporate full QoS capabilities, and treat all packets equally.",2005
Performance of concrete wharves constructed between 1901 and 1928 at the Port of Montreal,alkali-silica reaction; corrosion; durability; microstructure; sulfate attack,,"An evaluation of concrete properties of five wharves in the Port of Montreal, constructed between 1901 and 1928, was undertaken to investigate the underlying causes of deterioration. The evaluated wharves consisted of either reinforced concrete caissons or massive concrete elements. The wharves were used in the past either as cargo loading docks or for the storage of various materials, some of which were detrimental to concrete. The evaluation program included visual examination of distressed concrete located above water level and the determination of compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, rapid chloride ion permeability (RCP), water soluble chloride ion penetration profiles, as well as a detailed microstructural examination, This article discusses the various results pertaining to the quality of the concrete and Gunite repairs found in old marine structures such as these, where various modes of degradation were present including ice abrasion, cracking and spalling, alkali-silica reaction (ASR), sulfate attack, and frost damage. These various modes of deterioration affected the quality of concrete in all examined wharves as well as that of previous repair work, demonstrating the need for new repairs. However, despite exhibiting signs of severe damage, the concrete wharves had reasonable strength and elastic modulus values enabling rehabilitation to increase service life. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

"Non-regular shippers: an alternative service to diminish the empty container traffic, a first and comparative approach to the ""Rotterdam"" and ""Le Havre"" port cases",empty containers; maritime transport service; Rotterdam and Le Havre; traffic tendencies,,"Nowadays, empty container traffic. is an explosive phenomenon in ports, which provoke high transport capacities. In this paper., some countries which regular have container sea links with ""Rotterdam"" and ""Le Havre"" were compared in function of both their empty container traffic evolution and their economic environment. A new service called ""non-regular shippers"" is proposed as a possible alternative, to profit empty container traffic. Comparison might allow us to understand the connection between the world's empty container traffic, containers port's rank and the general economic environment ill the countries linked with both ports. The criterion to measure the port's empty traffic evolution is a basic and concrete rate called ECTER which allows us to establish an appropriate comparison between ports and to define the empty container tendencies to each one. A systematic analysis is introduced in this study to identifying 48 Countries linked to each port, based on the technique of standardised principal components analysis. Principal components allow LIS to clarify the mutual influences and to compare it between partner Countries of both ports, and to identify some partner's countries with the potential to develop the proposed ""non-regular shippers"" service.",2005
Dewatering at the Port of Ngqura: A case study,,,"Southern Africa's first Industrial Development Zone is taking shape near the city of Port Elizabeth. The Coega IDZ is a purpose-built industrial estate for local and international industrial developers. The new international deepwater port of Ngqura forms a vital component of the Coega IDZ. Its three mass concrete quay walls were constructed in a dewatered excavation on the beach next to the Coega River mouth. This paper presents the design, installation and performance of the dewatering installation with specific focus on implementation of the observational method. A major challenge for the dewatering design was the timely draw down of resident water levels in two distinct aquifers ahead of the earthworks operations - the first quay had to be operational within 88 weeks. This was achieved through a combination of a cut-off against the sea, perimeter deep wells and surface pumping. Problem areas were dealt with by well pointing to stabilise excavation sidewalls and to locally control elevated seepage.",2005
T-shape barge design for transportation and mating of Sakhalin II topsides,Sakhalin Phase II Project; LUN-A; PA-B; new built barge; float-over mating; transportation and installation; stability; Concrete Gravity Based Structure (CGBS),,"The barge design and the fabrication of LUN-A and PA-B topsides of Sakhalin Phase II Project are carried out by Samsung Heavy industries (SHI). Since the topsides are quite heavy, a newly devised barge is needed for the purpose of transportation and installation of these topsides in site. The design and construction of the barge shall be suitable for the load-out, transportation and float-over mating of topside with heavy loads. This paper is prepared to introduce the design of barge for transportation and installation of LUN-A and PA-B topsides of the Sakhalin II Project. The noticeable difference of the barge comparing with other conventional cargo barges is in the shape. The barge has sponsons of T-shape that protrudes from its port and starboard in the aft body outwards. The sponsons are aimed to provide the additional stability of the barge, since it would not provide the adequate stability for transportation without that kind of structural appendage. In addition, the whole ship analysis and the hold analysis for structural strength assessment of the barge are carried out. The ""Dynamic Loading Approach (DLA)"" for the structural analysis is adopted in which the dynamic loads are determined explicitly. As a result of the above strength assessment and buckling check, Sakhalin NBB is safe to transport and installation the considering the topside.",2005
Leaching and mechanical behaviour of concrete manufactured with recycled aggregates,,,"The reuse of debris from building demolition is of increasing public interest because it decreases the volume of material to be disposed to landfill. This research is focused on the evaluation of the possibility of reusing recycled aggregate from construction or demolition waste (C&D) as a substitute for natural aggregate in concrete production. In most applications, cement based materials are used for building construction due to their cost effectiveness and performance; however their impact on the surrounding environment should be monitored. The interstitial pore fluid in contact with hydrated cententitious materials is characterized by persistent alkaline pH values buffered by the presence of hydrate calcium silicate, port-landite and alkaline ions. An experimental plan was carried out to investigate concrete structural properties in relation to alkali release in aqueous solution. Results indicate that the presence of recycled aggregate increases the leachability of unreactive ions (Na, K, Cl), while for calcium the substitution resulted in a lower net leaching. In spite of the lower mechanical resistance (40% less), such a waste concrete may be suggested as more environmentally sustainable. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2005

Shield structure optimisation studies for the west beam port of the KAMINI reactor,,,"KAMINI is the Kalpakkam Mini Reactor and its main purpose is to cater to the experimental needs and for neutron radiography. It is a water-cooled reactor with U-233 as the fissile material. The reactor has three neutron beam ports for experimental needs, which are made of graded cylindrical aluminium channel. All the beam ports start from the core, pierce the biological shield and are 2 m long. The shield structure optimisation studies for the beam port towards the west side of the reactor are presented here. The diameter of the west beam channel at the core centre is 54 nun and at the other end is 250 mm. The west beam tube opening is 530 mm below the floor level and hence the pit housing the experimental cavity is below the floor level with dimensions 2 m x 2.5 m x 1.3 m. The beam tube opening into the experimental cavity serves as the neutron source for radiation physics experiments and is assumed as a surface source in the calculations. Rough estimate of the shield design is made based on the literature on dose-equivalent index transmission through concrete for average neutron energy of 1.5 MeV. Detailed radiation transport calculations are performed using Monte Carlo neutral particle transport code (MCNP) to optimise the shield design. Neutron and capture gamma dose rates at the accessible areas are estimated. The contribution of prompt fission gamma rays is found to be negligible compared to the dose rates due to capture gamma rays. The details of the optimised shield structure proposed for the west beam port are as follows. Fixed concrete shields of thickness 650 mm on the lateral sides and a composite shield (500 mm paraffin and 50 turn concrete) in the front side at a distance of 1 m from the beam tube opening are recommended inside the experimental pit. During reactor operation, a composite mobile shield (500 mm paraffin and 500 mm concrete) closes the experimental cavity at the floor level. Fixed concrete shields are recommended to close the pit fully. The shield structure proposed increases the experimental cavity volume from 0.2 to 1.4 m(3) with the dose levels at the accessible areas less than one muSv/h. The MCNP computed neutron and gamma dose rates are compared with the measured values with the existing shield structure to verify the source term used. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Hydraulic design of a longitudinal culvert for lock filling and emptying systems,culverts; locks; US Army Corps of Engineers; inland waterways,,"The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is planning navigation improvements for many projects to meet predicted increases ill tow traffic. Some of these improvements include the addition or replacement of the navigation lock. Innovative design and construction techniques are being investigated to try and reduce construction costs as well as operation and maintenance costs. The Corps identified that a savings in lock construction Could be achieved if the conventional concrete gravity lock walls with culverts inside them Could be replaced with thin walls and longitudinal culverts located inside the chamber. This culvert design was designated the In-Chamber Longitudinal Culvert System (ILCS). An extensive research effort led to the development of the ILCS design. This paper provides a brief summary of the research results and the accompanying design guidance developed for low to medium lift ILCS locks. The guidance includes culvert location; port size, location, and spacing; port extensions; culvert-roof overhang; and wall baffles.

The ILCS is a feasible design based on the hydraulic performance determined from the investigation.",2004
Precast concrete (PC) pavement tests on Taxiway D-D at Laguardia Airport,,,"The use of precast concrete (PC) to rehabilitate pavement is gaining interest as roadways and taxiways become more congested and the amount time of provided to rehabilitate pavements has been reduced greatly. PC is believed to provide a durable pavement, which can be constructed during reduced work periods. Congested airports, that move passengers by day, and cargo by night, are good candidates for PC pavement. The Port Authority of NY and NJ, which operates John F. Kennedy International (JFK), LaGuardia (LGA), and Newark Liberty International (EWR) airports is familiar with tight time constraints for construction of pavement rehabilitation projects. In a continuing effort to identify a durable pavement that can be constructed within the allowable closure period, The Port Authority of NY and NJ installed a PC pavement test on Taxiway D-D at LaGuardia Airport during September of 2002. The PC pavement test was installed over an existing asphalt concrete (flexible) pavement. Two systems were developed and constructed. One system (System B) consisted of 30.5 m (100 feet) by 15.25 m (50 feet) area of 406 mm (16 inch) thick conventionally reinforced precast concrete. The other system (System A) consisted of 30.5 in (100 feet) by 15.25 m (50 feet) area of 304 mm (12 inch) thick pre-tensioned PC. All panels in both systems were sized at 3.8 m (12.5 feet) by 7.6 m (25 feet). Dowels were used for load transfer.

A novel 2D MEMS-based optical crossconnect with greatly reduced complexity,optical switch; optical crossconnect (OXC); optical MEMS; micromirror; wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM); switching architecture,,"Optical crossconnects (OXCs) are critical core for provisioning and restoration in mesh wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) networks. An increasingly urgent need for large-port-count OXCs severely challenges the current existing OXC technologies. To reduce the crosspoint complexity, we propose an architecture based on 2 x 2 switching fabrics by integrating the general symmetric (GS) architecture with Clos and Benes switching architectures together. Rearrangeably and strictly nonblocking structures are examined as well as the control algorithm of the rearrangeably nonblocking structure is studied. Then, we present two basic switching fabrics of the simplest 2 x 2 bidirectional OXC utilizing 2D optical MEMS, one of which is used as the basic building block in our proposed architecture to construct needed OXCs. The concrete optical MEMS-based Benes switch with our proposed architecture is studied. The resulted switch requires (N/2) x [log(2)(N/2)] x (log(2)N-1/2) micromirrors, while the switch based on GS architecture needs 2(N/2)2 micromirrors. It is very clear that our proposed architecture reduces the number of micromirrors greatly, especially when N is large. Moreover, theoretical analyses have shown that the resulted switch has the same insertion loss, lower power consumption, and better performance of port-to-port repeatability, comparing to the conventional crossbar switch.",2004
Evolution of deep foundation systems used at the Port Ivory Intermodal Facility site; 1906-2004,,,"The Howland Hook Terminal Facility located in Staten Island, New York is one of the most active container terminals in the Northeast United States. Due to the high capacity of the facility, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ) recently acquired the adjacent 37-acre Port Ivory Facility. Expansion of this Site facilitates the additional transfer of goods for rail transport, where formerly the facility was solely highway transport. Upon completion, the facility will have the ability to transfer containers directly to a freight rail line onsite by crossing from Howland Hook Site to the Port Ivory Site via a proposed bridge over Bridge Creek. The geology of the Port Ivory Site consists of shallow glacial deposits left by the leading edge of the last advance of the Wisconsin Glacier. Glacial and marine action over the millennia and the modifications of past construction combined to form a challenging site geologically. Prior to the PANYNJ acquiring the site, the Port Ivory Facility was occupied by Proctor and Gamble for nearly 100 years. Over the course of time, the site has had a variety of structures constructed and demolished at the site. The earliest structures were often supported on shallow foundations and the foundation types used progressed over the years transitioning from low capacity timber piles to various new pile types as they became available; such as Raymond tapered piles, steel piles with concrete cores, precast piles and cast in place foundations. Currently, we are designing 4-foot diameter high capacity drilled shafts to support a new bridge over Bridge Creek to connect the two sites. Drilled shafts proved to be a very economical solution from both a design and construction point of view to carry the axial load of the bridge of approximately 400 tons per shaft. The paper will present a historical evolution of the progress of deep foundation types used at the Port Ivory Site; from low capacity timber piles to high capacity large diameter drilled shafts. The paper will also present changes and modifications of geotechnical design criteria over time that affects the type of deep foundations used. For instance, utilizing new seismic design criteria requires selecting a deep foundation system that withstands seismic loading conditions and overcomes the effects of liquefaction.",2004
Anchored pile foundations in British Columbia,,,"Anchored steel pipe piles are being used more frequently in British Columbia for shoreline projects such as public ferries, cruise ship docks, containership terminals and locally in the expansion of the Vancouver waterfront convention center. While a 36"" diameter driven pile may provide adequate compression loads it will not always achieve enough penetration to provide the required tension loading. That is why bundles of threaded anchors or strands are drilled through the center, past the pile tip, and anchored into the underlying strata. Drilling up to 250 feet deep through the piles in variable water bearing strata presents challenges. Southwest Contacting Ltd. (SWC) recently completed the three largest anchored pile projects in BC; Vancouver Port and Convention Center Expansion, Vanterm Container Terminal and the new Prince Rupert Cruise Ship Terminal. This paper will present the separate challenges encountered drilling the anchors. At Prince Rupert, the recently completed Northland Cruise Ship Dock ultimately required a cased system to drill and install triple thread bar anchors. When 200 foot long steel pipe piling was unable to penetrate the highly fractured gneiss/schist bedrock to obtain a seal and consolidation grouting was unsuccessful, a modified cased system was advanced deep enough into the rock to eventually seal. The 3420 bars were changed to 12-strands since the bars wouldn't fit through the smaller cased hole. The options were limited because each dolphin only had enough room for a small hydraulic drill rig that wouldn't have the power to fully case the holes. The Canada Place Pier Extension in Vancouver's Harbor led to the development of an innovative tip design used later at Vanterm. The 36"" diameter steel pipe piles were driven closed end but modified to permit drilling through a concrete plug at the base. The driving of the piles at Canada Place often knocked out the plug so we were faced with 50 feet of sand up inside the pile when the drilling started. This led to discussions on how to safely remove the sand, solidify the tip, and continue drilling to get past the tip without undermining the pile. Finally, Vanterm Berth Extension was completed with a unique drilling system because the pile tips stopped in hydraulic sands, as opposed to the native till. We were faced with advancing the casing to the till without undermining the base of the pile. With 100 psi water pressure at the pile base after we broke through the concrete plug, the trick was to prevent charging the sand with our 250 psi air which liquefies it and forced it up our drill casing. And of course, it has to happen just before Christmas holidays!",2004

"Pile driving indicator program results, Pier 400 container wharf, Port of Los Angeles, California",,,"The largest single-user container terminal in North America was recently constructed on Pier 400 at the Port of Los Angeles. The terminal's 2,250-meter long wharf is supported by about 3,700 24-inch octagonal precast, prestressed concrete piles. The piles are about 35-meters long and were driven through between 3 and 16 meters of rock dike. A total of 55 piles were monitored during two indicator pile-driving programs to develop the appropriate pile driving criteria to obtain the required axial pile capacity. The pile driving indicator programs include: 1) data from two different size diesel hammers and one hydraulic hammer, 2) comparison of piles driven dry versus those driven with jetting, and 3) restrike data after several days, several weeks, and several months. The results of the indicator pile programs provide the opportunity to better appreciate: 1) the impacts on capacity and schedule, when the piles are jetted, 2) the validity of using short-term restrikes to evaluate the ultimate long-term capacity of the piles, and 3) the potential economic, schedule, and quality control advantages that can be obtained when a hydraulic hammer is used.",2004
Design of modified RED implemented in a class based CIOQ switch,,DEPLOYMENT; BUFFERS; QUEUE,"A Combined Input and Output Queued (CIOQ) switch with a certain speedup of S (1 < S < N) can achieve 100% throughput and offer QoS guarantees. In this paper, we present the deployment of Random Early Detection (RED) on a CIOQ switch that has priority queues with shared buffer (class based switch). We first give an estimated model to concrete that one RED controller per output port is sufficient for a CIOQ switch as long as the speedup is larger than two, and then we extend this conclusion to propose a class based CIOQ switch structure. Furthermore, we modify RED to propose two schemes based on such structure by adaptively setting RED parameters and introduce a dynamic priority queue scheduling scheme. The simulation results prove and demonstrate that our analysis is correct and the proposed algorithms can achieve high utilization and provide delay guarantees.",2004
Ground support design and analysis: Exchange Place Station Improvements,,,"The Exchange Place Station Improvements Project was one of three parts to the Port Authority of NY & NJ (PANYNJ) Downtown Restoration Program (DRP), which was implemented following the destruction of the World Trade Center (WTC) twin towers and the loss of commuter rail service to the Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) WTC Station. The project involved design and construction of six (6) new tunnel crossovers between five (5) existing 90-year-old concrete lined tunnels, and extending the existing station platforms approximately 46 m (150 ft) west. Design of this project involved excavating cavern spans upwards of 18 m (60 ft) in the underlying Manhattan Schist bedrock formation with rock cover as low as 7.5 m (25 ft) and multi-storey buildings directly above planned excavation limits. Design of ground support alternatives were completed using both review of historical precedents and UNWEDGE software analyses to evaluate load carrying capacities of various composite support systems. The design called for staged excavations with support installed at each stage. Ground support consisted of pre-stressed resin grouted rock bolts, pre-fabricated steel lattice girders and steel fiber reinforced shotcrete (SFRS) liner systems.",2004
Effects of variation in guarter-car simulation speed on international roughness index algorithm,,,"The international roughness index (IRI) is widely used throughout the world as a measure of road roughness. A quarter-car simulation at 80 km/h is performed on the longitudinal profile to compute IRI. Questions have been raised regarding the applicability of IRI for roads that are used at speeds above or below this simulation speed. To gain more insight into the effects of simulation speed, an investigation was carried out to determine how the roughness computed from the IRI model changes for different simulation speeds of the quarter car. This investigation was performed on an asphalt concrete data set and a jointed port-land cement concrete data set. For simulation speeds between 60 and 110 km/h, the response from the IRI model was within +/- 0.20 m/km of the IRI for 80% of the asphalt sections and 61% of the concrete sections used in the study. Although the output from the quarter-car model for the different simulation speeds was different from the IRI (simulation speed of 80 km/h), it is unclear to what extent a user's perception of the roughness of a roadway changes with the speed of travel. If examples of roadways are found where the subjective opinion of roadway users of the roughness seems inconsistent with the IRI, it is recommended that the IRI model be used with the current speed limit of the roadway to examine whether the obtained output provides a better match with the opinion expressed by roadway users.",2004
New navigation system in ports analysis,navigation systems; GPS transponders; ship's position; port infrastructur,,"New navigational systems in ports mainly used portable self powered GPS transponders, radio transmission and computers. A special software in the computer shows the pilot the current position, heading and speed of the ship. Furthermore, in computer is designed for receiving environmental data [1]. The GPS transponder transmits its data to the pilot computer unit and this data can in normal conditions be seen in few miles away. This could be a dedicated shore mounting station equipped with a UHF radio receivers [1, 2]. Analysis of navigational systems can assist select main advantages and disadvantages of the different systems and finally assist for the Authorities to choose best one for the concrete tasks.",2004
Network resource management: From H.323 to SIP,,,"IP Telephony has become a hot topic in the last few years. There are currently 2 major protocols for signaling IP telephony, namely SIP and H.323. The first version of H.323 has been published in 1996, whereas SIP is much younger. Since it is probable that both signalization protocols will coexist for a certain time, there is a need to port existing H.323 systems into a SIP environment. We propose in this paper a solution for porting a Quality of Service Architecture, namely the Resource Management Architecture, from H.323 to SIP. As an introduction, we provide a short overview of both protocols H.323 and SIP focusing on the call setup procedure and the capability exchange process. We then propose a solution for this concrete problem as well as technical possibility for implementing the porting of the architecture from H.323 to SIP.",2004
Trajectory tracking control of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems via generalized canonical transformations,nonlinear control; physical models; tracking systems,PASSIVITY-BASED CONTROL; CONTROLLED LAGRANGIANS; STABILIZATION,"This paper addresses trajectory tracking control of port-controlled Hamiltonian systems via generalized canonical transformations and passivity-based control. The main strategy adopted in this paper is to construct an error system, which describes the dynamics of the tracking error, by a passive port-controlled Hamiltonian system. After obtaining the error system, tracking control of the original system can be achieved by stabilizing the error system via passivity-based approach. First, a fundamental framework is provided for constructing the error system via generalized canonical transformations. Then a concrete design procedure is derived for a class of electro-mechanical systems. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a magnetic levitation system and laboratory experiments demonstrate its effectiveness. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2003
Measurement of radiation skyshine with D-T neutron source,skyshine; D-T neutron; FNS; MCNP-4B,NUCLEAR-FACILITIES,The D-T neutron skyshine experiments have been carried out at the Fusion Neutronics Source (FNS) of JAERI with the neutron yield of similar to 1.7 x 10(11) n/s. The concrete thickness of the roof and the wall of a FNS target room are 1.15 and 2 in. respectively. The FNS skyshine port with a size of 0.9 x 0.9 m(2) was open during the experimental period. The radiation dose rate outside the target room was measured a maximum distance of 550 in from the D-T target point with a spherical rem-counter. Secondary gamma-rays were measured with high purity Ge detectors and NaI scintillation counters. The highest neutron dose was about 9 x 10(-22) Sv/(source neutron) at a distance of 30 in from the D-T target point and the dose rate was attenuated to 4 x 10(-24) Sv/(source neutron) at a distance of 550 in. The measured neutron dose distribution was analyzed with Monte Carlo code MCNP-4B and a simple line source model. The MCNP calculation overestimates the neutron dose in the distance range larger than 230 m. The line source model agrees well with the experimental results within the distance of 350 m.

Structure of the artificial hard substrate assemblages in ports in Thermaikos Gulf (North Aegean Sea),hard substrate; ports; pollution; Polychaeta; trophic relations,COMMUNITIES; POLLUTION; COAST; FRANCE,"The present study describes the hard substrate assemblages established on the concrete blocks of three ports placed in gradually longer distances from the main source of pollution in Thermaikos Gulf. The samplings were performed on a seasonal basis for a 2-year period. The data analysis indicates a clear separation of the assemblages from each port. Evenness and Shannon-Weaver diversity indices were calculated and their values were found to be quite high. This fact, combined with the seasonal pattern that these assemblages hold, reveals stability and a good adaptation of their faunistic components to local environmental conditions. A change due to the construction of a new block functioning as a surge barrier was detectable at the station of N. Michaniona. Once again, biomonitoring proves to be essential in order to obtain useful information about the water conditions. Emphasis was laid on the taxa of Polychaeta by analyzing their numerical abundance and their feeding guilds separately. The results were very similar, a fact that supports the opinion that a specific taxonomic group can be used for the description and the monitoring in many different cases.

Smulation of a container transport system between port and inland terminal depots,container terminal; inter-modal transport; traffic control; line management system; host computer; shuttle; real-time simulation; rail; swap area,,"This document describes the development of a simulation of an automated container transport system that connects a harbour terminal and an inland depot with dedicated railways. The simulation has been developed as part of the European project ASAPPOne (Intelligent Shuttle Fleet Connecting Split Sea And Inland Container Storage Areas), of which IKERLAN is a partner. The aim of the ASAPPOne project is the automation of container transport tasks between container terminals (front/end areas). It consists of a fleet of shuttles, which run in convoy mode on train rail tracks along the connecting path and autonomously on a flat surface of coated concrete in the front/end areas. A Traffic Control System (TCS) receives container transport commands from a Host Computer and calculates the route for each shuttle inside the terminal. Along the railway. a Line Management System (LMS) calculates the route for each convoy of shuttles. In order to test and refine the Traffic Controller and the Line Management System, a simulation of all the elements that interact with it (cranes, shuttles, crossing controllers, swap areas, Host Computer) has been designed and developed.",2003
A new efficient equivalent circuit extraction method for multi-port high speed package using multi-input multi-output transmission matrix and polynomial curve fitting,,,"Modem high-speed integrated circuits for multi-gigabit applications require high-density packages with several hundred I/O pins, which also require a wideband circuit mode of package. Since a wideband model of a multi-port network is generally calculated by a full-wave field solver and given in the form of a scattering parameter, a SPICE-compatible circuit model must be extracted from a scattering matrix. We present the concrete maxtrix formulation for tranforming scattering parameter to transmission matrix for a 2N-port network. This transformation results in a new efficient equivalent circuit extraction method, which conveniently incorporates accurate electromagnetic models of an interconnecting structure including electronic package into a circuit simulator. By using this new extraction method, we can easily determine the valid bandwidth of an equivalent circuit model.",2003
"Full scale load tests of Canada Place Pier, Vancouver",cracks; cruise terminal; load tests; piles; repair; settlement; structural,,"The pier supporting Canada Place Cruise Terminal in Vancouver, British Columbia was constructed in the 1920s. Repairs and upgrading of the reinforced concrete structure were completed in the early 1980s for the 1986 World Expo, to provide hotel and convention centre facilities and a terminal for cruise ships. Since 2000, the Port of Vancouver has undertaken major renovations and expansion to increase the capacity of the facility and meet demands of the expanding cruise ship market. The extension to the existing pier added a third berth and provided additional passenger handling facilities. The expansion required the aprons of the original deck to carry wheel and outrigger pad loads in excess of load ratings previously in use. In the absence of detailed drawings, design data and material specifications to allow assessment of the load carrying capacity of the original structure, full scale structural load tests were performed in accordance with Canadian Standards Association CAN/CSA-A23.3 procedures. All thirteen tests were successful, confirming adequacy of the structure to carry the new loads. This paper presents the structural parameters, methodology and results of the test load programme.",2003
North Breakwater in Otaru Port,,,"North Breakwater in Otaru Port is Japan's first full-fledged concrete block breakwater faced to outer sea and has total extension length 1,289 in. Investigation, planning, designing and construction of this breakwater were carried out under the initiative of Dr. Isami Hiroi. This breakwater was put into construction in 1897 and completed in 1908.

Pile foundation construction for North Port Berths 12 & 13 at Port Klang,,,"The reconstruction of Berths 12 and 13 at Port Klang, Malaysia into multi-purpose container berths is a major upgrading exercise. The reconstruction of these wharves involves the systematic demolition of the existing wharf structure. This is then followed by installation of new piles and a new reinforced concrete deck slab. The soft sediments accumulated beneath the existing wharves render significant geotechnical risks with regards to the stability of the sediment mound and its effect on the structure and the adjacent berths. Early studies indicated that the sensitivity of the soft sediments would become predominant factors when considering pile installation works within the sediment mound. This paper describes the geotechnical risks attached to the project and the steps taken to mitigate these risks during the construction of the foundations for the new structures.",2003
The multiple use of sprinkler systems in the Betuweroute tunnels from a civil engineering perspective,,,"The Dutch ""Safety Concept Railroad Tunnels exclusively for Freight Transport"" published in 1997 sets requirements for all safety issues for the tunnels on the Betuweroute, the new railroad from the port of Rotterdam to the German border. Preventing and battling an accident with a LPG tanker wagon with a fire load of 300 MW followed by an explosion is one of prescribed design goals of the tunnel protection systems. In the preliminary design the tunnel was to be protected by fire resistant cladding, thus meeting the requirements for the road traffic tunnels of the Ministry of Transport. The only way to fulfill the Safety Concept was to install a deluge sprinkler system over the full length of the Bctuweroute tunnels. This paper describes the possibilities offered by the sprinkler system for canceling the fire-resistant cladding. By using the back throw of the sprinkler it is possible to prevent concrete damage in the sprinkler sections. By using the extra sprinklers sections next to the fire section the air temperature can be cooled down to a level where no spalling or damage will occur.",2003
"Discourse, agency and the question of evil",,,"This paper addresses the question of evil from an ethical and discourse-analytical perspective, taking Joan Copjec's commentary on Kant's notion of,radical evil' and its relation to human freedom as its point of departure. Specifically, Copjec's argument, that for Kant (and, one may add, for Lacan) the subject is always 'in excess of itself, provides an important foil for, or corrective to what may seem to be the upshot of Foucault's notion of discourse (its heuristic value notwithstanding). The latter entails that, insofar as the subject is ineluctably discursively constructed, its actions could be understood as being 'determined' by the discursive structure of (its) subjectivity. That is, the subject as agent may seem to lack volitional freedom in the sense that it is merely an instrument of a certain discourse by which it is 'spoken'. However, Kant's idea of 'radical evil', it is further argued, presupposes that the subject is free, in other words, that it always exceeds itself. In Foucault's terms, this would mean that the subject of discourse is able to adopt a counter-discursive position - something Foucault sometimes seems to make room for. What Kant calls 'radical evil' may be understood as something that occurs in the world through human agency, in the face of the possibility of an alternative course of action; that is, it is chosen - even if we only know this in retrospect through the phenomenon of guilt. If, in contrast, it is understood as being 'diabolical' in the sense of being unavoidably and irresistibly part and parcel of human 'nature', no one could condemn it in moral terms. This line of thinking is fleshed out, or given concrete significance by means of a discourse-analysis of documents pertaining to the so-called 'ripper-rapist' (criminal) case in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, in the mid-1990s.",2003
Hydrodynamic forces on concrete sea wall and breakwater during earthquakes: effects of bottom sediment layers and back-fill soil,hydrodynamic pressures; coastal structure; porous medium; sediment; seismic effect; earthquakes,DAM; PRESSURE; WATER; BED,"The objective of this paper is to present the effect of sediment characteristics on the dynamic response of sea walls and breakwaters during earthquakes. A finite-difference method is used to calculate the earthquake-induced hydrodynamic pressures of seawater and the pore water in seabed sediment. The water-filled soil mixture is used to model sediment and back-fill soil. The dynamic response of a rigid coastal structure induced by constant ground acceleration is studied, using variable sediment depths and porosity. The dynamic characteristics of the water-embankment-sediment system are investigated, applying four earthquake-re cords as exciting forces. The result of a quay-walled caisson demonstrates the significance of the seismic-induced dynamic force and the seismic effects should be considered for the design of coastal structures in seismic zone. The damaged wharves of Taichung Port during Chi-Chi earthquake, 21 September 1999 is also reported in the paper. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",2002

Method for calculating the transmission loss of a radio-wave-shielding wall,radio wave; concrete; electromagnetic shielding; wireless LAN; EMI,,"Radio-wave-shielding walls and floors made entirely of high-dielectric-loss material are being developed. It is necessary to determine the theoretical shielding characteristics of a shielding wall that requires a certain thickness. However it has previously been impossible to easily analyze walls composed of several layers and reinforcing meshes by an impedance method. Using equivalent distributed constant circuits and equivalent two-port networks, we have analyzed the characteristics of a radio-wave-shielding wall having an arbitrary number of material layers to an arbitrary polarization and radio frequency wave. As a result, we have derived expressions for theoretically calculating radio wave transmission loss of a wall. This paper describes the analytical method and a calculation example of a shielding wall developed by our company.",2002
"The development of a breakwater design at Caleta la Mision Port, Argentina",,,"The new generation of Concrete Armouring Units, CORE-LOC(TM), as a single layer armour has been in use for less than a decade with only a handful of breakwaters built. CORE-LOCs have been subjected by researchers and designers to stability tests. There are however still many possibilities for the use of CORE-LOCs in design to be covered and verified by physical modelling. This work deals with design of the Caleta La Mision Breakwater, Argentina, and presents the conclusions from the design process supported by extensive physical model testing in both wave flume and basin for verification and optimisation. CORE-LOC units have been employed in armouring the breakwater in many different arrangements and combinations. The breakwater is very exposed with a design wave of, Hs = 7.5 m, situated on a reef at level 0.0 m and slightly above. The site has about 9.0 m tidal range, so the breakwater toe is dry at low tide. The paper deals with the design of the front face, special toe hold blocks, overtopping and rear side stability as well as special roundhead features. On the reclamation behind the structure special trench for drainage of overtopping water was introduced as special structural element.",2002
Mobile code in .NET: A porting experience,,,"Mobile code systems typically rely on the Java language, since it provides many of, the necessary building blocks. Nevertheless, Microsoft recently released the NET platform, which includes at its core a virtual machine supporting multi-language programming, and a new language called C#. The competition between NET and Java is evident, and so are the analogies between these two technologies. From the point of view of code mobility, a natural question to ask is then whether NET supports mobile code, and how the mechanisms provided compare with those available in Java This paper aims at providing a preliminary set of answers to this simple question. The work we report about was not driven by the goal of providing a thorough comparison. Instead, it was driven by the practical need to port an existing toolkit for code mobility written in Java, muCODE, to the. NET environment. This approach forced us to verify our mobile code design on a concrete example, rather than bust think about the problem in abstract. The resulting software artifact constitutes, to the best of our knowledge, the first implementation of a mobile code system written for NET. In the paper, we provide an overview of the NET mechanisms supporting mobile code, show how they are exploited in our port, and discuss similarities and differences with the Java platform.",2002
Perceptions of new and established waterfront materials: US port authorities and engineering consulting firms,decking; fendering; perceptions; product/market development; end-users; specifiers; composites,ADOPTION; WOOD; INDUSTRY; COMPOSITES; TECHNOLOGY; PRODUCTS; MARKETS,"A demand exists for strong, cost-effective, durable, and environmentally benign building materials for weather-exposed infrastructure applications. In particular, port authority officials and engineers are seeking waterfront materials with a combination of ""ideal"" attributes that may not be currently available in the marketplace. Materials science advancements related to composite technologies arc ongoing, and composite product lines for waterfront applications are expanding. This paper examines the perceptions of U.S. port authorities and engineering consulting firms regarding new and established water-front materials in decking and fendering system applications. The findings from a nationwide survey indicate that the most important decking material attribute for U.S. port authorities and engineering consultants was reliable strength, followed by resistance to impact, resistance to decay, and low life cycle cost. The most important fendering material attribute for these two respondent groups was resistance to impact followed by high energy absorption, reliable strength, and structural design flexibility. The least important attribute for both decking and fendering was use of recycled materials. Material performance comparisons generally indicated a strong preference for concrete decking and steel fendering; composites were perceived as intermediate for both applications. In terms of cost, wood was perceived as the best; composites were perceived as the worst. Knowledge ratings of composite products and the receptivity to new technologies indicated that responding engineering consultants perceived themselves to be both more knowledgeable about composite materials and more progressive in the adoption of new technologies as compared to this study's port authority respondents.",2002
Repair of a chemical industry jetty in Aqaba - Jordan,,CONCRETE; CORROSION; CRACKING; STEEL,"The paper presents the results of a two-year work on the inspection, testing and repair of a jetty in the port of Aqaba in Jordan. The jetty was found in a moderately to severely deteriorated state seventeen years after construction. Chloride attack in the splash zone and chemical attack in the deck were diagnosed. Petrographic analysis of concrete in the deck revealed signs of sulfate attack. This was correlated with the chemicals handed on the berth. A comprehensive repair plan was devised and executed with the use of PC blended with GGBS together with pore blockers in the splash zone. The stage was set to monitor the repair works including a location where a variation on the pore blocker in the form of calcium nitrite was introduced.",2001
Estimating remaining life of airfieId pavements,,,"Currently, there is no universally accepted procedure or approach to performing remaining life analyses for airfield pavements. However, there are several methods that have been employed to estimate the remaining life of airfield pavements, each with advantages and limitations. Ail-port managers and engineers understand the importance and significance of this concept, and are increasingly interested in seeing reported some measure of remaining life as a part of pavement management and evaluation projects. This paper describes in detail several different approaches that are used to estimate the remaining life of airfield pavements (both bituminous- and concrete-surfaced). These include a design-based or traffic-based approach, a PCI approach, and a mechanistic-empirical analysis approach. The advantages and disadvantages of each approach are discussed. Although it is acknowledged that estimating remaining life is not an exact science, and that the chances of obtaining the same result from different approaches is slight, the information obtained from such analyses is extremely useful as part of an overall evaluation of an airport's pavements, as well as in planning and programming pavement rehabilitation activities.",2001
Design of Route 895 bridge over James River in Virginia,,,"The Route 895 bridge over the James River in Virginia will be a 1453-m (4,766-ft) long design-build river crossing directly downstream from the Port of Richmond. The highway will have two three-lane roadways in either direction at the James River crossing. East and west approach spans consist of two precast segmental concrete box girders connected by a longitudinal cast-in-place construction joint supported by single circular column piers with hammerhead pier caps. The east approach span segments are erected in cantilever from the piers using ground-based cranes, whereas the west approach is erected using overhead methods because of access limitations beneath the bridge. The main span superstructure will be a two-celled cast-in-place segmental box girder supported by twin-walled piers at the river crossing and single-walled piers at all other locations. The eastbound river crossing span arrangement is 115, 205, and 124 in (377, 672, and 406 ft), and the westbound river crossing spans are 75, 129, 205, and 118 in (246, 423, 672, and 388 ft).

The seismic modeling of sheet pile bulkheads for waterfront applications,,,"FLAC was used to design sheet pile bulkhead waterfront structures for the Carmel Port expansion project in Haifa, Israel. The authors estimated the seismic performance of the sheet pile bulkheads and performed sensitivity analyses of geometry, soil properties, and structural properties using FLAC. The bulkhead consists of a sheet pile wall retaining 18.7 m of fill, and tied back to a continuous sheet pile anchor. Cast-in-place concrete piles support the container crane rails and are tied together with a concrete strut. The site is in a region of moderate seismicity with potentially liquefiable sands existing at the site. Therefore, a custom constitutive model was used to model seismically generated pore pressures. This paper presents the modeling details, including soil and structural properties; model specifics; the summary of a seismic validation; the results of the analyses; and a discussion on the lessons learned from using FLAC for such an application.",2001
Harbor works perfomance to underestimated wave heights and the size of modern ships,inspection and maintenance of harbor works; underestimated wave height; deformation of the armor; undermining of the seawall's foundation; underwater investigation,,"Inspection and maintenance of harbor works are essential in order to reassure port's operation, most significant for any island. The port of Heraklion city located at northern Crete Island, South Aegean Sea, Greece, is one of the greatest harbors of Greece, servicing much of the island's sea transportation. It has been formed in stages during the 20th century by a breakwater, partly armored with tetrapodes experiencing extreme waves of about 6.00 in. high, not complying with the design wave of 5.00 m. high. Ground survey as well as underwater inspection using a Remote Operated Vehicle prove damages of tetrapodes and sections' deformation of the armor. Since Heraklion harbor nowadays has to service bigger ships than ever before, there were severe indications that undermining of the seawalls foundation was going on Thus, the port authorities' engineers decided to have under-water investigation of the seawall between Dock I and Dock 11, where a sewage pipe was flown. Even though the sea was very dirty, with the help of the spotlights of the Remote Operated Vechicle (R.O.V.) system, the image transmitted from the camera was clear enough and very helpful to investigate the situation. The seawall foundation was found to be extensively eroded to the point that some column of concrete blocks just stood in place because of the friction between them. The underwater inspection was proved to be most helpful to the authorities' engineers since they can guide the surveillance in real time as they were diving themselves, recording everything for later investigation. The performance of the armor's tetrapodes seems to be very much alike stones under the same situation.",2001
"California's interstate-710 rehabilitation: Mix and structural section designs, construction specifications",full depth AC; rehabilitation; AC overlay; longer life pavements; structural design,,"In California, as elsewhere in the United States and overseas, the necessity to design and construct asphalt pavement structures which exhibit service lives greater than the approximately 20 years, for which many pavements have been designed in the past, are major objectives of organizations both public and private. This paper presents the results of both mix and structural designs for a full-depth asphalt concrete (AC) replacement structure and an AC overlay on a cracked and seated portland cement concrete (PCC) pavement. These designs have been developed for a major facility in the Los Angeles area, the Interstate-710 freeway from the Port of Long Beach, California, inland to the cast. For the fall-depth AC replacement structures, required in order to increase clearances between the freeway and the overcrossings, both mix and structural design methodology are described. Thickness for the asphalt concrete structure on the cracked and seated PCC pavement is based on the consideration of the influence of reflection cracking. Successful performance of the longer-life pavements requires strict attention to pavement construction. Discussion is directed to some changes to the current State of California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) specifications and construction practice to achieve this improved performance. The resulting designs represent the partnered effort between Caltrans, the Asphalt Industry in California, and the University of California, Berkeley, through the Longer Life Asphalt Pavement Task Group of the Pavement Design and Rehabilitation Committee (PDRC) of Caltrans.",2001

The quay construction with concrete caisson in Belde container port in Turkey,caisson; port; quay construction; transverse stability; stability of caisson,,"Belde port area is situated on the northeastern coast of the Marmara Sea, approximately 45 km east of Istanbul-Turkey. Belde port site is near to the industrial area around the Gebze in the district of Dilovasi, which is a town of Izmit. The Marmara Sea is almost completely enclosed, opening only to the Black Sea through the Bosphorus and to the Agean Sea through the Dardanelles. The Belde port overall of the site is approximately 53 hectares (ha) including land reclaimed from the sea. There are a number of existing relatively small jetties along the coastline adjacent to Belde. All of these jetties are unprotected and berthing for relatively small vessels. Design waves at Belde have been calculated from the wind record since there is no direct record of the wave climate at the port area. The calculation, which is the method given in the United States Corps of the Engineers, Shore Protection Manual, uses the open sea fetch and the hourly wind speed to predict the wave height and period. The quay structure will be constructed with concrete caisson in Belde container port. Casting and transporting of concrete caisson to the site and strength and bearing capacity of foundation soil have been discussed. In this paper, transverse stability, factor of safety for sliding and overturning, pressure under the foundation has been investigated. Briefly, the overall stability of the caissons has been studied as a part of the global slope stability analysis.",2001

Market globalization and technology transfer. How to promote and develop links in Romania,,SMALL FIRMS; INNOVATION; NETWORKS,"Market globalization is a vision and thought process as well as a structural process. Its impact is internal and external, and affects employees, customers and suppliers. Its fundamental percept is free flow of commerce, labour and capital, and belief in the ability of an individual to significantly and favourably impact larger and economic systems. This is a process that focuses a company's core competence on a single, worldwide market, creating growth and profit opportunities through synergies acid efficiencies in engineering, sales, purchasing and distribution. Globalization has a frenetic pace and is a dramatic force of worldwide supply and demand. Companies that adjust to its speed discover the force of change greatly in his favour, while those that cannot adjust, find that cannot escape or avoid the competitive forces created by this process. To be competitive in the context of economics globalization, companies need to be provided with the up-to-date technologies, and therefore innovation and technology transfer are strongly required to be at hand. Innovation-the creation of economic and social value through the development of new products and processes -needs to be embedded in all the segments of the economy, and the research results must be directed towards the market. Technology transfer - the transfer of the results of research from research community to the commercial sector - is the entry port of the new technologies to industry, and in doing this, it must overcome many obstacles before its outcomes can be successfully brought to market and be useful to economic and social life. As a factor that influences progress, technology transfer is one of the main drivers of economic growth in the giant economies. Innovation and technology transfer-the driving forces of radical transformation in business and economies worldwide-play a central role in pushing forward the planning for change among the research community, among policy makers and practitioners at national and regional level. Establishing priorities, laying out strategies, efficiently utilising research findings, and understanding the impact of economic globalization on science and technology, is essential elements for a successful global co-operation towards competitiveness. Sharing experiences, processes and methodologies are ideal vehicles for establishing transnational linkages as a catalyst for technology transfer partnerships between SMEs across borders. Technology transfer occurs in many ways-through the simple spoken word, through the physical transfer of a tangible product of research or through the relative complexity of intellectual property licensing programme, keeping professionals in the specific fields abreast of the latest developments. The globalization of Managerial Policy for Technology Transfer requires the achievement of a new balance between competition and co-operation. As far as Romanian enterprises are concerned, the interaction with the global market will help SMEs improve their competitiveness by assisting in the modernization of their operations, utilization of new technologies, and improvement of management, marketing, and business processes. As there is often a lack of well developed communication links with the industrial and commercial world, the report tries to deals with the concrete aspects on the promotion and the development of the links in Romania between research community and industry needs highlighting different mechanisms for technology commercialization in the context of market globalization.",2001
Statnamic load testing using water as reaction mass,,,"The following paper describes experiments performed in Hamilton, Canada, using water as reaction mass for Statnamic testing. These trial tests represented the first such tests performed in the world. These tests were performed in Lake Ontario, on a 323 mm diameter pipe pile driven in 8 m of water. The tests were performed using a 0.6 MN Statnamic device and hydraulic catching mechanism with a specially designed hanging structure from which a submerged steel container was used to contain a mass of water. The goal of the testing was to investigate the potential for using water to replace concrete and steel for use as reaction mass for Statnamic tests. This paper also describes Statnamic test results from the first two Statnamic testing contracts for the Port of Lake Charles, Lake Charles, Louisiana, USA. These jobs were performed by Applied Foundation Testing, Inc. of Green Cove Springs, Florida, USA. These tests were performed on square concrete piles, with test loads ranging From 4.0 MN to 5.0 MN. This paper also summarizes the theoretical research conducted by Middendorp and Courage in 1995, which influenced the design of the actual water reaction mass assemblies for the experimental, work of 1998.",2000
Extension of the Eastern breakwater in Malaga,,,"Dragados is participating in the construction of the 1200 m long eastern vertical breakwater for the Port of Malaga that will allow the future growth of this Spanish port. This job includes the following operations: dredging a trench down to a good foundation, dumping and filling the trench with 1.3 million cu.m, of mixed material protected by armour stone, levelling the mixed fill material in order to provide a flat support for the caissons, building, transporting and placing 30 concrete caissons of unusual size (42.65m x 21.12m x 21.5m.) and construction of the superstructure, including an internal edge beam. The new breakwater will be linked to the existing one by building a rubble mound breakwater and a wharf area prepared for port activities.",2000
Outline of new technical standard for port and harbour facilities in Japan,,,"Ministry of Transport in Japan newly notified the details of ministerial ordinance specifying standards for technology in port and harbour facilities in April 1999. Some new design concepts were introduced in the details for instance, a probabilistic approach as for the design of vertical breakwaters, a new method calculating minimum mass of armour stones and blocks on sloping breakwaters and protection blocks of composite breakwaters, seismic performance-based design for the structures with highest importance,seismic capacity design for wharf supported by vertical piles and application of limit state design to reinforced concrete members. On the other hand, the new technical standard for coastal protection facilities is being drawn up along with revision of Coastal Protection Act(enacted 1956).",2000
Large and small incrementally launched structures,,,"The technology for incrementally launched structures has been known for several decades. It had not been utilized in South Australia until a recent flurry of activity revealed that this method could be economically utilized for both small and large structures. Within 3 years, four structures of various sizes were constructed using the technique. A double-T prestressed concrete recreational jetty was incrementally launched at one of Adelaide's suburban beaches (Brighton Jetty). Twin single-cell prestressed concrete (PSC) box girders were incrementally launched over eight lanes of traffic at a busy signalized suburban road intersection without disruption to traffic (bridge over Port Wakefield Road). Two incrementally launched major bridges were constructed over the River Murray, Australia's longest river, The first structure consisted of steel girders composite with a reinforced concrete deck (Berri Bridge, 330 in long), and the other structure was a single PSC box girder (Blanchetown Bridge, 410 in long). All these structures are mentioned, but the focus is on the FISC box girder structures. Construction problems associated with the use of permanent bearings as launch bearings and the sensitivity of box girders to construction tolerances are discussed, and the lessons to be learned are presented. Finally, an unsuccessful attempt to monitor the long-term prestress of the Blanchetown Bridge using state-of-the-art optical fiber technology is discussed, including the reasons for its failure and possible improved future methodology.",2000
"Stability of concrete cubes in restoring horizontal composite breakwater at Mormugao Port, India",,,"The harbour has been formed by a breakwater in Mormugoa port has been constructed with a caisson formed by laterite concrete blocks placed on a rubble mound at low water level. The caisson sitting on the rubble mound experience forces due to severe waves and hence it is protected by wave breaker blocks on its seaward side, however, this solution was not satisfactory. Hence a detailed model investigation for strengthening the armour layer on the seaward side in order to protect the caisson against the onslaught of waves was carried out in a flume. The details of the modelling, experimental procedure and the results of the laboratory tests are presented and discussed in detail in this paper.",2000
Model solutions of concrete environment and effect of chloride ions on the electrochemical corrosion behavior of reinforcing mild steel,model solution; concrete environment; reinforcing steel; chloride effect; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS); polarization curves; SEM; EDAX,IRON,"Two model solution have been used in this study in order to simulate the corrosion behavior of mild steel rebars in the pore concrete environment. The first one is based on saturated calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)(2), pH 12.7+/- 2) and cement (port land Type I) extract solution(pH 12.7+/- 2) in open air, at room temperature (24+/- 1 degreesC). The effect of chloride ions (5g/l and 10g/l NaCl) was studied in both model solutions. Electrochemical techniques such as potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been performed in a classical three-electrode cell. Also additional information was obtained by SEM and EDAX analysis. It seems that there is a difference in the way each solution simulates the behavior of steel, because the passive films formed show dissimilar topography, composition and anticorrosion protectiveness. The presence of chloride ions allows one to see more clearly the difference between the model solutions and the way each one interacts with the reinforcing steel. In this case the cement solution provides a more protective film for the reinforcing steel.",2000
Estimation of chloride ingress into concrete in marine environment,,,"Reinforced concrete quay wall structures in Port of Koper (Slovenia) exhibited severe deterioration in less than two decades of service. The principal cause of deterioration is chloride-induced corrosion of the reinforcement. Construction related errors include insufficient concrete cover, elevated water-cement ratio and improper curing and compaction of the concrete mix. This is the result of inadequate quality control that did not fulfil the design requirements. Due to fast deterioration of the structure a renovation was carried out. It was based on the preliminary qualitative and quantitative analysis of its condition, which is also briefly presented. The analysis of chloride profiles on samples taken from different parts and elevations of 18-year-old quay wall structure was performed, The main purpose was to define sufficient concrete cover depth that would not result in visible damages today. The second purpose was to verify and to calibrate the mathematical model of chloride diffusion in the marine environment of Slovenian coast. The model is based on the 2(nd) Fick's law and is used to estimate the duration of initial phase of corrosion process. The results are presented as a typical chloride profile for each exposure zone, which is related to the exposure categories recognised in European Standard EN 206. The concept of environmental load and the importance of moisture conditions are explained for each zone. The paper also includes further subdivision into various classes of severity depending upon both macro and microclimate.",2000
Three dimensional soil-structure analysis of port-said east quay wall,,,"One of the deepest diaphragm wall structures built in soft clay, 62.5m deep below Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT), is designed to be used in the Port-Said East Harbor. The Quay wall platform having 35m width and 1200m long, is supported on series of four barrettes spaced 7m in the longitudinal direction. The four barrettes are connected in the transverse direction by 3x0.8m top beam. Each barrette is having 3x1m cross-section and extended 60m below sea level. The front barrette is a T-section extended to 34.5m below LAT level, forming a part of the front wall. The designed dredging level in front of the Quay wall is 18m below sea level. The finite element/finite difference program FLAC 3D is used to analyze the soil-structure interaction of the Quay Wall. The soil is modeled as a layered elasto-plastic media. The sequence of construction and subsequent loading conditions are simulated. The computed stresses are used in designing the reinforced concrete elements and the deformations are used to establish the structure serviceability limits.",2000
Case study for pile foundation damaged by soil liquefaction at inland site of artificial island,,,"Plumb measuring, television observation, and pile inclinometer survey are conducted for PHC piles (Prestressed High strength Concrete piles) supporting a two-story building that experienced severe tilt due to soil liquefaction of reclaimed fill on Port Island in the 1995 Hyogoken-Nambu earthquake. A pseudo-static analysis is conducted in which the ground displacement profile estimated by one-dimensional effective stress analysis is applied to the pile through p-y springs. It is shown that: (1) the piles suffer extensive damage, with a horizontal displacement of about 0.4 m at the pile head and with horizontal gaps at about 3 m below the pile cap, (2) the horizontal gaps of the piles occurred in the plane parallel to the major direction of the earthquake ground motion, while the residual lateral deformation of the piles within the liquefied reclaimed fill occurred in a different direction, (3) most of the cracks in the piles occurred in the liquefied reclaimed fill, and (4) the analytical results showed a good agreement with those obtained by field investigations.",1999
Terzaghi oration: Geotechnical aspects of the 1995 Kobe earthquake,,,"The background information is given on the issues such as earthquake-generating plate tectonics in the Japanese archipelago, historical seismicity and development of fault rupture in the region of strong shaking during the Kobe earthquake. The geological setting and topography are described together with the expansion of land reclamation in the port area of Kobe. Characteristics of the ground motions recorded at various sites during the earthquake are also presented. Soil conditions investigated at two sites by way of undisturbed sampling using the ground freezing technique are described somewhat in details. The gravel-containing silty sand called Masado was Identified to have developed liquefaction under intense shaking. The features of liquefaction and consequent lateral spreading which occurred in the reclaimed fills are presented In terms of attenuation characteristics of the lateral displacement of the ground diminishing with distance inland from the waterfront. As typical examples of the damage to foundations, results of in-site survey are presented on the injury of cast-in-place reinforced concrete piles of the bridge piers which were investigated by the pile integrity test and visual observation using the borehole camera. It was found that the major injury such as crack development had occur at the pile head, at the portion of soil stiffness discontinuity between liquefied and unliquefied layers, and also at the portion of discontinuity In stiffness of pile body. Outcome of comprehensive investigations on the damage to foundations of LPG storage tanks is designed with emphasis of the behaviour of precast reinforced concrete piles. Lastly, simple analyses were made for the behaviour of piles undergoing lateral spreading. It was shown that, if piles were to move by an amount significantly larger than the surrounding soil deposit which was generally the case for the piles near the revetment lines, the stiffness of the soils must be reduced drastically when attempting to represent the soil-pile interaction behaviour by the spring model.",1999
"Blasting to the rescue, underwater concrete bridge-pier demolition",,,A highway bridge demolition project to allow shipping access to a new container port in Puget Sound ran into trouble when contract-stipulated mechanical means of demolition failed.

Reinforced soil for bridge support applications on low-volume roads,,,"A quick and simple method of bridge substructure construction using geosynthetic reinforced soil (GRS) is illustrated. GRS is used to build abutments and pier foundations for simple bridges. It is a refinement of existing reinforced soil technology used during the last 20 years. The interaction of a closely spaced geosynthetic reinforced soil system and the reasons why conventional design methods are not appropriate for these closely spaced systems are explained. This method is not recommended for all bridge building assignments; for example, it is not suitable for construction of permanent bridges in scour zones. The technique is ideal for remote locations, inaccessible to use of concrete and other traditional materials. A generic style of GRS construction is explained to ensure performance and internal stability. Construction is rapid with conventional equipment. The materials are common, inexpensive, and generally available. An overview of recent full-scale research is provided. The results of two full-scale prototype tests are presented to demonstrate performance and limitations and to confirm the design of such systems. A case history is presented that shows the versatility of the technology in a bridge sup port application. A procedure for prestraining or preloading the reinforced soil to enhance performance is provided. For bridge support applications, preloading of the GRS has the benefit of limiting postconstruction creep settlement. Preloading also proof-tests the structure and verifies the quality of construction. Additional sketches are included to show its potential for common applications. A brief discussion about design considerations to limit potential problems is offered.",1999
Cause and mode of action of the alkali-silica reaction in concretes made with Estonian Portland oil shale cement,,,"The alkali content of burnt Estonian oil shale is very high, with an Na2O equivalent of over 3 %. The Port land oil shale cement produced from it has art Na2O equivalent of 1.5 to 2.0%. Checks were therefore made at Tallinn Technical University to find how the relatively high alkali content affects the durability of concrete made from aggregate with alkali-sensitive constituents, e.g. igneous rock and chalcedony. The investigations were carried out using the procedures in ASTM C 227-58T The effect of the alkali reaction was assessed by the expansion of the test pieces. The dynamic modulus of elasticity in flexion was also measured, and the changes in the concrete were followed using a microscope. From the results of the investigation it emerged that a harmful alkali-silica reaction does not occur if the proportion of burnt oil shale in the Portland oil shale cement is at least 25 %. Active components in the burnt oil shale which reduce or prevent the harmful alkali-silica reaction are the glassy fraction, which is present in the form of very fine-grained spherical particles, and the acid-insoluble fraction which consists predominantly of ultra-fine-grained quartz.",1999
PCC airfield pavement response during thaw-weakening periods,,,"A field study was performed at two regional airports in Wisconsin during spring thaw to determine its effects on portland cement concrete (PCC) ah-port pavements. This study was part of a research program to model the performance of airfield pavements for the Federal Aviation Administration. Subsurface temperature and falling weight deflection measurements of the pavement structures were taken at both airports and used to calculate the frost penetration depths, the changes in bearing capacity, and the joint and load transfer efficiencies. This paper summarizes the findings of this study and includes several relationships between various engineering properties of the subsurface layers below the PCC layer, along with a procedure for evaluating pavement performance using falling weight deflection data for PCC pavements during spring thaw.",1998
Sunshine Skyway Bridge - 10 years later,,,"The Sunshine Skyway Bridge, opened to traffic in April 1997, is performing very well after 10 years in an aggressive environment. The 1,200' long precast segmental, cable-stayed balanced cantilever main span and 160' high precast and cast-in-place elliptical piers are withstanding the salt waters of Tamps Bay. The concrete, along with corrosion inhibitors, has proven to be worth its weight in gold. Recent inspection has provided results indicating that when proper techniques are incorporated into the design, precast concrete can resist the harsh effects of the environment. The Florida Department of Transportation's rigorous maintenance and inspection has unveiled only minor repairs after the initial 10 years of service. Maintenance costs over the last ten years have been minimal for a bridge of this size. Some costs have been associated with repairs of damage to concrete barriers from direct lightning strikes. Most repairs are not directly related to the concrete or cable stays, but to routine components of the bridge. For example, repairs were needed to the large modular expansion joints at the transition to the 135' span-by-span, twin precast segmental box approaches and the 4,000' main span unit. Cleaning and painting of the mechanical sliding pot bearings at this same location was also done. The initial three-coat paint system of the cable stays has endured the salt air and relentless rays of the sun, requiring only minor touch up paint around the welds and grout port locations. All maintenance has been relatively routine and minor. There is no evidence of any adverse conditions for the stays, their components or connections. The superstructure deck is behaving as expected, responding to annual temperature changes and showing no evidence of any unanticipated deflection - all indicating good behavior. A review of the extensive maintenance and testing over the past 10 years attests to the bridge's ability to withstand the fury of Mother Nature. This structure is a testimony to what has been accomplished and what the future may hold for the precast segmental and cable-stayed bridge industry.",1998

Long-life asphalt concrete pavement test program at John P. Kennedy Airport,,,"For an airport operator, asphalt concrete pavement prone to rutting and shoving under traffic is a very real problem. These conditions make snow removal difficult, permit water build-up on the pavement, results in a rough traveled way, and occasionally, impassable pavement. Initial solutions to this problem at the three airports operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey involved the use of very hard modified asphalts, which reduced rutting, but which aged relatively fast. These pavements required more frequent overlays and significantly higher maintenance costs than pavement using conventional asphalt cement. A long-life asphalt concrete pavement mix that is not prone to deformation is the goal of recent research.",1998
"Recovery of armour layer slopes on ""Principe de Asturias"" breakwater in the Port of Gijon, Spain",,,"Gijon is the leading bulk port in Spain. Located in the middle of the Cantabrian coast (Fig. 1), it discharges 10 million tonnes of iron ore and coal a year, mainly for the nearby steel plant. The ""Principe de Asturias"" is the main breakwater, protecting the port from the most severe storms and sheltering the bulk terminal, which is built against its final section. The cross-section is exceptional for a slope-type breakwater, with a core consisting of 90-tonne concrete blocks and outer layers made up of 120-tonne blocks, crowned with an L-shaped superstructure. From the completion the works in 1975, it was observed that blocks were being lost from the breakwater slope, changing its original shape and leaving the superstructure unprotected. This paper summarizes the works carried out to repair the slope, restoring its original cross-section.",1998
The application of side-scan sonar system in monitoring benthic artificial reefs,,,"The physical status of two types of cubic concrete artificial reefs was investigated by means of a side-scan sonar system on a testing site off Yung-an LNG port, south-western part of Taiwan. The ultimate goal of this investigation was intended to deduce the mechanisms which cause the excess subsidence of these reefs, and thereafter, to propose pertinent procedures in preventing this excess subsidence. After deployment, these reefs were monitored regularly. Based on their positions, these reefs could be recognized by three sets, i.e., set A, B and C. Very limited relative displacement of these reefs could be detected. The heights of the reefs were fairly constant for the first 5 months. However, a sudden height decrease of about 0.3m was detected for most of the reefs thereafter. This sudden height decrease event was closely correlated with the strong sea state caused by a storm. According to information obtained during a period of 10 months, the major factors influence the subsidence of these artificial reefs in this testing site were scouring effects. The side-scan sonar system illustrates extremely effectiveness in searching, positioning, and height measurement of benthic artificial reefs.",1998

Soil liquefaction effects observed in the Kobe earthquake of 1995,seismic engineering; geotechnical engineering; foundations,,"Extensive soil liquefaction was observed during the 1995 Kobe earthquake, creating damage to port and harbour facilities in Port Kobe, Liquefaction of fill materials on Port and Rokko Islands resulted in ground settlement of 20-50 cm, Lateral spreads caused many concrete caisson quay walls in the port to displace as much as 5 m seaward and subside 1-2 m, Some piles under warehouses near quay walls were found to be broken under the loads imposed by surrounding ground movements, On Port and Rokko Islands, the improved ground sites using the vibro-compaction method or the sand compaction piles method sustained less deformation and damage than did the adjacent ground, The fill materials used for Port and Rokko Islands consist of a wide range of soils, from gravel to silt, The comparison of the compiled laboratory data of liquefaction resistance of the fill to the estimated induced stresses by the earthquake indicates that the fill was likely to liquefy early in the earthquake.",1998
Corrosion failure of the rocky point viaduct,,,"The Rocky Point Viaduct, located near Port Orford, OR, was replaced after only 40 years of service. A beam from the original viaduct was studied in detail to determine the mechanisms contributing to severe corrosion damage to the structure. Results are presented from the delamination survey, potential and corrosion mapping, concrete chemistry, and concrete physical properties. The major cause of corrosion damage appears to have been the presence of both pre-existing and environmentally-delivered chlorides in the concrete.",1998
Comparing reactance one-port and notch filters for voltage and current harmonic reduction in non-linear distribution systems,,,Harmonic distortion in distribution systems has escalated in recent years due to the widespread use of different nonlinear and electronically switched loads. This paper deals with decreasing the harmonics in three-phase four-wire distribution systems loaded with different non-linear loads. Two approaches have been implemented in order to achieve the desired goal. The first is the utilization of a reactance one-port compensator and the second is the use of notch filters tuned at the prospective harmonics to be eliminated. A concrete example is given to demonstrate the differences between both methods. The harmonic analysis is carried out in the time-domain utilizing the EMTP package in order to accurately represent both system non-linearity and voltage dependency.,1998
Design and evaluation of a coaxial transmission line fixture to characterize portland cement concrete,concrete; NDT; coaxial transmission line,,"Electrical characterization of portland cement concrete (PCC) is necessary for reliable operation of many electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. Examples of such techniques include ground penetration radar (GPR). For that purpose, PCC specimens were cast, and their complex permittivity and magnetic permeability were measured over a wideband of frequencies (1 MHz to 10 GHz) using both time domain and frequency domain measurement techniques. As part of an ongoing research project, three set-ups to measure the dielectric properties of PCC were designed. The measurements are carried out over a frequency range of 0.1 MHz to 10 GHz. The three different set-ups are parallel plate capacitor (0.1 MHz-40 MHz), coaxial transmission line (0.1 GHz-1 GHz), and TEM horn antenna (0.5 GHz- 10 GHz). This paper discusses the development of the coaxial transmission line fixture. It was designed to allow the evaluation of large PCC specimens and obtain an average effect of PCC components. A time domain reflectometry (TDR) setup was used in the design of the fixture and in testing its performance. A calibration scheme was developed and used to calibrate the fixture. Using a two-port S-parameter model, the complex permittivity and magnetic permeability of the PCC specimens were evaluated by frequency domain measurement. Time domain measurement techniques were based on one-port S-parameter model. Evaluation of the set-up using especially molded PCC specimens showed that curing status can be detected at a lower frequency using the imaginary component of the relative permittivity.

The NUT system enables a graphical description of the task and ensures an automatic synthesis of computing programs. The computing procedures were implemented in a Sun station.",1997
Damage to man-made islands caused by the 1995 Hyogo-ken Nanbu earthquake,earthquake; man-made island; port facilities; soil liquefaction,,"On January 17, 1995, a severe earthquake struck Kobe City and surrounding regions. The earthquake catered extensive damage to building, lifeline systems transportation, and port facilities, including large-scale earth structures, e.g., man-made islands. All the piers on the man-made islands were damaged. The damage to the piers was mostly due to the lateral displacement of concrete caissons during the severe ground shaking Consequently, the apron fell down in the cave produced by the movement of the caisson. The lateral displacement of the concrete caissons was about 7 m at maximum, and the settlement of the apron pall was about 3 m at maximum. The settlement of breakwaters was in a range between 1 and 2 m. Some of the breakwaters sank into the sea. Liquefaction occurred in a wide area of Port Island, but we observed that most failures of the piers were not necessarily due to the liquefaction of the reclaimed materials.",1996

Sampling for recruits of Semibalanus cariosus on the intertidal concrete tetrapods at 21 fishing ports along the Kameda Peninsula, southern Hokkaido, Japan, was conducted at the end of the recruitment season in 1994 at three spatial scales: at each fishing port, separated by several km; at two sites at each fishing port, separated by several hundred m; and on three blocks at each site, separated by 1-2 m. At all spatial scales, recruitment intensity was independent of adult densities. Recruitment densities significantly varied within all spatial-scales, however, 85.6% of the total variances was estimated to be due to variation among ports. Such km-scale variation of recruitment intensities coincided with the hydrographic pattern of the direction of coastal current.",1996
Engineering properties of epoxy resins used as concrete adhesives,absorption; adhesives; bonding; creep tests; curing; joints (junctions); pullout tests; shear tests,,"Some mechanical properties of two commercial bulk-hardened epoxy adhesives were investigated to update and complement existing data on these materials. Results obtained in these tests indicated that cured epoxy adhesives possess five to eight times higher tensile and shear strength than port-land cement concrete and much-reduced Young's and shear moduli. The influence of curing temperature on the mechanical strength of the material was investigated by testing the strength of epoxies epoxies after curing at temperatures of 10, 20, and 40 C. Long-term tensile creep tests of epoxy adhesives subjected to different sustained stresses that were conducted indicated that bulk-hardened epoxies have creep strains of less than 0.04. Long-term water resistance of concrete-to-concrete adhesion joints was investigated by comparing bond strength after 135 days of water immersion with control samples. Tests showed that the effect of water on adhesion joints was significant. Long-term water absorption of epoxies that was measured indicated that cured epoxies possess long-term water absorption values between 1.2 and 1.4 percent. Bond strength of hardened-io-hardened concrete and hardened-to-wet concrete adhesion joints subjected to different curing times and temperatures Mere determined using a slant shear test. The bond strength of concrete-to-concrete joints made with these epoxies generally exceeded 10 MPa at 23 +/- 2 C and the effect of curing temperature and time on bond strengths was notable. Pullout tests to determine epoxy adhesion joints between portland cement concrete and deformed steel bars were also conducted and theoretical maximum adhesive bond stress, apparent adhesive bond stress, and pullout load-deformation were calculated. Results showed that the epoxies rested possess high pullout resistance and the higher deformation of the adhesive layers benefits concrete-to-epoxy-to-steel adhesion.",1996
Durability of concrete structures in marine environment,corrosion; reinforcement and carbonation constant,,"In India, construction is the biggest industry and concrete worth Rs.20,000 crores is being used annually, a major port in aggressive marine environment along the vast coast line and hence the loss to the economy due to premature deterioration of the structures is enormous. When tire structures are situated in marine environment with possible high chloride diffusion, the reinforcement becomes active when carbonation front reaches reinforcement. Carbonation time to reach reinforcement can be enhanced either by increasing cover thickness or by decreasing the carbonation constant. In this paper, structures in marine environment were analysed for quality of concrete, depth of carbonation, carbonation constant, alkalinity of concrete, depth of chloride penetration and chloride-hydroxide ratio. Attempts were made to correlate the effect of quality of concrete and cover thickness on the enhancement of service life of the structures, The paper also highlights the importance of preventive measures at the stage of design and construction like increase in concrete cover, quality of concrete and coatings to reinforcement.",1996
Non-linear finite element analysis of a reinforced concrete cooling tower shell,finite element method; non-linear analysis; reinforced concrete; shell structures; stress,,"Reinforced concrete (R/C) hyperbolic cooling towers are the largest thin-shell structures ever constructed. These towers stand more than 150m tall and have wall thicknesses of 0.20-0.25m. Therefore, these can be classified as thin-shell structures. Analyses the influences of both the reinforcing ratio and the tensile strength of the concrete on the strength of the R/C cooling tower shells. In the numerical analysis Port Gibson tower is adopted for the numerical model and the finite element method is applied to examine the non-linear behaviour of the cooling tower shells. From the load displacement curves the initial crack strength and the ultimate strength are determined. Also presents the stress redistribution processes and demonstrates the influences of these problems on the strength of the cooling tower shells.",1996

"SEASONAL AND ANNUAL VARIATION IN BROOD ATTENDANCE, PREY TYPE DELIVERED TO CHICKS, AND FORAGING PATTERNS OF MALE COMMON TERNS (STERNA-HIRUNDO)",,REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS; BREEDING PERFORMANCE; FRATERCULA-ARCTICA; SANDWICH TERNS; FEEDING RATES; PARENTAL CARE; LEAST TERNS; AGE; FOOD; BEHAVIOR,"The study took place over 2 years (1990 and 1991) on a concrete breakwater located 1 km offshore on Lake Erie near Port Colborne, Ontario. Ten male Common Tems (Sterna hirundo) in 1990 and 12 in 1991 were radio-tracked by boat or car during the chick-rearing stage. Concurrent behavioural observations of the radio-tagged birds and 23 additional control birds documented the time each sex spent away from or at the nest. The frequency and prey species/size composition of feeds to chicks were recorded. Individuals that carried transmitters had predictable foraging patterns. In peak- (clutch initiation in early May) and late-nesting males (clutch initiation in late June) intra-individual variability was low. Late-nesting males exhibited greater interindividual variability than peak-nesting males. Adults recaptured in 1991 exhibited similar foraging patterns to those they expressed in 1990. There were diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations in prey delivered to chicks. We suggest that these were due to the temperature tolerances of the prey, rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) and emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides), that controlled their vertical distribution in the water column, and to the presence of large schools of larval fish during the late nesting season.",1994
A SERVICE ACQUISITION MECHANISM FOR SERVER-BASED HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS,HETEROGENEOUS DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS; CLIENT-SERVER MODEL; CLIENT-SERVICE MODEL; SERVICE ACQUISITION MECHANISM; ATTRIBUTE-BASED NAMING; REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL; SERVER INTERFACE DIRECTORY SERVICE; AGENT PROCESS; FAULT TOLERANCE; OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING; LANGUAGE VENEER,COMMUNICATION,"This paper presents a mechanism that facilitates and enhances the use of independently administered remote network servers in the presence of server interface heterogeneity. The mechanism is designed under the client-service model, which extends the client-server model with an abstraction of service to decouple abstract server capabilities from concrete server interface specifics such as server interface binding protocols and the interface operation invocation protocols. The mechanism selects servers, accommodates server interface heterogeneity, and handles server access failures as per the abstract server capabilities desired by the client. It could return the identity of the server used for each service access invocation to facilitate billing, refining service specifications, and reporting server-specific errors. This paper also illustrates a C library interface to this mechanism, and describes a language veneer over the C programming language demonstrating bow a typed procedural language could be extended by a few language constructs to support the mechanism under the client-service model. In this language, server capabilities are referenced by abstract data type (ADT) objects, and are accessed by invoking the objects' interface operations using a call-by-value-result paradigm. This language veneer also makes it easier to port the client software across to systems that use different service specification schemes. Our work suggests that this mechanism facilitates the development, use, and maintenance of client and server software in large heterogeneous distributed systems comprising many autonomous servers. It also shows that the overhead of invoking remote server operations via the mechanism can be quite low.",1994
USE OF ETHYL CHLORIDE TOPICAL ANESTHETIC TO REDUCE PROCEDURAL PAIN IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY PATIENTS,ETHYL CHLORIDE; PAIN; TOPICAL ANESTHETIC; PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY PAIN; PROCEDURAL PAIN,MANAGEMENT,"Pediatric cancer patients often become anxious, agitated, combative, and uncooperative due to the pain or fear of pain during invasive procedures. Generally, it is not the actual administration of medicines that produces this reaction, but the fear of the needle stick itself. Increased education and implementation of coping mechanisms is often not enough to allay this fear. The tangible solution of using ethyl chloride, an anesthetic spray, before port sticks, lumbar punctures, and bone marrow aspirations, was instituted by the hematology-oncology clinic to determine if the pain, emotional trauma, and fear of cancer treatments could be reduced in oncology patients. Survey results on 60 patients and 60 parents/caretakers showed that when given the choice to use the spray or to refuse its use, 68% of the parents thought that the patient had more of a sense of control and, thus, involvement in their treatment. Seventy-eight percent of the patients reported experiencing less pain associated with procedures. Staff noted an increase in cooperation, less combativeness, and more compliance with treatment. Perceiving the child's discomfort diminished, 87% of the parents/caretakers report feeling less anxious and, therefore, more capable of being supportive to each other and their child. These results verified the staffs perceptions of the advantages of using this noninvasive anesthetic. Ethyl chloride is an easy, effective, concrete approach to reducing procedural pain in pediatric oncology patients.",1992

SYDNEY HARBOR TUNNEL - STRUCTURE OF THE IMMERSED TUBE SECTION (REPRINTED FROM PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH AUSTRALIAN TUNNELING CONFERENCE),,,"The immersed tube section of the Sydney Harbour Tunnel is just under 1 km long and comprises eight precast reinforced concrete units 120 m long, 26 m wide and 7.4 m high. Each unit has a mass of about 23,000 tonnes. The units are being constructed in a casting basin at Port Kembla, towed to Port Jackson, sunk and joined in a predredged trench, and then backfilled. This paper describes aspects of the design of the immersed tube section, including reasons for adopting the immersed tube concept; evaluation of alternative cross-sections and forms of construction; dredging, foundation and backfilling considerations; towing, sinking and joining considerations; and north and south cofferdam structures. The paper concludes that the immersed tube concept is a technically attractive tunnelling option and is particularly suited to estuarine crossings.",1991
