Sustainability of construction materials: Electrodialytic technology as a tool for mortars production,Electrodialytic technology; Mortars production; Secondary water resources; Circular economy,WASTE-WATER; CONCRETE; REMOVAL; SLUDGE,"The reduction of tap water consumption in all activity sectors, including the building industry, is crucial to the sustainability of water resources. Effluents from wastewater treatment plants have the potential to replace freshwater in the construction sector but they contain a critical mixture of impurities, which hampers their use in mortars production. In this work, the viability of using effluent as an alternative to potable water for the production of mortars, after electrodialytic treatment, was assessed. Electrodialytic technology (ED-T) is a proven technique for decontamination of porous and aqueous matrices. ED-T experiments were conducted with 500 mL of effluent for 6, 12 and 24 h, with a current intensity of 25 mA. The results showed that after ED-T 6 h, the removal efficiencies of critical components were above 85% of their initial concentrations. Mortar properties such as setting time, workability, flexural strength, compressive strength and morphology were obtained for 100% effluent and tap water/effluent mixtures (50:50) with and without ED-T pre-treatment. The mortars with the ED-T treated effluent showed similar initial setting times and workability, higher flexural and compressive strength compared to the mortars reference.",2019

Aiming to assess the magnitude of CO2 emissions associated with freeway infrastructure construction activities and identify primary emissions sources in mountainous area, this study firstly assessed life cycle CO2 emissions of an entire freeway project in mountainous area in China, including pavement, bridge, tunnel, intersection, traffic safety facilities and temporary works into the system boundary. The results show that CO2 emissions related to road segment are one magnitude lower than that of bridge and tunnel. In addition, negligence of intersection, traffic safety facilities and temporary works could underestimate 4% of total CO2 emissions of the freeway project. CO2 emissions distribution of the different types of materials and equipment distribute as the similar Pareto Principle, which reminds that definition of system boundary could focus on the few of inputs that matter on the aspects of data limited, rough estimation and comprehensive understanding of environmental impact.

Moreover, a simple, reproducible, ambient temperature, and low-cost manufacture is followed. Mix design aims to maximize wastes incorporation and optimize the mechanical performance. Preliminary tests indicate that the used wastes may be successfully employed to produce green geopolymeric concretes with satisfying mechanical performance (up to 18 MPa), according to the European standards.

Greenhouse gas emissions of different fly ash based geopolymer concretes in building construction,Greenhouse gas emissions; Fly ash geopolymer; Alkali activated slag; Construction; Building,ENVIRONMENTAL EMISSIONS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; OFFICE BUILDINGS; ENERGY; CORROSION; FOUNDATION; RESISTANCE; REDUCTION; BEHAVIOR; IMPACTS,"Replacing virgin materials with recycled or sustainable materials to reduce energy consumptions and emissions is the focus of contemporary research to reduce building related emissions. Geopolymer concrete produced using 100% fly ash is a similar sustainable construction material capable of replacing Portland Cement (PC) concrete. As a replacement for PC, fly ash seems to be a sustainable solution, however the benefits from the production process of fly ash geopolymer (FAGP) concrete is the subject of considerable debate. In addition, factors such as local availability and transportation issues could potentially increase the emission profile of FAGP concrete. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the emission profiles for different types of fly ash in Australia considering availability and transportation. A case study and a scenario analysis are also presented to demonstrate the factors that affect the Green House Gas (GHG) emission profile of FAGP manufacture. The results indicate that to the GHG emission profile for FAGP concrete changes considerably based on the material availability, transportation and mix design. Alkali activators and elevated heat curing processes also significantly contribute the total GHG emissions of FAGP concrete production. The results further signify that the case study location could influence the employment of FAGP concrete in terms of GHG emissions. Further studies are encouraged on optimising the cost, GHG emissions, availability and strength characteristics to strike a balance between in sustainability for selecting the best FAGP type for construction. The results also provide the initial factors to be considered in developing a guideline for employing sustainable materials in the building industry.

The aim was developing an exhaustive and reliable inventory of high-quality primary data, comparing the environmental impacts along the three stages of the building life cycle. The pre-use phase takes into account the production of all the construction materials, transportation, and on-site assembling. The use phase quantifies the resource consumptions for 50 years of the building utilization and ordinary maintenance. The end-of-life phase includes the building demolition and the management of generated wastes. The results quantify how the design criteria affect the environmental performances of the residential building along its life cycle. The role of the pre-use phase appears remarkable for global warming potential (GWP), due to the huge impacts of steel and concrete production processes. The use phase gives the largest contributions, which reach 77% and 84% of the total, for the categories of global warming and non-renewable energy. The end-of-life phase provides limited avoided impacts. A comparative analysis quantifies the improvements achievable with an alternative type of partitions and external walls.",2018
Quantifying the damage susceptibility to extreme events of mountain stream check dams using Rough Set Analysis,flood damage Indexes; flood defence structures; integrated flood risk management; life-cycle management,VULNERABILITY; INDEX,"In this work, a Rough Set Analysis-based approach is proposed to quantify the damage susceptibility of check dams through specific indexes, which all require expert judgment to be quantified. The indexes are the Post-Event Damage Condition (DamPost), the induced Condition Change (DamCh), the Residual Condition (RC), and the Post-Event Functionality (FPost). Preliminarily, an existing data set, containing a quantification of the damage indexes, the associated characterisation of the flow process type of three torrential hazard events occurred in South Tyrol (Italy), the identification of construction material and the determination of age of the structure, was statistically analysed. To predict the damage indexes based on Rough Set Analysis, a general model, which considered all check dams regardless of their construction material, two specific models, for concrete and for masonry structures respectively, and a simplified version of the general model were set up. The derived rule bases exhibited satisfactory prediction accuracies only when the post-event functionality, FPost, was chosen. Prediction accuracies were 68% for the general model, 79% for the material category concrete, 60% for the material category masonry, and 86% could be obtained by simplifying the decision attribute to a binary form (functionality given or not).",2018
Tobacco waste ash: a promising supplementary cementitious material,Concrete; Tobacco waste ash; Supplementary cementitious material; Sustainable construction material; Compressive strength; Design of experiments,OIL FUEL ASH; FLY-ASH; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; FURNACE SLAG; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; MICROSTRUCTURE; PASTES,"According to the European Cement Association, CEMBUREAU, in 2015, the global cement production was 4.6billion tons. Traditional cement production emits approximately 1 ton of CO2 per ton of cement, which represents almost 80% of the total CO2 emissions of concrete and approximately 6% of the world's emissions. Among supplementary cementitious materials, the use of agro-waste ash emerges due to its reduced CO2 emissions, chloride diffusion, and materials cost, in addition to its greater compressive strength. In Colombia, the disposal of agro-wastes, such as tobacco waste, is an environmental and economic concern. In this study, ash obtained from tobacco waste (TWA) was studied as a sustainable partial replacement for cement in hydraulic concrete. The TWA was reduced to a particle size of less than 75m and was characterized by X-ray florescence. A central composite design was used to study the influence of the ash replacement percentage of cement and the water/binder (w/b) ratio on the compressive strength at 28days. The results show that it is possible to replace 10% of the cement with TWA using a 0.5 w/b ratio and obtain a 51% higher compressive strength than the control mixture at 28days. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrated an improvement of 86% in the 7-day compressive strength when TWA was used.",2018

A possibility is to use supplementary cementitious materials and recycled aggregates. Therefore, the objective of this work is to compare the environmental impacts (EI) of concrete mixes, which contain different incorporation ratios of fly ash (FA) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), with and without Superplasticizer (SP). The Life Cycle Assessment methodology was used for environmental assessment, according to ISO 14040 (2006) and EN 15804 (2012). Contrary to most of the previous studies, this one separately obtained the impact for each life cycle stage in detail (e.g. the impact of raw materials production, transportation, and mixing procedure), and explains the reason behind selecting each dataset. Thus, the results of this study can be used for other case studies. The results show that the EI slightly increased when SP was used. Moreover, the incorporation ratio of fine RCA did not change the results for most of the EI categories. Nevertheless, the EI of most of the categories decreased when coarse NA was fully replaced with coarse RCA. Despite the long transportation distance between the coal power plant and the concrete plant considered in the case study, the El significantly decreased in most categories with increasing amounts of FA.",2018

Geopolymer concrete (GPC) is a relatively new construction material that is yet to be regulated by standards due to the high variability in the mix design. This paper thoroughly investigates the mechanical, chemical, and durability properties of three types of GPC in an attempt to improve mix designs. In Type I, four concrete mixes were synthesized with high binder content (43%) and 3%-6% microsilica. In Type II, four concrete mixes were made with moderate binder content (20%) and 0%-6% calcium carbonate. In Type III, one mix was designed with low binder content (15%). High compressive strength (71.6MPa) was achieved by the M1 mix of Type I. Type II and III mixes showed strengths superior to those of comparable mixes from previous studies. It was found that Type I mixes were more prone to microcracking than mixes with a lower binder content, resulting in poor durability performances. Type II and III mixes performed similarly in the durability tests, which was mainly due to their similar binder contents. It was shown that microsilica and calcium carbonate could be added to GPC mixes without a significant impact on durability performance. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2018

Hence, in this research, the rheological properties of fresh cement paste with different content of graphene (0.03, 0.05 and 0.10% by weight of cement) were investigated. The parameters considered were test geometries (concentric cylinders and parallel plates), shear rate range (300-0.6, 200-0.6 and 100-0.6 s(-1)), resting time (0, 30 and 60 min) and superplasticizer dosage (0 and 0.1% by weight of cement). Four rheological prediction models such as Modified Bingham, Herschel-Bulkley, Bingham model and Casson model were chosen for the estimation of the yield stress, plastic viscosity and trend of the flow curves. The effectiveness of these rheological models in predicting the flow properties of cement paste was verified by considering the standard error method. Test results showed that the yield stress and the plastic viscosity increased with the increase in graphene content and resting time while the yield stress and the plastic viscosity decreased with the increase in the dosage of superplasticizer. At higher shear rate range, the yield stress increased while the plastic viscosities decreased. The Herschel-Bulkley model with the lowest average standard error and standard deviation value was found to best fit the experimental data, whereas, Casson model was found to be the most unfitted model. Graphene reduces the flow diameter and electrical resistivity up to 9.3 and 67.8% and enhances load carrying capacity and strain up to 16.7 and 70.1% of the composite specimen as compared with plain cement specimen. Moreover, it opened a new dimension for graphene-cement composite as smart sensing building construction material.",2018
Assessment of bamboo leaf ash/lime-stabilized lateritic soils as construction materials,Bamboo leaf ash; Lateritic soils; Lime; Compressive strength; Water absorption; California bearing ratio,PERFORMANCE; CEMENT; ASH,"This paper evaluates the suitability of stabilized lateritic soils as highway and building (bricks) construction materials and the influence of locally available, cheap and environmental friendly stabilizer on the mechanical strength. The laboratory study employed four lateritic soil samples stabilized with varying amount of bamboo leaf ash (BLA) ranging from 2-8%. BLA was later kept constant at 5% and further added with lime (LSL) ranging between 2.5-10%. This resulted in four different LATERITE-BLA-LSL mix which are mix-1 (20:1:0.5), mix-2 (20:1:1), mix-3 (20:1:1.5) and mix-4 (20:1:2), respectively. The engineering properties of the specimens were evaluated through unconfined compression strength (UCS), California Bearing Ratio (CBR), compressive strength and water absorption. The UCS for the stabilized soils increased as BLA increased from 2 to 6% and the mix increased from mix-1 to mix-4, with maximum UCS observed between 5-6% BLA and mix-3 (7.5% LSL). The soaked and unsoaked CBR values, which ranged between 10-44 and 27-76%, respectively, satisfied the minimum requirement for most building standards for subgrade and sub-base of 10 and 30%, respectively. Results of BLA + LSL bricks indicated that compressive strength increased, while water absorption decreased with increase in the firing temperature and percentage of stabilization, which met the American Standard for Testing Materials (ASTM) standard specification for concrete building bricks. This study has shown the combined optimum improvement of soils and its suitability as subgrade, sub-base and building bricks construction materials.",2018
Effect of Preliminary Selection of RC Shear Walls' Ductility Level on Material Quantities,conceptual design phase; reinforced concrete; shear walls; ductility; dynamic analysis; material quantities,MOMENT-RESISTING FRAMES; NATIONAL-BUILDING-CODE; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; PROVISIONS; COLUMNS; CANADA; DESIGN; A23.3,"According to the National Building Code of Canada, the seismic force resisting systems (SFRS) of reinforced concrete (RC) buildings are classified based on their ductility level as being ductile, moderately ductile and conventional construction systems. The selection of the ductility level of an SFRS at the conceptual design phase is primarily governed by the seismicity at the building location, the building dynamic characteristics, and the height limitations specified by the design code. The selected ductility level affects the design loads, the cross-sections and reinforcement of the SFRS components, and hence the overall construction cost. This paper aims to evaluate the effect of the wall's selected ductility level on the quantities of its constituent materials as well as the rebar detailing. Four multi-storey RC shear wall buildings with different heights located in three different cities in Canada; Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, were selected to represent three different seismic hazard zones (low, medium, and high). For each building height and location, the walls were designed using the dynamic analysis procedure of the National Building Code of Canada to reach different ductility levels. The construction material quantity estimates were evaluated and compared to a reference case for each building height, seismic hazard and ductility level. The effect of ductility level on the bars detailing is also investigated. This paper helps the structural engineers to select the cost-effective and constructible RC shear wall system at the conceptual design phase before reaching the detailed design phase.",2018

This is the major impediment in the utilization of this green concrete in cast in-situ concrete structures. In order to expand the applications of these binders to various fields of construction, attempts have to be intensified to overcome this obstacle. Incorporation of finer materials with high specific surface area to enhance the reactivity of alkali activated concrete (AAC) is one of the potential approaches to accelerate their strength gain. In this regard, nanomaterials, such as nanosilica (NS), can play a key role. Therefore, to enable curing at room temperature, incorporation of NS as partial replacement of natural pozzolan (NP) in developing MC is the focus of this research work. MC mixes were prepared by partially replacing NP with NS up to 7.5% by weight. The compressive strength development was monitored until 180 days of room temperature curing (23 +/- 2 degrees C). Flexural strength and modulus of elasticity of concrete were also measured. Constitutive models relating the engineering properties of the developed MC were formulated using regression analysis. In addition, SEM and XRD techniques were used to assess the nature of the binder formed during alkali activation. The data developed in the reported study indicated that NP, without incorporating NS, can be used as precursor material for producing MC that could be potentially used as a construction material. However, AAC mixtures incorporating NS exhibited remarkable enhancement in the mechanical properties and microstructural characteristics. The addition of, 5% and 7.5% NS resulted in superior mechanical properties and a denser microstructure due to the greater transformation of precursor material in to polymeric compounds. The tangible outcomes of this research highlights the importance of nanomaterials in improving the properties of green building materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Empirical models to predict rheological properties of fiber reinforced cementitious composites for 3D printing,Rheological properties; 3D cementitious materials printing; Thixotropy; Statistical design,PERFORMANCE; GEOPOLYMER; CONCRETE; DESIGN; THIXOTROPY; EMISSIONS; STRENGTH,"3D printable construction materials need to be conveyed through a delivery system whilst possess certain flow resistance to ensure materials can sustain the weight of subsequent layers. To meet these requirements, material rheological properties should be optimized. In this study, factorial design was adopted to evaluate the influences of five variables (water-to-binder ratio, sand-to-binder ratio, fly ash-to-cement ratio, silica fume-to-cement ratio, and dosage of fiber) on material theological properties (flow resistance, torque viscosity and thixotropy). Empirical models were established to predict theological properties and were verified by experiment. Results imply that the increment of the dosage of fiber boosts all the rheological parameters, which are declined with the increment of water-to-binder ratio. Torque viscosity raises while flow resistance and thixotropy are decreased with the rise of fly ash-to cement ratio. Conversely, the influence of silica fume-to-cement ratio shows an opposite trend on rheological properties as compared to that of fly ash-to-cement ratio. Flow resistance and torque viscosity are improved whilst thixotropy is declined if sand-to-binder ratio increases. Different formulations were adopted in printing test for verification and demonstration purpose via a robotic arm printing system in the end. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018

Application of nanomaterials in different sectors has shown that the properties of conventional materials can be significantly improved when nanoparticles are included. The addition of nanoparticles in cementitious materials can act as a filler agent, producing a dense matrix and reduce the growth of micro pores. Some nanoparticles also help in the secondary reactions forming cement composite and contribute to the strength development. Moreover, this paper summarises the current knowledge of the microstructure, mechanical strength and durability of cementitious materials when incorporating different types of nanoparticles.

In this study, the compressive and splitting tensile strength of concrete with different levels of light crude oil contamination (0, 1, 2, 6, 10 and 20%) were evaluated. Microstructure observation was also conducted to better understand how the oil contamination is affecting the concrete properties. The bond strength of steel reinforcement and a comparative evaluation of the flexural behaviour of steel reinforced beams using concrete with 0% and 6% oil contamination was carried out. Results showed that concrete with light crude oil contamination can retain most of its compressive and splitting tensile strength at a contamination level of up to 6%. A good bond between the steel reinforcement and concrete can be achieved up to this level of oil contamination. The concrete beam with 6% oil contamination exhibited only a 20% reduction in the moment capacity compared to a beam using uncontaminated concrete. Simplified empirical equations were also proposed to reliably predict the mechanical properties of concrete containing oil contaminated sand. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018

The reaction mechanism, engineering properties, and leaching behaviors of alkali-activated BFFS materials were investigated. The results show that the main crystalline phase of the reaction products is stratlingite, and the gel phase is a kind of C-A-S-H with Ca/Si and Al/Si ratios of 0.64-1.65 and 0.57-1.44, respectively. The reaction of BFFS greatly depends on the alkalinity and silicon modulus, with a high alkalinity and low silicon modulus resulting in a rapid initial exothermic rate, a high reaction degree, and a denser pore structure in the alkali-activated BFFS materials. In addition, the compressive strength of the alkali-activated BFFS mortar is comparable to that of the alkali-activated blast furnace slag (BE); furthermore, the alkali-activated BFFS shows more continuous strength gains from 7 days to 90 days and much lower 7-day autogenous shrinkage. More importantly, the alkali-activation treatment can significantly decrease the leaching amount of Mn, Cr(VI) and Cr(III), and it converts the hazardous BFFS to non-toxic construction materials.

Life cycle carbon dioxide emissions for fill dams,Life cycle assessment; Infrastructure; Fill dam; Survival function; Carbon dioxide emissions,CO2 EMISSIONS; CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE; ENERGY; COST,"The construction industry including infrastructure construction, affects the environment due to the use of a considerable amount of resources and energy. The management of the environmental effect of dams for agricultural reservoirs is especially important in South Korea because of their large scale and nationwide distribution. The objective of this study is to propose an assessment method for evaluating life cycle carbon dioxide emissions associated with fill dams and to characterize carbon dioxide emissions to use in effectively addressing the environmental concerns for infrastructures. A total of four dams were selected for the research, and the material production, use of equipment and transportation were considered as the causes of carbon dioxide emissions at the dams. The effective life cycle of a fill dam was assumed to be 100 years. The results of the research indicated that the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions were different for each dam according to their characteristics, and the results showed that the dam size is the primary cause. In addition, the carbon dioxide emissions increased as the period of use increased, and a rapid increase was indicated in 40-50 years interval of the dams' use periods because the repair activities were concentrated in those years. Materials were the biggest contributor in the amount of total carbon dioxide emissions at all four sites and the ratio of carbon dioxide emissions caused by materials was higher than any other factors in most processes. There was little difference in the proportion of carbon dioxide emissions for each process in the total carbon dioxide emissions for the four sites. Most carbon dioxide was emitted during repair activities at the two largest dams. Activities associated with the construction process was the major source of carbon dioxide emissions at the two other dams. This difference in process carbon dioxide emissions was the result of the difference in the construction scale for the embankment elevation. The assessment method that has been proposed in this study reflects the characteristics of fill dams, and the result of estimating carbon dioxide emissions indicates that we are able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the life cycle of fill dams by selecting the construction materials and the repair methods with a low carbon dioxide emissions.

Technological assessment of tailings from quartzite mining sites in Alpinopolis (Minas Gerais-Brazil) as aggregates in concrete block paving (CBP),Geotechnical properties of the rocks; Construction material; Sustainability; Block paving,WASTE,"The quartzite minings of AlpinopolisMinas GeraisBrazil represent an important share of the regional economy; however, the difficulties of the miners in meeting the environmental requirements have led to the closing of the activities in many places, which reflects both a social problem, increasing unemployment, and an environmental problem due to the large environmental liabilities caused by the piles of tailings resulting from the activity. This article discusses the search for alternatives for this problem and trusts in the reuse of these tailings as aggregates for the civil construction as a way to promoting socio-environmental sustainability in the region. The objective of the research was to evaluate the feasibility of using the tailings thrown in the mining tailing piles as fine and coarse aggregate for the production of concrete block paving as an alternative to the use of conventional aggregates. The steps of the research were: choosing and preparing the study materials; technological characterization of aggregates; aggregate dosing study; producing and testing of concrete parts; and economic feasibility study. Parts made with different fine and coarse aggregate dosages of quartzite tailing presented satisfactory results for different applications; however, the parts which were replaced only with the coarse aggregate were those that achieved the best resistance values. In the economic feasibility study, it was estimated that a cost reduction of around 23% would result from the implementation of paving when only the conventional coarse aggregate is replaced by the tailing quartzite and a 37% reduction when both the coarse and the fine aggregate were replaced.",2018

The proposed strategy is elaborated with a case study in Nagpur, India. A single storey, four-room model was planned as per the National Building Code of India. The performance of the model building was evaluated by using energy simulation software TRNSYS. The cellular light-weight bricks used in the construction were made with bio briquette ash (BBA), which is a locally available waste material. Instead of using the conventional reinforced cement concrete (RCC) roof, aluminium and sawdust were suggested as a reflecting-cum-insulating material. To improve the temperature control in model homes, installation of a reflecting-cum-insulating material was conducted, consisting of aluminium and sawdust, over the conventional RCC roof. The model building constructed with these new materials was compared with that built with conventional fly ash bricks and RCC roof. Results show that the proposed model building improved the efficiency of indoor temperature control by 23% and, at the same time, reduced the cost by 13%. The present concept will contribute to the redevelopment of slum dwellings to deliver cost-effective dwelling units that provide occupants with acceptable thermal comfort.",2018
Life cycle assessment to evaluate the environmental performance of new construction material from stainless steel slag,Alkali activation; Carbonation; Hazardous waste management; Industrial symbiosis; Life cycle assessment; Stainless steel slag; Sustainable building materials,BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; ACCELERATED CARBONATION; MINERAL CARBONATION; NATURAL-RESOURCES; CEMENT INDUSTRY; CO2 PERFORMANCE; ASSESSMENT LCA; CONCRETE; IMPACT; EMISSIONS,"PurposeMany new opportunities are explored to lower the CO2 emissions of the cement industry. Academic and industrial researches are currently focused on the possibility of recycling steel production residues in the cement industry, in order to produce new low-carbon binders for construction materials. The purpose of this paper is to assess the environmental benefits and costs of steel residue valorisation processes to produce a new binder for construction materials.MethodsAmong other stainless steel slags (SSS), argon oxygen decarburisation (AOD)-slag has the potential to be recovered as a binder during the production of new construction materials. Alkali activation and carbonation processes can, in fact, activate the binding properties of the AOD-slag. However, AOD-slag is today only recycled as low-quality aggregate. For the present study, three different types of construction blocks (called SSS-blocks) were developed starting from the AOD-slag (one block through alkali activation and two blocks through carbonation). The data from the production of the three construction blocks have been collected and used to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) study, comparing SSS-block production with the production of traditional paver ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete.Results and discussionThe analysis showed that SSS-block production through alkali activation and carbonation has the potential of lowering some of the environmental impacts of OPC-concrete. The LCA results also show that the main bottleneck in the alkali activation process is the production of the alkali activators required in the process, while the use of electricity and of pure CO2 streams in carbonation lowers the environmental performances of the entire process.ConclusionsThe valorisation of AOD-slag to produce new construction materials is a promising route to lower the environmental impacts of cement and concrete industries. This product-level analysis stresses the need of updating the LCI datasets for alkali activators and boric oxide and of widening the scope of the environmental analysis up to system level, including potential economic interactions and market exchanges between steel and construction sectors.",2018
Assessment of reinforcement corrosion protection of self-curing concrete,Self-curing concrete; Water-soluble polymers; Electrical resistivity; Chloride ion penetrability; Microstructure; Reinforcement Corrosion,HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE; WATER-RETENTION; CURE CONCRETE; DURABILITY; RESISTANCE; PLAIN,"The curing of concrete requires high water demand. In this study reinforcement corrosion protection of selfcuring concrete (SC) mixtures incorporating two water-soluble polymers; polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyacrylamide (PAM) have been evaluated. Durability indices; electrical resistivity, chloride ion penetrability and water permeability, were evaluated and compared to that of control concrete mixture with no self-curing agents under different curing regimes. Reinforcement corrosion monitoring was conducted by exposing reinforced concrete prisms at the age of 28 days to wet-dry cycles for a total period of 96 weeks. In the wetting cycle, the prisms were partially immersed in 5% sodium chloride solution at ambient temperature. The corrosion activity was evaluated by measuring the corrosion potential and corrosion current density. Self-curing concrete mixtures showed better reinforcement protection and durability indices than those of air-cured control mixture. Short water curing period of 3 days significantly improved the reinforcement protection and durability indices of the self-curing concrete mixtures to a level comparable to that of the control mixture that was moist-cured for 28 days. Self-curing concrete represents a step towards a new construction material due to its lower demand for curing water and hence can reserve the limited water resources in many parts of the world.",2018

Five types of hybrid timber structure have been chosen in this study toward finding the most optimum choice for Malaysian low income housing. The base material of all case studies are wood and only main frame of structures are different. The environmental impact of each individual design encompasses material extraction, transportation, construction, maintenance and end-of-life phases. The life cycle aspect of current research is evaluated for global warming potential (GWP), human-toxicity potential (HTP), eutrophication (EP), fossil depletion (FDP), acidification (AP), life cycle cost (LCC) and social life cycle assessment (SLCA). The result revealed the different emissions between various structural schemes in all stages. Decision making process was oriented to sustainability as the hybrid steel stud & timber (T2) generally performed better than timber structure with concrete, LVL or GLT with steel. Particularly, T2 had the lowest GWP (3.31E+3 kg-CO2-eq) and LCC (212,750 MYR) which was the lowest in comparison with other hybrid timber structures. Also the result of job creation revealed that timber sector will provide higher wage not only for existing employees but for timber sector regarding creating higher job possibility. The sensitivity analysis was accomplished on electricity usage and assumed instead of full fossil fuel mix electricity applied for acquiring construction material on mill. The result shows almost 15-30% less GWP emission for all building structure.",2018
Investigating a reinforced lightweight foamed concrete walling system for low-rise residential buildings in moderate seismic regions,,,"Historically, lightweight foam concrete (LWFC) has been used in non-structural applications. However, low self-weight, insulating properties and fire resistance make LWFC an ideal construction material for residential infrastructure, if suitable mechanical properties of strength, stiffness and ductility, as well as durability can be assured. The development of LWFC for structural use has created a need for a structural system that harnesses these beneficial material properties. In this paper a LWFC walling system is proposed, tested and analysed with finite elements. Results of quasi-static monotonic pull-over tests as well as cyclic tests indicate that the proposed precast walling and connection system is likely to both provide predictable structural behaviour as well as adequate resistance for low-rise residential buildings in regions of low to moderate seismicity.",2018
Comparative environmental life cycle assessment of fiber reinforced cement panel between kenaf and glass fibers,Life cycle assessment; Environmental impact assessment; Kenaf fiber reinforced cement composite; Wall panel; Structural function; Thermal insulation function,COMPOSITES; ENERGY; PERFORMANCE; CONCRETE,"A large quantity of resources consumed by the construction industry and the resultant pollution has inspired the need to study eco-friendly materials, such as kenaf fibers, that can be used for construction applications. Kenaf fibers were used to reinforce cement by fabricating fiber reinforced cement composites that exhibited outstanding mechanical and thermo-physical properties. A considerable interest has arisen in investigating the use of natural fiber to replace synthetic fiber for different composite products to alleviate the environmental impact from the traditional construction materials. In order to evaluate the environmental performances of glass fiber reinforced cement wall panels and kenaf fiber reinforced cement wall panels, this study conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) on the fiber reinforced cement wall panels between kenaf fiber and traditional glass fiber. The structural function and thermal insulation function of the wall panels were considered as two separate functional units. The LCA results showed that the environmental impact could be significantly reduced using kenaf fiber to replace glass fiber as reinforcement in the cement wall panels in regards to both structural and insulation functions. The major contribution to the environmental impact for the fiber reinforced wall panels was from cement and the production of the cement raw materials. Kenaf fiber significantly reduced environmental impact, which can be a viable eco-friendly material to replace glass fiber for the construction industry. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential of raw sewage sludge in construction industry - A review,Sewage sludge; Construction industry; Eco-building materils; Sewage sludge stabilization; Mortar; Concrete,WASTE-WATER TREATMENT; LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE; LAND APPLICATION; HEAVY-METALS; FLY-ASH; RISK-ASSESSMENT; MANAGEMENT; BRICKS; ENERGY; PYROLYSIS,"Excess sewage sludge produced in any municipal or industrial wastewater treatment plant becomes a serious problem due to its increasing amount. This increase is related to the improvement of treatment technologies, expansion of sewage systems and the development of new industrial plants. The implementation and development of new technologies related to the utilization of sewage sludge is currently based on treating it as a substrate. Construction is an industry branch where sewage sludge, as well as other waste materials, can be used. The use of sewage sludge in building materials eliminates some of the expensive and energy-intensive stages of utilization, and the final product obtained is often stable and safe. This is confirmed, among other research regarding strength properties, water resistance, frost resistance and heavy metal leaching, especially when the amount of sewage sludge in solidified samples is low. The main purpose of the article is to present the latest methods of using sewage sludge (dried, dehydrated, and raw) in building and construction materials. Methods of producing low-strength materials for landfilling purposes have also been described. The stabilization of sewage sludge with binding additives improves the end product's durability compared to standard solutions (dewatering). The use of sludge in concrete and mortars mixes is usually associated with a reduction in their strength compared to mixtures without sludge. The binder in the mixture is responsible for the strength of concrete or mortar. Sintering sewage sludge to make ceramic products (bricks, tiles) and lightweight aggregates is a promising approach, but in comparison to other methods such solutions require more energy expenditure. Nevertheless, the obtained products are stable and their durability, while lower than that of the control samples, still qualifies them for applications in construction. Due to the different physicochemical properties of sludge, the methods of its management should be designed separately. It is therefore difficult to select one general and the most optimal method of management of sludge in building materials, but on the basis of the presented review, the authors indicate that one of the best methods of management is sintering sewage sludge into lightweight aggregates.

Investigations on the influence of matrix and textile on the response of textile reinforced concrete slabs under impact loading,Textile reinforced concrete; impact; slabs; glass textile; basalt textile,CEMENTITIOUS COMPOSITES; PERFORMANCE; GEOMETRY; FABRICS; POLYMER,"Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC) is gaining its popularity as a construction material. It is essential to investigate new materials to quantify its expected structural performance and integrity. The purposed study is to investigate the influence of material type and volume fraction of textile and type of matrix on the impact behaviour of textile reinforced concrete slabs. Both glass and basalt textiles were used in the investigations. Based on the investigations, it is concluded that the type of binder influences the impact resistance at first crack as well as the delamination possibility. Glass textile reinforced concrete slabs show more displacement and more residual capacity compared to basalt textile reinforced concrete slabs. With increased number of layers, the basalt textile reinforced concrete slabs exhibited decrease in impact resistance due to delamination. As energy level increases, glass textile reinforced slabs show increase in peak displacement whereas basalt textile reinforced concrete slabs show a decrease. The investigations reported will be useful for extending the knowledge of textile reinforced concrete for various impact resistant applications.",2018

Compressive strength and electrical resistivity tests were used to evaluate the mortars' performance. A multi-regression (MR) model was also utilised to study the effects of curing time and content of OPC, GGBS and HCFA on the mortars' strength and to identify the relationship between measured and predicted compressive strengths. The results indicated that the newly developed binder was composed of 35 wt% OPC, 35 wt% GGBS and 30 wt% HCFA that showed a compressive strength and surface electrical resistivity of 30.8 MPa and 103.5 k Omega.cm after 56 days of curing, respectively. Significant changes in the microstructure of the developed binder paste over curing time were evidenced by SEM imaging. The statistical analysis indicated that the influence of the parameters examined on the development of the mortars' compressive strength could be modelled with a coefficient of determination, R-2 of 0.893, and that the relative importance of these parameters followed the order curing time (t) > HCFA% > OPC% > GGBS%. This new binder could contribute significantly to decreasing the cost of construction materials and to reducing CO2 emissions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
New eco-cellular concretes: sustainable and energy-efficient materials,,ALKALI-ACTIVATED BINDERS; CATALYST RESIDUE FCC; CANE STRAW ASH; FOAM CONCRETE; WASTE GLASS; FLY-ASH; GEOPOLYMER; MORTAR; CONSTRUCTION; STRENGTH,"Chemistry is an essential science for understanding and developing construction materials. Specifically, the application of the green chemistry concept to the cement sector may allow the fabrication of new environmentally friendly materials with good sustainability and energy efficiency. Cellular concretes are an excellent alternative to conventional concrete in terms of thermal insulation and material economy. In this paper, the development of waste-based cellular concrete is presented; due to its good performance and low environmental impact, this focus is warranted. Three different cellular concrete systems were investigated: (i) traditional cellular concrete based on ordinary Portland cement and commercial aluminium powder; (ii) geopolymer cellular concrete applying alkali-activated chemical technology with a comparison of the use of two precursors, fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue (FCC) and blast furnace slag (BFS), and recycled aluminium foil as an aerating agent; (iii) eco-cellular concrete, where commercial waterglass was replaced by an agro-industrial by-product, rice husk ash (RHA), in the activating solution. The development of geopolymer cellular concretes with different precursors and activating solutions has proven that the production of this type of concrete using different types of precursors is possible, depending on the availability of by-products and wastes. The densities, compressive strengths, and thermal properties of the three cellular concrete systems are assessed and a complete study on the carbon footprints of the developed concretes is presented. The results show that the alternative concretes have densities from 474 to 813 kg m(-3), with compressive strengths from 2.6 to 4.6 MPa and thermal conductivities from 0.083 to 0.281 W m(-1) K-1. In the case of the cellular concrete prepared using RHA in the activating reagent, the heat released from the dissolution of NaOH pellets in water dissolved the soluble silica present in the ash. This production method resulted in a reduction of its carbon footprint by 78%.",2018
"Effect of microwave heating damage on the electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of fibre-reinforced cement mortars",Cement-based mortars; Microwave heating; Thermal conductivity; Electrical resistivity; Mechanical damage; Fibre influence,PLANE SOURCE TECHNIQUE; HIGH EARLY STRENGTH; CONCRETE; CONDUCTIVITY; DIFFUSIVITY; PASTES; ENERGY,"Nowadays, refurbishing of existing structures has gained interest in order to reduce both the construction materials used and the construction and demolition waste production. For that purpose, there are several methods for demolishing the damaged parts, but most of the alternatives involve high noise and dust production, which are in contraposition when structures are in urban areas. Among all the existing methods, this paper studies the possibility of using microwave heating as a demolition method, either by damaging the bulk material or the mortar to concrete interface. With that in mind, the effect of microwave heating time (range 120-600 s) on the physical, thermal, electrical, mechanical and bonding properties of steel fibre-reinforced and non-reinforced cement mortars was analysed. The aim of the paper is to establish possible correlations between the mentioned properties and the damage level caused by microwave heating. Although the results prove that pore pressure increment due to microwave heating can cause the reduction of flexural strength up to the rupture of the specimens, this fact cannot be extended to all the properties or mortar types. The fibre reinforcement plays a key role to restrain the damage. Thermal conductivity and electrical resistivity are obviously different in reinforced and non-reinforced mortars due to the inclusions of the metallic fibres. However, after undergoing microwave heating those properties were not noticeably altered nor follow a trend linked to the heating time. It is assumed that the water migration and evaporation processes are the main cause. Although the flexural strength reduction was gradual for non-reinforced mortars until total failure, the reinforced specimens only showed a 13% of reduction for the first 120 s, remaining almost constant afterwards. Although it was proved that the fibres increase the temperature on the specimen surface and its adhesion to the matrix is altered, their crack bridging effect overcomes further damage.

Alkali-activation of fly ash and cement kiln dust mixtures for stabilization of demolition aggregates,Cement; Kiln dust; Fly ash; Demolition; Stabilization; Construction,INDUSTRIAL BY-PRODUCTS; BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; CURING TEMPERATURE; HYDRATION PRODUCTS; CONCRETE; BINDERS; BLENDS; CKD,"Utilization of industrial by-products such as cement kiln dust (CKD) and fly ash (FA) for increasing the strength and stiffness of demolition waste aggregates can be an optimal and sustainable solution for reducing the carbon footprint of the construction activities. Furthermore, this approach of incorporating waste materials as construction materials will also reduce the rapid depletion rate of natural resources. This research presents an optimization, by means of evaluating combinations of CKD + FA blends to utilize the rich source of calcium and silica and alumina in these by-products. The impact of sample preparation method is investigated. The use of alkaline solutions facilitates the progression of activation process in room temperature. Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA), Crushed Brick (CB) and Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) are three major components of the demolition waste stream and were used as the parent materials in this research for assessment of the efficiency of stabilization process. The durability of the stabilized materials under repeated loading was investigated. In addition, the resilient modulus of the stabilized materials were compared with the empirical models to assess the impact of confining stress and deviatoric stress on the moduli of the mixtures. The optimum ratio of FA:CKD of 50:50 showed the highest performance. The research indicates that alkali-activation of 15%CKD and 15%FA blended with C&D aggregates provided the optimum blend for the usage of these wastes as construction materials.

Against this background, geopolymer concrete has started to gain significant attention from the research scholars and construction practitioners, due to its advantageous in using by-product waste to replace cement and reducing greenhouse gas emission during its production. It also possesses better mechanical properties and durability compared to conventional concrete. Despite its advantageous, the use of geopolymer concrete in practical is considerably limited. This is mainly due to the lacking in the studies in terms of structural elements, design and application studies. This paper reviewed the material and structural performances of geopolymer concrete to identify the research gaps in this area for future research development. Analysis shown that geopolymer concrete can replace conventional concrete as they presented better mechanical properties, higher durability and more desirable structural performances compared with conventional counterparts. More studies are still needed for practical design standards and finally, the full scale studies on the structural elements should be established to ensure its feasibility in practical.

The technology of geopolymerization that utilizes materials and activator solution to form geopolymer matrix could lead to alleviate some of the issues related to OPC based concrete. Numerous experiments have established that geopolymer concrete has higher compressive strength, higher acid resistivity and lower shrinkage than ordinary concrete. This review article focusses on the microstructure analyses of the geopolymer specimens and comparison of geopolymers with various binders. The review analysis of various binders used and their microstructural investigations reveal that different molarity of sodium hydroxide or phosphoric acid solution, liquid-to-binder ratio, curing temperature and duration yield geopolymers of diverse properties. Most of the geopolymer products revealed a wide hump in the XRD analysis due to the amorphous structure of aluminosilicate. Investigation of MIP and Micro CT reveals that aged geopolymer has a denser matrix arrangement and produce high compressive strength. Geopolymerization prevents interconnectivity of micropores due to the formation of denser matrix of geopolymer gel. Generally, the use of 12M of sodium hydroxide solution, low liquid-to-binder ratio of about 0.4 and curing temperature at approximately 70 degrees C for at least 24 h produced high strength geopolymers. The binders mixed with lower sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide mass ratio of 2.0-2.5 tend to react more efficiently. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Effect of fiber type on the behavior of cementitious composite beam-column joints under reversed cyclic loading,Cement-based composites; Different types of fiber; Beam-column joint; Reversed cyclic loading,STRAIN-HARDENING BEHAVIOR; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; STEEL FIBERS; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; PVA-ECC,"This paper investigates the effect of using different types of fiber on the behavior of engineered cementitious composite (ECC) beam-column joints under reversed cyclic loading. The tested ECC beam-column joints were cast with different types of fiber, including 8 mm and 12 mm polyvinyl alcohol fibers (PVA8 and PVA12), 13 mm polypropylene fibers (PP13), and 13 mm steel fibers (SF13). The investigation also tested a conventional normal concrete (NC) beam-column joint made with 10 mm coarse aggregate for comparison. The performance of the tested specimens was evaluated based on hysteresis behavior, ductility, energy dissipation capacity, and cracking behavior. The results indicated that compared to NC, ECC with either PVA or PP fibers can be a promising construction material to develop beam-column joints with improved ductile behavior under reversed cyclic loading. Using shorter PVA fibers (PVA8 vs. PVA12) appeared to have a stronger influence on improving the cyclic behavior of ECC joints. The highest improvements in terms of first crack load, ultimate load, ductility, and energy dissipation capacity were observed when SF13 was used. The results also indicated that the failure pattern of all ECC joints showed better cracking behavior and higher shear strength compared to the NC joint. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Conventional off-site marine disposal of contaminated sediment incurs substantial cost implications and secondary pollution risks. This study developed value-added and time-effective approaches that transform contaminated sediment into construction materials to be used as fill materials, partition blocks, and paving blocks. The technical viability and economic feasibility of different binder/mixture designs and production methods were assessed. Thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that contaminated sediment hindered hydrates formation and adversely influenced the properties of sediment-based products. Samples with 5 wt% binder could only fulfil strength requirements of fill materials. Tailored mixture designs with dry-mix/press method improved the precipitation reactions and densified the porous structure, which enhanced the performance and conformed to the requirements of partition blocks and even paving blocks. The leaching concentrations of potentially toxic elements and organic contaminants from the dredged sediment were substantially reduced by stabilization/solidification, which satisfied the leach-ability acceptance criteria for its on-site reuse. Moreover, cost and benefit assessment illustrated that the production of all three studied sediment-based products was potentially profitable, of which the scenario recycling sediment into paving blocks showed the highest profit. This novel solution can effectively mitigate burden of dredged sediment disposal and produce green construction materials in a sustainable way. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Nighttime Light Images Reveal Spatial-Temporal Dynamics of Global Anthropogenic Resources Accumulation above Ground,,IN-USE STOCKS; USE STEEL STOCK; CHINA; BUILDINGS; ALUMINUM; IRON; CONSUMPTION; ECONOMY; WORLD,"Urbanization and industrialization represent largely a process of transforming materials from biosphere and lithosphere to anthroposphere. Understanding the patterns of such anthropogenic material stock accumulation is thus a fundamental prerequisite to assess and sustain how humans alter the biophysical movements of resources around Earth. Previous studies on these anthropogenic stocks, however, are often limited to the global and national scales, due to data gaps at higher spatial resolutions. Here, based on a new set of national materials stock data and nighttime light images, we developed a regression model to map the global anthropogenic stocks of three fundamental construction materials (steel, concrete, and aluminum) at a 1 x 1 km level from 1992 to 2008. We revealed an unevenly distributed pattern, with over 40% found in three belts: from England across the Channel to Western Europe; from eastern coast China to South Korea and Japan; and from Great Lakes along eastern coast of United States to Florida. The spatial-temporal dynamics of global anthropogenic stocks at smaller spatial scales reflect a combined effect of physical geography, architectural and construction specifications, and socioeconomic development. Our results provide useful data that can potentially support policy-makers and industry on resource efficiency, waste management, urban mining, spatial planning, and environmental sustainability at regional and urban scales.",2018

In this work, silica was regarded as the stabilization addition to make the f-CaO in molten BOF slag stabilized at high temperature. The influences of experimental conditions on the f-CaO stabilization were studied. The results show that the main influential factors on elimination rate of f-CaO are the ratio CaO/SiO2, reaction temperature and stabilization time. In this work setting conditions, with the ratio CaO/SiO2 less than 2.7, the reaction temperature under 1525 degrees C and the stabilization time over 10 min, the f-CaO content in the stabilized slag falls to the level of less than 3.00%, which can fully meet the Chinese national standard of steel slag powder used for cement and concrete. Additionally, the XRD results indicate that f-CaO is stabilized by silica in forming akermanite phase at high temperature. Moreover, the observation obtained from FESEM indicates that the undissolved lime and precipitated CaO changed into clustered CaO in the stabilized slag with its size ranging from 0.6 mu m to 2.5 mu m.",2018

The production of OPC, the current standard in concrete, relies on a high amount of energy, and as a result accounts for 7% of CO2 emissions worldwide. Production of OPC is expected to increase 4-fold over the next 30 years, posing significant environmental risk. While numerous studies have examined the use of geopolymer concrete as a more sustainable construction material, concerns about the cost and environmental impact are obstacles against widespread production and market adoption. The new mix designs proposed herein result in up to a 50% decrease in the cost of geopolymer concrete, making this sustainable alternative a viable option relative to traditional concrete. In addition, the production of the proposed mixtures requires less than 50% of the fuel usage (thermal energy) required for OPC, decreasing CO2 emissions. The proposed mixtures not only reduce environmental impact, but they also offer improved performance, which may appeal to many concrete manufacturers. While the proposed alternative to Portland cement is suitable for most applications, it is posited that those firms interested in pursuing sustainable construction may be most inclined to adopt the proposed mixture in order to meet their sustainability goals.

Study of aggregate dormancy and its effects on the properties of aggregates and concrete,aggregate; aggregate dormancy; building; concrete; compressive strength,STRENGTH,"In our society today most of the aggregates that were used for concrete work were usually abandoned on site for some times with minimum of 6 month or more due to different factors as it may apply. Some which might be due to lack of fund by the client and tussles. This abandonment led to a situation where construction materials are piled onsite over a range of periods of time. These materials are left dormant and exposed to harsh weathering conditions before utilization. This study accessed the effects of aggregates dormancy on its properties quality when use. The study was carried out in three calendar years (2015, 2016 and 2017) to check weathering activities on dormant aggregates. Experimental procedures such as Sieve analysis, silt content, specific gravity, water absorption and compressive strength test were carried out on these aggregates to determine its quality of performance on the product (building). Based on the duration of aggregate on site, it was observed that the strength of concrete produced from the aggregates increased and the aggregates were coarser when exposed to the weather. The study concluded that due to slight changes in compressive strength over the years, dormant aggregate has no negative effect on concrete strength and quality of structural components but it is advised that any procured aggregates meant for construction should be totally free from clay and silt contents. This will enhance the concrete strength and also accelerate its setting time.",2018

Blending ratio of recycled aggregate on the performance of pervious concrete,Recycled aggregate; Pervious concrete; Permeability; Strength,,"Recycled pervious concrete as an environment-friendly and material-saving construction material can satisfy the current development demands of circular economy and environmental protection in China. But studies concerning the performance of recycled pervious concrete are not enough, which limits its application and promotion. In this study, waste prefabricated concrete beams were taken as the source of recycled aggregate and processed by crushing and screening to obtain recycled coarse aggregate. Then pervious concrete was prepared using the recycled coarse aggregate. Taking replacement rate and grain size grade as the running parameters, five groups of mix proportion were designed. Moreover the physical, mechanical and permeability performance and the interrelation were analyzed by tests. The results demonstrated that the 24-hour water absorption rate of the recycled coarse aggregate was 12 times higher than that of natural aggregate, the porosity of the pervious concrete was between 14.2% and 20.44%, and the permeability coefficient was between 0.19 cm and 0.46 cm and increased with the increase of the porosity. The compressive strength of the pervious concrete increased with the increase of the replacement rate. When the replacement rate was 30%, the improvement amplitude was the largest. The compressive strength was improved 35.4% after double grain grade aggregate was mixed, but the permeability performance decreased.",2018

"Transportation matters - Does it? GIS-based comparative environmental assessment of concrete mixes with cement, fly ash, natural and recycled aggregates",Construction and demolition waste; LCA and GIS combination; Portugal; Recycled aggregates concrete; Transportation impact,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; DEMOLITION WASTE; ECONOMIC-IMPACT; CONSTRUCTION; PORTUGAL; GENERATION; BENEFITS; CRADLE; CHINA; GAS,"The urban world is expanding and densifying fast. This requires and produces huge amounts of new construction materials and construction and demolition waste (CDW) every year. Concrete is not only the most important construction material in terms of sheer amount but also regarding embodied greenhouse gas emissions. Alternative concrete mixes have been developed by introducing supplementary cementitious materials (e.g. fly ash (FA)) and CDW (e.g. recycled aggregates (RA)). So far, environmental assessments focus mostly on the production of concrete mixes without considering the transportation-related impacts. This paper appraises the importance of transportation-related impacts of raw materials for concrete production and proposes a new method combining Life Cycle Assessment and geospatial analysis of road transportation of materials. Environmental impacts (EI) of different mixes are assessed for the specific locations of concrete plants. Traditional and alternative concrete mixes are compared to choose site-specifically the mix with lower impacts. For that purpose, two Portuguese cities were considered as case studies. The new method uncovers if and how location of supply and demand for concrete production is important. The results show that for traditional concrete and for mixes incorporating low FA ratio and/or RA, transportation does not matter. However, it matters when choosing between already drastically improved mixes: then, distances from raw materials suppliers to concrete plants can tip the scales of total EI In fact, the distances to FA and recycling plants influence the selection of the most environmental friendly concrete mix. The method can be applied to other case studies and materials.",2018

The conversion of those wastes into value-added products is highly desirable. Here, Green Calcium Hydroxide Nano-plates (GCHNPs) were first synthesized from waste oyster shells by a chemical precipitation method in an aqueous medium at 90 degrees C without using any additives. The crystal structure with a hexagonal portlandite (Ca(OH)(2)) was observed by both X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The crystal size of around 350-450 nm and specific surface area with 4.96 m(2)g(-1) were confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), respectively.

Early-Age Cracking of Self-Consolidating Concrete with Lightweight and Normal Aggregates,Lightweight self-consolidating concrete; Monte Carlo simulations; Cracking; Shrinkage,RESTRAINED CONCRETE; WORKABILITY,"Lightweight self-consolidating concrete (LSCC) is an attractive construction material combining the benefits of self-consolidating and lightweight concrete. The material is especially beneficial for structures in which reduced load and ease of construction among dense reinforcement are needed. While a great potential for lightweight self-consolidating concrete exists, the material's shrinkage and cracking susceptibility has not been characterized in detail up to date. As such, in this work, laboratory evaluation of LSCC using restrained ring test was conducted. The results showed that the combination of natural and lightweight aggregates resulted in the mixture least susceptible to restrained shrinkage cracking (cracking noted at 6.6days), compared with all-natural (cracking at 3.0days) or lightweight aggregates (cracking at 4.6days). Additionally, the Monte Carlo method was used to develop a model capable of predicting likelihood of cracking in LSCC. The results of the simulations showed good agreement with the restrained ring test results.",2018
Evaluation of durability of concrete substituted heavyweight waste glass as fine aggregate,Heavyweight waste glass; Durability; Water absorption; Freezing and thawing resistance; Sulfate attack; Chloride ion penetration,RADIATION SHIELDING PROPERTIES; CRT FUNNEL GLASS; RECYCLED GLASS; LCD GLASS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PAVING BLOCKS; CRUSHED GLASS; MINE WASTE; MORTAR; SAND,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material, and huge amounts of natural resources are required to manufacture it. With relatively recent rapid industrial development as well as the improvement of people's living standards, the volume of domestic and industrial waste is increasing, and much of this waste is not recycled. Cathode ray tube (CRT) waste glass is an industrial waste material that has been studied by many researchers for use as fine concrete aggregate. As one example of its potential application, nuclear power plants and radioactive waste disposal sites are often located in areas vulnerable to attack by chloride and sulfate, and this may compromise the durability of the concrete structure designed to shield radiation. More durable concrete would therefore be desirable. We studied the durability of concrete mixed with waste glass through the following approach. Waste CRT glass containing heavy metals was recycled as fine aggregate for concrete; the durability of the concrete was investigated by performing freeze-thaw resistance, sulfate attack, and chloride ion penetration measurement. The test results showed that as the mixing ratio of waste glass increased, the freezing and thawing resistance, sulfate attack resistance, and chloride ion penetration resistance were all better in the concrete containing waste glass than in normal concrete. However, the compressive and the flexural strength of the concrete both decreased due to lower adhesion between cement paste and waste glass. In conclusion, it was confirmed that concrete substituted with heavyweight waste glass could be used in radiation shielding structures. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2018

Using this natural fiber as raw material would contribute to the valorization of natural sustainable resources. This paper presents an experimental investigation of a new eco-material based on date palm fiber and lime. The experiments on the elaborated material investigate some mechanical, thermal, acoustic properties and moisture buffering capacity. The influence of the fiber/lime ratio on the behavior of the light-weight aggregate was studied systematically. The results of compressive strength testing indicated that PDF incorporation led to a reduction in resistance limit, however, the recorded average values are still acceptable. Also, it was observed that the thermal conductivity is sensitive to the variation of the fiber/lime composition ratio. The measured thermal conductivity reached a minimum of 0.091 W/m.K for samples of 50% fiber, which indicates that it can be used as a good thermal insulator. With regard to the sound absorption, the new material reveals good absorption capacity based on the measured sound absorption coefficient which is for 50% of fiber: for medium and high frequencies 0.65 and 0.55 respectively. Due to its porous morphology, the proposed material has the ability to absorb water vapor in a high relative humidity environment and to restore it in a dry one. Hence, it could therefore act as a hygric regulator. Measurements of moisture buffer value revealed that the material is classified as good or excellent depending on the percentage of fiber.

Effects of combined environmental exposures and axial load on CFFT,Concrete-filled fiber reinforced polymer tube (CFFT); Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP); Freeze-thaw; Wet-dry; High temperature; Sustained axial load,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; DURABILITY PERFORMANCE; MOISTURE ABSORPTION; REINFORCING BARS; COMPOSITE; BEHAVIOR; EPOXY; INFRASTRUCTURE; INTERFACES; COLUMNS,"Concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube (CFFT) columns have demonstrated superior advantages on mechanical behavior and ease of construction during the past few decades. The fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) tube not only improves the mechanical properties of the concrete core by confinement, but also provides a protection layer for the concrete against the outer corrosive environment. However, one obstacle hindering the greater acceptance of the FRP composite as a conventional construction material in civil engineering applications is the susceptibility of FRP to complex, severe environmental exposure. The purpose of this study is to investigate the durability of CFFT cylinders with glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes under exposure to combined freeze/thaw, heating/cooling, and wet/dry cycles. The effects of combined sustained load and environmental conditions were also investigated during this study. Compression and hoop tensile tests were carried out on both conditioned and controlled specimens. In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and differential-scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests were used to characterize the aging effect on physical and thermal properties of FRP material. Test results showed that more pronounced degradation occurred on the ultimate strain than on the ultimate strength. The sustained load had a negative effect on CFFT cylinders by creating more microcracks in the GFRP tube. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018

The workability and interlayer force of 3 Dimensional printing geopolymer pastes related to its rheological property and more particularly to its structure rebuilding and yield stress. The present study is aimed at investigating structure rebuilding and yield stress of 3 Dimensional printing geopolymer pastes at different Si/Na ratio of alkali activator by rheology method. Results revealed that rheology is an important research method for the extrudability and buildability of 3D printing geopolymer pastes. Structure rebuilding ability (SRE) and fast-growing yield stress of 3 Dimensional printing geopolymer ensured the stability of structure in the period from extrude to hardened of paste. Si/Na ratio of alkali activator has significantly influences on extrudability and buildability of 3D printing geopolymer pastes. High Si/Na ratio of alkali activator decreases the viscosity, yield stress and development rate of fresh pastes. Si/Na ratio of alkali activation significantly influences rate of structure rebuilding of pastes, and low Si/Na ratio of alkali activator exhibited high ability of recovery of pastes.

The potential for the beneficial use of this material for a partial replacement for portland cement was investigated at four levels of replacement (5, 20, 35, and 50%). The heat of hydration was measured for the reference and slag samples by isothermal conduction calorimetry. Results from the study demonstrate that at low replacement percentages the total heat evolution and the compressive strength of the control cement and slag-cement blends are similar. The compressive strength of mortars amended with pulverized and finely milled HTAG slag was measured at 7, 28 and 56 days and the results demonstrate that low replacement percentages (5%) of portland cement with HTAG slag produces comparable strength. Significant decreases in strength and heat were seen when higher replacement percentages (20-50%) were used, however these decreases were partially offset using finer slag. Although the activity index of the slag was relatively low compared to portland cement, an increased activity index can be reached by decreasing the average particle size, suggesting that properly processed HTAG slag does offer potential as a supplementary cementitious material.

Despite its convenience as construction material, the social demands and policies trends are requesting a lower impact and more sustainable cement manufacturing industry. The most effective ways to reach this goal are the substitution of clinker by different wastes or by-products in the cement composition or the development of more sustainable binders like the alkali activated binders. This work analyzes from a technical and environmental point of view the substitution of a clinker based CEM I common cement for the construction mortars manufacturing. Four common cements with different ground granulated blastfurnace slags (GGBS) or fly ashes (FA) contents as well as fifteen alkali activated binders (AAB) combinations were considered. Fresh consistency, density, compressive strength (CS) tests and life cycle analysis were carried out to state the ability of these different hydraulic and alkaline activated binders for the CEM I substitution.

Many researchers have studied these fibers for non-structural applications. However, for civil engineering structural applications, in depth behavior of wheat straw reinforced concrete (WSRC) with steel rebars is not known. For this purpose, WSRC needs to be explored in detail for load bearing structures. This paper presents the contribution of plant fibers (i.e. wheat straw) in improving the behavior and capacity of reinforced concrete for structural applications. Reinforced concrete beam-lets with varying flexure and shear rebars, without and with inclusion of wheat straw, are experimentally investigated for studying the altered behavior due to fibers. In addition, to start with the practical implications, concrete pavements are considered. The study is concluded with an increase in flexural strength (up to 7.5%), energy absorption (up to 30.4%), and toughness indices (up to 11.1%) along with better crack arresting mechanism by incorporation of wheat straw in reinforced concrete. Also, concrete pavement containing wheat straw has comparable design with likely more durable and sustainable structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018

The proposed fluorogypsum-based blend is durable in water and has a lower weight and lower cost than ordinary concrete. A preliminary investigation of strength and durability properties of this new construction material is also presented. A series of compressive strength tests and volumetric expansion measurements were conducted on specimens after 28 days of curing. The experimental results were used to develop response surface models. These models can be used to predict accurately compressive strength and volumetric expansion as functions of the relative content, in dry weight, of different components. The response surface models were employed to determine ranges of dry components of the system with sufficient strength and limited volumetric expansion. A composition with 62% pH-adjusted fluorogypsum, 35% fly ash, and 3% Portland cement was selected based on strength and volumetric expansion properties to conduct additional experimental studies to quantify its modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio, setting times, density, void contents, and curing time effects on strength and volumetric expansion.

The assessment was geographically located in Colombia, South America, and estimates the transport distances of the construction materials. The results show that transportation and reinforcing materials significantly contribute to the environmental impact, whereas the engineered bamboo construction system has the lowest environmental impact. The adoption of bamboo-based construction systems has a significant potential to support the regenerative development of regions where they could be used and might lead to long-lasting improvements to economies, environments, and livelihoods.",2018

The porous nature of concrete can make the collection and genotyping of biological fluids, such as blood, challenging. Forensic evidence can become embedded within the matrix, potentially reducing the amount of DNA available for analysis. In forensic science, ""direct"" amplification refers to a genotyping method that amplifies a DNA profile directly from a sample without DNA extraction, saving time and money. We investigated a novel application of Whatman (TM) FTA (TM) Elute cards in their ability to directly amplify PowerPlex (R) Fusion and Y23 profiles from minute amounts of blood that had been deposited on different concrete structures. In comparison to traditional collection methods, directly profiling blood stained construction materials using FTA (TM) Elute cards increased the percentage loci amplified and significantly improved both allele peak height and peak height ratio while reducing allelic drop-out. FTA (TM) Elute cards can provide a reliable, inexpensive and superior alternative to traditional methods.",2018
Experimental Investigation on Engineering Properties of Concrete Incorporating Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement and Rice Husk Ash,slump; compacting factor; density; water absorption; sorptivity; durability; compressive strength; tensile splitting strength; volumes of permeable void spaces,SUPPLEMENTARY CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS; DURABILITY CHARACTERISTICS; PORTLAND-CEMENT; PART II; STRENGTH; TRANSPORT; INDUSTRY; MIXES,"Waste generation from agricultural and construction industries is growing at an upsetting rate that causes a heavy burden on landfill facilities. On the other hand, the construction industry is exhausting natural resources thereby posing environmental problems. This study investigates the potential use of agro-industrial waste such as rice husk ash (RHA) and construction waste like reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) as promising construction materials. The durability and physical and mechanical properties of concrete were assessed by partially replacing cement and virgin aggregates with RHA and RAP, up to 20% and 50%, respectively. A total of 22 mixes were studied, twelve of which were devoted to studying the collective effects of RHA and RAP on the engineering properties of concrete. Based on experimental results, RHA and RAP decreased slump, compacting factor, density, water absorption and sorptivity. RHA increased compressive and tensile splitting strength, whereas RAP decreased compressive and tensile splitting strength. Comparable strength and favorable sorptivity values were obtained when 15% RHA was combined with up to 20% RAP in the concrete mix. Thus, utilizing RHA and RAP as concrete ingredients can contribute to solid waste management, engineering and economic benefits.",2018
A note on the impact resistance of concrete target against rigid projectile,Concrete; projectile; impact resistance; coarse aggregate; cavity expansion,NON-DEFORMABLE PROJECTILE; PENETRATION DEPTH; DEEP PENETRATION; RODS; DECELERATION; PERFORATION,"Concrete is an inhomogeneous cementitious composite which mainly consists of the cement matrix and the random distributed coarse aggregates. As for the most widely used construction materials of the protective structures designed to withstand the intentional or accidental impact loadings caused by high-speed projectiles, the impact resistance of concrete target against the rigid projectile impact is mainly dependent on the mass, density, impact velocity, diameter, and nose shape of the projectile, as well as strength and density of the target, and hardness and size of the coarse aggregates. However, the above influential parameters are not sufficiently considered in the existing cavity expansion-based model and constant resistance model for predicting the depth of penetration of a projectile. In this article, the influences of the hardness and size of the coarse aggregates on the depth of penetration are examined through the existing experimental data, and an improved rigid projectile penetration model for concrete target is proposed and validated by 19 sets of ogive- and flat-nosed projectile penetration tests.",2018
Ceramic waste powder an alternative cement replacement - Characterization and evaluation,Ceramic waste powder; Strength activity index; Cement replacement; Workability retention; Durability; Performance index,CORROSION-RESISTANCE; POLISHING POWDER; CONCRETE; RESIDUES,"In a rapidly growing world population and toward meeting consumers' needs, solid waste landfills will continue receiving extensive volumes of waste. Transforming large amount of solid wastes into an alternative resource will preserve the reducing nonrenewable resources of materials; maintain the required energy and in addition will help solve environmental and exhausted landfill problems. The utilization of solid waste materials in concrete, which is a predominant construction material, has attracted numerous studies especially those that can replace cement which is a major contributor to global green-house gas emissions. Ceramic tiles industry generates ceramic waste powder during the final polishing process. Ceramic waste powder (CWP) can cause soil, water and air pollution. Using ceramic waste powder (CWP) as an alternative ingredient in concrete will have a positive environmental impact. The aim of this study was to characterize the CWP with respect to its composition, morphology and activity. Also, the study evaluated the use of CWP as an alternative ingredient partially replacing cement on the performance of fresh and hardened concrete. In this investigation, concrete mixtures incorporating CWP as cement replacement with different replacement levels (i.e., 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% by mass) were examined. Three concrete grades with different cement contents were used (i.e., 25 MPa, 50 MPa and 75 MPa). The fresh concrete workability retention of the mixtures was evaluated by measuring time to reach zero slump. Compressive strength development with age (i.e., 7, 28 and 90 days) and drying shrinkage strain at 120 days were measured. The chloride ion penetration (i.e., rapid chloride ion penetration test - RCPT) and bulk electrical resistivity were conducted to evaluate durability performance of the mixtures. The permeable pores were measured to assess the development in the concrete microstructure. Test results showed that CWP has potential to be used as an ingredient in concrete mixtures to partially replace cement. The study showed that concrete mixtures with ceramic waste powder (CWP) had variable performance of the measured properties depending on the replacement level used. In general, CWP can be used in concrete mixtures to partially replace cement and improve specific performance criteria. A performance index (PI) approach was developed in order to be able to select the suitable CWP replacement level to optimize the mixture's specific properties to achieve a desired performance criteria. In this study, the PI considered workability retention, compressive strength and durability as performance measures for selecting the most suitable CWP replacement level. The PI could be extended to include additional criteria. The use of 10% CWP replacement level was adequate for strength improvement, replacement levels between 10% and 20% could be used to improve workability retention while a level of 40% replacement was needed for durability enhancement. For more than one performance criteria the CWP replacement level varied; a 10% to 20% CWP was suitable for optimizing the workability retention and strength of the mixture. However, the use of 30% to 40% CWP would optimize the combination of all studied criteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2018
Flexural behaviour of steel hollow sections filled with concrete that contains OPBC as coarse aggregate,,STRUCTURAL LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE; HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; PALM OIL CLINKER; TUBULAR COLUMNS; STUB COLUMNS; AXIAL-COMPRESSION; TUBES; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE; WASTE,"Oil-palm-boiler clinker (OPBC) is an agricultural waste from the palm oil industry and is considered a serious threat to the environment. Moreover, the high consumption of concrete as a construction material results in a continuous demand for natural aggregates, thereby negatively affecting the environment. Thus, channeling OPBC waste materials into the concrete industry aids in promoting the use of a sustainable and lightweight member. This research presents a novel sustainable composite beam that uses an OPBC as a replacement of the natural coarse aggregate. Flexural behaviour of steel tubes infilled with conventional and OPBC concretes were investigated. The results showed that the ductility, flexural stiffness and structural efficiency were higher in the OPBC concrete filled steel tube (CFST) than conventional CFST by 15%, 12% and 20%, respectively. Furthermore, in comparison to conventional CFST, the 10% less self-weight in OPBC CFST will significantly reduce the construction cost of the material. Conclusively, the utilisation of OPBC as infill material for CFSTs will solve disposal problem, preserve natural resources, reduce environmental pollution and will make the structural system sustainable.

However, technical challenges needs to be addressed for the industrial implementation of AM, e.g. materials formulation standardization, and interfacial bonding quality between the deposited layers amongst others. AM as one of the most highlighted key enabling technologies has the potential to create disruptive solutions, the key for its successful implementation is multidisciplinary effort in synergy involving materials science, architecture/design, computation, and robotics. There are crucial links between the material design formulations and the printing system for the manufacturing of the complex 3D geometries.

Assessing the individual and combined effects of uncertainty and variability sources in comparative LCA of pavements,Asphalt pavement; Concrete pavement; Data quality; Methodological choices; Monte Carlo simulation; Technological variability; Uncertainty analysis,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; WARM MIX ASPHALT; PARAMETER UNCERTAINTY; RECLAIMED ASPHALT; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; CARBON FOOTPRINT; ROAD; CONSTRUCTION; METHODOLOGY; SENSITIVITY,"Several efforts have attempted to incorporate the sources of uncertainty and variability into the life cycle assessment (LCA) of pavements. However, no method has been proposed that can simultaneously consider data quality, methodological choices, and variability in inputs and outputs without the need for complementary software. This study aims to develop and implement a flexible method that can be used in the LCA software to assess the effects of these sources on the conclusions. A Monte Carlo analysis was conducted and applied in a comparative LCA of pavements to assess the preferred scenario. The uncertainty of the results was first estimated by considering the data quality using the ecoinvent database. Moreover, the variabilities of the materials, construction methods, and repair stages of the pavement life cycle were included in the analysis by assigning continuous uniform probability distributions to each variable. Ultimately, the probability of methodological choices was modeled using uniform distributions and assigning a portion of the area of the distribution to each scenario. The individual and combined effects of these uncertainty and variability sources were assessed in a comparative LCA of asphalt and concrete pavements in a cold region such as Quebec (Canada). The results of the Monte Carlo analysis show that the allocation choices can change the environmentally preferred scenario in four midpoint categories. These categories are significantly dominated by the crude oil supply chain. The variability in construction materials and methods can change the preferred scenario in the damage categories, namely, human health and global warming. Additionally, parameter uncertainty has a significant effect on the conclusion of the preferred scenario in ecosystem quality. The worst qualitative scores are given to the geographical uncertainty of the elementary flow that primarily contributes to this category (i.e., zinc). The simultaneous effect of the uncertainty and variability sources prevents the decision-maker from reaching a less uncertain conclusion about ecosystem quality, human health, and global warming effects. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to assess the cumulative effects of common uncertainty and variability sources using commercial LCA software, including Monte Carlo simulation. Based on the variability and uncertainty of the results, the identification of a certain conclusion is case specific at both the midpoint and endpoint levels. Increasing the quality of the inventory is one solution to decreasing the uncertainties related to human health, ecosystem quality, and global warming regarding pavement LCA. This improvement can be achieved by avoiding the adaptation of a similar process to match the considered process and using practical construction efficiencies and realistic construction materials. The effectiveness of these tasks must be assessed in future studies. It should be noted that these conclusions were determined regardless of the uncertainty in the characterization factors of the impact assessment method.",2018
Concurrent seismic and energy retrofitting of RC and masonry building envelopes using inorganic textile-based composites combined with insulation materials: A new concept,Building envelopes; Textile reinforced mortar (TRM); Insulation materials; Combined retrofitting; Existing buildings; Seismic risk; Energy efficiency,REINFORCED-CONCRETE FRAMES; SECTOR,"This paper explores innovative techniques by combining inorganic textile-based composites with thermal insulation for the simultaneous seismic and energy retrofitting of the existing old buildings. A brief state-of-the-art review on energy and seismic retrofitting materials and techniques is initially made, followed by the introduction of a novel concept for the simultaneous seismic and energy retrofitting of the Reinforced Concrete (RC) and masonry building envelopes, combining Textile Reinforced Mortar (TRM) jacketing and thermal insulation materials or systems. The hybrid structural-plus-energy retrofitting solutions examined are based on inorganic materials providing both cost effectiveness and fire resistance for the building envelope. The overall effectiveness of the combined energy and seismic retrofitting is demonstrated via a case study on a five stories old-type RC building. Moreover by proposing a common approach based on the expected annual loss (of consumed energy or expected seismic loss), it is possible to evaluate the financial feasibility and benefits of the proposed combined retrofitting approach. It was shown that the proposed concept is economically efficient as the payback period of the intervention (return of the retrofitting investment) can be significantly reduced for seismic zones when energy is applied concurrently with seismic retrofitting by exploiting advanced construction materials, thanks to large savings related to the labour costs.",2018

The process takes advantage of the supply of carbonate ions derived from urea hydrolysis and of an increase in pH generated by the reaction, effects that in the presence of Ca2+ ions lead to the precipitation of CaCO3. Further to its importance in nature, if performed in a biomimetic manner, the urease-aided CaCO3 mineralization offers enormous potential in innovative engineering applications as an eco-friendly technique operative under mild conditions, to be used for remediation and cementation/deposition in field applications in situ. These include among others, the strengthening and consolidation of soil/sand, the protection and restoration of stone and concrete structures, conservation of stone cultural heritage materials, cleaning waste-and groundwater of toxic metals and radionuclides, and plugging geological formations for the enhancement of oil recovery and geologic CO2 sequestration. In view of the potential of this newly emerging interdisciplinary branch of engineering, this article presents the principles of urease-aided calcium carbonate mineralization apposed to other biomineralization processes, and reviews the advantages and limitations of the technique compared to the conventional techniques presently in use. Further, it presents areas of its existing and potential applications, notably in geotechnical, construction and environmental engineering, and its future perspectives.

From the viewpoint of environmental preservation and effective utilization of resources, it is beneficial and necessary to reuse C&D waste. Recycled concrete aggregate, which is obtained from C&D waste, is currently being considered as an alternative aggregate for structural concrete. Recycled aggregate concrete (RAC), an ecofriendly concrete produced by partial or full substitution of natural aggregates with recycled concrete aggregates in a concrete mix, has drawn much attention recently. Over the last decade, a significant volume of studies has been reported in the literature on the behavior of RACs. This paper summarizes the literature dealing with the mechanical properties (and the parameters affecting them) of RACs produced using coarse recycled concrete aggregates published between 1978 and 2017. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of RAC, this review takes into account more than 200 published studies. The review also discusses the less understood influences of aggregate surface treatment, aggregate moisture state, and concrete mixing on the behavior of RAC. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review dealing with all the potential influential factors affecting the mechanical properties of RAC. Hence, this review is expected to help researchers better understand the behavior of this construction material.",2018
Comparative material-based life cycle analysis of structural beam-floor systems,Life cycle analysis; LCA; ISO 14040/44; Construction materials; Beam floor system,IMPACT ASSESSMENT; EMBODIED CARBON; MIX DESIGN; CONCRETE; LCA; REFURBISHMENT; CONSTRUCTION; DIOXIDE,"In a residential building, various structural flooring systems are feasible. For moderate spans (4 m-6 m) and for a predetermined column grid, distinct combinations of wood, steel and concrete elements can be implemented as beam-floor system. Besides comparing these beam-floor systems based on weight, cost, speed of installation etc., a comparison can also be based on their environmental impact. Indeed, whereas some materials appear to be environmentally friendly for many applications, this may not be true for this particular case. For such a comparison, a life cycle assessment (LCA) according to ISO 14040/44 has been implemented in this paper. In this study, the functional unit consists of a square meter of a structural beam-floor system of an arbitrary composition, i.e. three main beam materials (concrete, steel and wood) have been combined with appropriate structural floor systems. The paper presents the results of the LCAs for different impact categories, and both midpoint and endpoint assessment methods. This provides a broad idea of the environmental profile of the considered beam-floor systems representative for current Belgian building practice for the defined functional unit. Furthermore, the influence of the respective impact assessment methods (ReCiPe World versus Europe) was found to be important, especially regarding wooden structural elements. Lastly, some sensitivity analyses (use of recycled aggregates, use of aerated concrete waste, transport types and distances, ratio virgin-recycled steel) have been performed in order to obtain a more nuanced view on the setup and results of this study. These sensitivity analyses show that mainly the ratio virgin-recycled steel in a beam-floor system can result in widely varying impacts on the environment and thus give some opportunities for improved environmental impact.

In the process of enhancement of the properties of geopolymer; engineered geopolymer composite (EGC) is a recent development that is classified as the high-performance fiber reinforced geopolymer matrix. The philosophy of the development of EGC is to achieve high compressive strength and ductility. In this paper, statistical models are developed to predict the mechanical and post-cracking properties of EGC using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). In this regard, effects of three principal variables; molarity of sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratio, and curing temperature on the properties of fresh and hardened EGC (setting time, compressive strength, elastic modulus, flexural strength, flexural toughness, ductility index, tensile strength, tensile first crack strength and tensile strain capacity) were investigated. All models are found significant because, and the difference between predicted R-2 and adjustable R-2 was found less than 0.2. The optimized mixture proportion was assessed using multi objective optimization technique as discussed in the RSM literature. Finally, an experimental program was performed to validate the optimized mixture proportion. The predicted and experimental results were found in a close agreement because the variation between the predicted and the experimental results was obtained less than 5%. The proposed method can be performed for any objective value of the EGC property with desirability almost equal to one, improving the yield, the reliability of the product and the processes.

Sustainable use of ash as a construction material must be predicted on ensuring that potentially harmful environmental impacts arising from its heavy metals fraction are avoided. This paper assesses the globally available experimental results on the leaching of SSA and when used in cement clinker production, lightweight aggregate production, mortar, concrete, blocks, road pavements, geotechnics and ceramics. The data analysis indicates that although the material itself is not classified as inert, the mobility of the heavy metals can be heavily restricted in many of these construction products. This can be attributed to solidification/stabilisation effects of Portland cement, supplementary cementing materials or clay, whilst high temperature treatments involved in lightweight aggregate and ceramics production are also beneficial. Restrictions on the use of SSA are also endorsed to avoid strongly unfavourable conditions, such as high rainfall-high seepage areas and severely acidic environments.",2018
Durability performance of concrete incorporating waste metalized plastic fibres and palm oil fuel ash,Fibre reinforced concrete; Waste metalized plastic fibres; Palm oil fuel ash; Durability performance; Drying shrinkage,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; TEREPHTHALATE PET PARTICLES; POLYPROPYLENE CARPET FIBERS; GREEN CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; IMPACT RESISTANCE; SILICA FUME; HIGH-VOLUME; FLY-ASH; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES,"With the rising quantity of waste generation from numerous processes, there has been growing attention in the consumption of waste materials in the production of construction materials to attain possible advantages. In this study, the durability performance of concrete comprising waste metalized plastic (WMP) fibres and palm oil fuel ash (POFA) was investigated. Properties studied include air content of fresh concrete in addition to sorptivity, water absorption, chloride penetration, and drying shrinkage of hardened concrete. Six concrete mixes containing 0-1.25% WMP fibres with a length of 20 mm were cast for ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Further, six concrete batches with the same fibre content were made, where 20% POFA substituted OPC. The incorporation of WMP fibres and POFA increased the air content of concrete mixtures. Furthermore, water absorption, sorptivity, and chloride penetration of concrete reinforced with WMP fibres were reduced with volume fractions of up to 0.75% for both OPC and POFA-based mixtures. The positive interaction amongst WMP fibres and POFA consequently led to the reduction in drying shrinkage of the concrete. The influence of POFA on the durability performance of concrete was noticed to be more significant at longer curing periods. The results of the study revealed that there is a promising future for the utilisation of WMP fibres in the production of sustainable and durable concrete. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Coal combustion ash was utilized as pozzolanic mineral additive. The binders' mix-design was supplemented with sorptive clays to prevent migration of toxic elements from fly ash. The experiment was established on the premise of clay's ion-exchanging ability. Ten binders comprising cement CEM I 42.5 and fly ash, zeolite and/or bentonite additions were prepared in accordance with chemometric experimental design rules. Chemical composition was determined via XRF method. The changes in mineral phases and crystallinity were traced by X-ray diffraction. Hydration mechanisms and thermal behavior were investigated via DTA/TGA. The chemical bonds were identified by FTIR. Morphology of hardened samples was detected by SEM. Mathematical tools employed data sets of instrumental analyses to form a clear differentiation between binders and to assess changes caused by adoption of mineral additives in the mix designs. Sorptive clays showed pozzolanic behavior, thereby causing no incapacitation to the cement hydration mechanism, and classifying as a possible economical resources which can be used in production technology of construction materials to redeem environmental pollution issues of building industry.

Sustainable use of waste in flexible pavement: A review,"Sustainable development; Construction, and demolition; Recycled asphalt concrete; Quarry waste; Flexible pavement",HOT-MIX ASPHALT; STONE MASTIC ASPHALT; BLACK COTTON SOIL; RICE HUSK ASH; RECYCLED CONCRETE; FLY-ASH; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; DEMOLITION WASTE; STABILIZATION; LIME,"Around the world flexible pavement is the most favored pavement structure to build road and highways. A massive amount of non-renewable materials and industrial products like aggregates, bitumen, cement, lime, and other additives are consumed during construction and maintenance of this pavement system. Extraction and production of these virgin materials is an unsustainable practice. Wastage of materials, environmental deterioration, depletion of resources, and the spike in material cost led researchers to search for alternative materials that can be used in flexible pavement. This paper provides an overview of such recycled materials that have been successfully used in different layers of flexible pavements. Studies have established that the use of secondary material not only provide an efficient waste disposal technique but also reduce demand for conventional material and reduce overall construction cost. Through this paper, an attempt has also been made to identify the reason because of which, despite having essential studies, their field implementation has been limited and suggest possible remedies by which use of recycled material in the flexible pavement can be promoted.

Salt hydrates are corrosive and hygroscopic but cheap. A suitable salt hydrate encapsulation material would be of great interest to the construction industry. Thus, macroencapsulation can be a possible and cheap opportunity. Therefore, different methods to macroencapsulate phase change material, consisting of 50 wt% MgCl2 x 6H(2)O and 50 wt% CaCl2 x 6H(2)O, were investigated. The investigation results show that the foils with a layer of aluminum or polyvinylidene chloride and liquid spar varnish with additives (mica, graphite, glass flakes) are suitable materials. Furthermore, liquid rubber (Noxyde((R))), liquid EPDM (ethylene propylene diene (M-class)) and liquid polyvinylidene chloride as well as butyl rubber as extruded tape, malleable modelling clay or injectable mass were tested. These materials are also usable, whereas liquid two-component polysulfide and other foils are not suitable. In conclusion, the supplier can decide to use foils or liquid materials based on the application, the construction material and the price. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
"A sustainable replacement for TiO2 in photocatalyst construction materials: Hydroxyapatite-based photocatalytic additives, made from the valorisation of food wastes of marine origin",Sustainable material; Photocatalysis; Hydroxyapatite; Waste valorisation; Construction material; NHL mortar,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PHOSPHATE-BASED MATERIALS; TITANIUM-DIOXIDE; VISIBLE-LIGHT; CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS; AGRICULTURAL WASTES; BUILDING-MATERIALS; NANO-TITANIA; DEGRADATION; CONCRETE,"The use of waste materials and by-products in building materials is of increasing importance to improve sustainability in construction, as is the incorporation of photocatalytic materials to both combat atmospheric pollution and protect the structures and fa ades. This work reports the innovative use of photocatalytic hydroxyapatite (HAp) based powders, derived from Atlantic codfish bone wastes, as an additive to natural hydraulic lime mortars. HAp is the main component of bone, and hence is non-toxic and biocompatible. This is the first time that such a calcium phosphate-based photocatalyst, or indeed any fish/marine derived wastes, have been added to building materials. A key factor is that this HApbased photocatalyst contains only 1 wt% TiO2, the material usually used as a photocatalyst in construction materials. As we only add 1-5 wt% of our total HAp-based material to the mortar, this means our photocatalytic mortars only contain 0.01-0.05 wt% titania (100-500 ppm), two orders of magnitude less than the quantities of 2-10 wt% TiO2 which are usually needed. Our photocatalyst is made from a sustainable waste stream by simple solution and thermal processing, and thus with a much smaller impact on the environment. Specimens were made by either traditional intermixing techniques, or by a post -curing coating procedure. All showed gas-phase photocatalytic activity for abatement of NO pollutants under solar light. With intermixing, NOx abatement of 6.3-8.3% was observed. However, for coated mortars, superior NOx conversion rates were achieved of 7.1% and 23.8%, with 1 and 5 wt% additions, respectively.

Recycling paper industry effluent sludge for use in mortars: A sustainability perspective,Industrial waste; Mortar; Sustainability; Effluent sludge; Paper industry,MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; CEMENT-BASED MORTARS; WATER-RETENTION; FLY-ASH; MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATION; CONSTRUCTION-INDUSTRY; POZZOLANIC ACTIVITY; DEMOLITION WASTE; HYDRATION; CONCRETE,"The paper and cellulose manufacturing industry generates significant quantities of waste, including an extremely humid sludge, which is considered to be an effluent with high environmental liability for the manufacturer. Studies have shown that this waste sludge may be utilized in construction material, such as mortar for fixing blocks, as well as for ceiling and wall coatings that use ceramic masonry as a sealant. The recycling of pulp and paper industry waste sludge has important environmental benefits, by preventing soil and water pollution caused by inadequate disposal and by reducing the depletion of natural resources, such as lime, used in cementitious materials. This study analyzed the sustainability of incorporating such waste into cement-based mortars. Tests were conducted replacing lime, one of the most expensive mortar components with high environmental impact, with waste sludge in contents of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%. Analysis was then performed on the samples to assess the primary technical characteristics of these incorporated mortars, such as the consistency index, heat of hydration, content of incorporated air, water retention, mechanical strength and the capillarity coefficient. The results were compared with the results of the characterization tests that were performed on the waste material. The results showed that for use in wall and ceiling mortar coatings, the level of incorporation should not exceed 10%, because higher levels yield lower values of mechanical strength resistance, incompatible with market requirements. This result is probably due to the low heat of hydration of the waste material which generates slower reactions. On the other hand, higher levels of waste material content, above 10%, are appropriate convenient for mortar used to fill small repairs in masonry that do not require control of properties.

The primary objective is to provide data that allow knowing the environmental behavior of walls built with materials and practices conventionally. This type of analysis will enable promoting the creation of regulations that encourage the use of combinations of materials that generate the most environmentally suitable result, and in turn, contribute to the strengthening of the embodied stages study of buildings and their elements. The results indicate that the greatest impact arises in the product stage (90.9%), followed by the transport stage (8.9%) and the construction process stage (<1%). Strategies (such as the use of large-format pieces and the controlled increase in thickness of the thermal insulation) can contribute to reducing the environmental impact; on the contrary, practices such as the use of small-format pieces and laminated plasterboard can increase the environmental burden. The prediction of the environmental behavior (simulation equation) allows these possible impacts to be studied in a fast and simplified way.",2018

Along with the increasing economic needs in the development of construction, precast technology has become a primary solution that leads to the industrialization. The use of precast concrete system offers several advantages, such as rapid erection, higher product quality, lower project cost, better sustainability, and improved occupational health and safety. In general, there are two casting methods used in concrete placement, namely wet-and dry-castings. The dry-cast concrete has also been used for its advantages particularly in precast concrete industries, e.g. its rapid hardening time for fast mold removal (it significantly increases the plant productivity). The use of Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) as a replacement to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) has become increasingly popular for the past decade. Hence, its application in dry-cast method needs to be further investigated for its mechanical properties such as its compressive and splitting tensile strengths. An experimental work was carried out to examine the properties of dry-cast concrete using both types of cements (PPC and OPC). The development of its compressive strength was also monitored at 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 days of age. The splitting test was conducted to describe the tensile strength of dry-cast concrete. The observation of crack and failure behaviour of all concrete specimens were also carried out.",2018

Basalt fibre is one of those materials that is currently gaining interest in concrete production, because it is environmentally friendly, and also has good mechanical features. The current study evaluates the workability, strength properties, impact resistance and hydration characteristics of high strength chopped basalt fibre-reinforced concrete. Basalt fibre was used in varying proportions, and manufactured sand was used as a total replacement of natural fine aggregate, while other natural materials were kept constant, when casting concrete specimens. The results showed that increasing the cut length of basalt fibre could enhance the strength characteristics and impact resistance of concrete. Overall, the study revealed an improved impact resistance in the tested concrete, which could be traced to be a result of rapid hydration.",2018

Potential sources of these contaminants in runoff are endogenous to the urban watershed and are mainly related to traffic and leaching from construction materials. This article summarizes the results of experimental work carried out on a selection of building materials, automotive materials, and consumables, which can be in contact with rain, to assess their potential emission of alkylphenols, alkylphenol ethoxylates, and bisphenol A into runoff. 36 samples of materials, new and used, across 7 major families of building materials (PVC, concrete, polycarbonate, SBS-modified bitumen, drainage materials) and automotive materials (body, tires) were subjected to leaching tests with methanol and then, for a selection of them, with water. Automotive fluids were also directly analyzed. The results demonstrate the ubiquitous presence of APs and BPA in urban materials and their extractable character with water. The compounds with the strongest emission rates were bisphenol A and nonylphenol. The most important BPA emissions into water (10 to 300 ng/g) were measured for polycarbonate, tires, some car bodies, and PVC. Nonylphenol was leached in large quantities (1 to 10 ng/g) from PVC, some concretes, SBS-modified bitumen, and body samples. The tires were the only materials having a strong emission in octylphenol (1 to 10 ng/g). The analysis of automotive fluids confirmed the presence of BPA (0.3 to 5.5 g/L) and nonylphenol (2.3 to 2.9 mg/L) in brake fluids, while APs and BPA were found at trace levels in coolants and windscreen washer.",2018

For the slag activation, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets and the mixture of NaOH+liquid sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) were used at three sodium concentrations, 4%, 6% and 8% by mass of slag. Twenty one different mixtures were prepared for the laboratory tests. In the reference three mixtures, OPC was used as binder and in the other AAS mixtures Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) was used. The binder dosages were 300, 350 and 400 kg/m(3) and the waterbinder (w/b) ratio used in the mixtures was 0.50. The compressive strength and hydration temperature of produced concretes were measured. The temperature change of specimens measured in every 15 minutes until 120 hours. The test results showed that, the compressive strengths and hydration temperatures of the mixtures increased depending on increasing binder amount and sodium dosage. The use of NaOH+Na2SiO3 mixture as activator increased compressive strength but decreased hydration temperature of the mixtures. The hydration temperatures of all AAS mixtures were lower than OPC mixtures. Produced AAS concrete with low hydration temperature can be an alternative in recycled construction material at mass concrete applications.",2018

Therefore, this study presents a comparison of the production of self-compacting concrete containing mineral admixtures in a Brazilian context. To compare mixtures fairly, it is necessary to use indicators that incorporate all the relevant aspects; therefore, two environmental impact indicators were used, considering mechanical strength and service life (SL) as parameters. The concrete mixtures studied contained ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) and fly ash at replacement levels of 20, 30, and 40%. Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a method that can be used to quantify the environmental impact of a product throughout its life cycle. SimaPro software was used as a tool to perform the LCA. To assess the durability of concrete, the SL of each mixture was estimated using Life-365 software. The difference in the clinker transportation of different cement suppliers was an important parameter in the analysis. Based on all of the indicators analyzed, it was concluded that utilization of the highest GGBFS content in the cement was the environmentally preferable solution.",2018

The higher electromagnetic shielding values are obtained for panels containing over 15% metallic fibers and those reinforced with grids with a sieve area below 150 mm(2). Depending on the type and percentage of additive or reinforcement included, frequency-dependent behaviors have been observed within the measured spectrum, which encompasses the frequency range used in modern communications systems.

Specifically, the synergistic effects of carbon nanotube and carbon fiber on the heat generation and electrical characteristics of cementitious composites were experimentally investigated. The test results show that the addition of carbon fiber improved the heat generation capability and the electrical stability of the cementitious composites incorporating CNT during heating. The long-term durability of construction materials is an important issue, however, there is a practical limit to measuring a property of specimen for a very long time in a laboratory level experiment. In addition, a modified micromechanical model was proposed here to estimate the long-term effect of heating on the electrical characteristics of cementitious composites. The model parameters were derived from the experimental results, and a series of numerical simulations was conducted to explore the influence of model parameters on the resistance of the composites. Comparisons between experimental data and the present predictions were made to assess the potential of the proposed model. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH MODELLING OF CONCRETE MIXED WITH FLY ASH AND WASTE CERAMICS USING k-NEAREST NEIGHBOR ALGORITHM,Compressive strength; waste utilization; fly ash; ceramics; nearest neighbor,,"Excessive materials are being manufactured, and along with it are the waste products that are being produced due to the rapid growth of industries. In the Philippines, wastes such as fly ash and damaged ceramics are being considered as a construction material since there are recent researches that proved their properties are comparable to cement and aggregates. In this study, compressive strength tests (ASTM C 39) were conducted to obtain the compressive strength of the concrete mixed with varying amounts fly ash and waste ceramics. Moreover, specimens were also subjected to varying days of curing to assess their strength development. Due to the availability of a wide range of data, machine learning model, such as the k-nearest neighbor, were also considered; it can predict an unknown target parameter without consuming tremendous time and resources. Thus, this study aimed to provide a k-nearest neighbor model that will serve as a reference to predict the compressive strength of concrete while incorporating waste ceramic tiles as a replacement to coarse aggregates while varying the amount of fly ash as a partial substitute to cement. The k-nearest neighbor model used was validated to ensure the predictions are acceptable.",2018

Most of previous investigations have reported that the BFS has been used as traditional construction materials (cement, roadbed filling, concrete). In this study, a novel use route for BFS was proposed to prepare high-temperature composite phase change materials (C-PCMs) for thermal energy storage. Three typical inorganic PCMs (NaN0(3), Al and Na(2)S0(4) with different operating temperature) were blended with the pre-ground BFS to fabricate BFS-based C-PCMs by means of a mixing and sintering process. The results showed that NaN0(3) had excellent chemical compatibility with BFS and the prepared C-PCMs had perfect phase change performance. The enthalpies of NaN0(3)/BFS C-PCMs was 65.53 J/g with melting point 300.5 degrees C and the super-cooling was only 0.1 degrees C Furthermore, the NaN0(3)/BFS C-PCMs could retain good thermal reliability after 100 thermal cycles, which presented a potential application in the thermal energy storage system. In addition, the morphological structure, thermal reliability and heat transfer property of the NaN0(3)/BFS C-PCMs were characterised by using SEM, TGA and TG-DSC.

Carbonation characteristics of gamma-dicalcium silicate for low-carbon building material,gamma-Dicalcium silicate; Accelerated carbonation; Calcium carbonate; Ca-modified silica gel; Co-2 emission,CEMENT-BASED MATERIALS; ACCELERATED CARBONATION; SUPERCRITICAL CO2; CONCRETE; EMISSIONS; DURABILITY; REACTIVITY; FORSTERITE; SHRINKAGE; PRODUCTS,"gamma-Dicalcium silicate (gamma-C2S) is characterized by its high carbonation reactivity and has the potential to be utilized as a construction material with the added benefit of CO2 sequestration. The present work addresses the characteristics of pressure-molded gamma-C2S samples subjected to accelerated carbonation curing, including the developments in microstructure, carbonation degree and mechanical strength. The results indicate that the mechanical strength and surface density of carbonated gamma-C2S block correlate well with its carbonation degree, which is attributed to the generation of more voluminous carbonation products. This strengthens the structure and densities the matrix. The carbonation products include calcite as the primary morphology and aragonite as the minor phase, and amorphous Ca-modified silica gel formed by coordinated SiO4 tetrahedrons. Conductivity and ion concentration measurement elucidates the accelerated Ca2+ ion dissolution in the presence of CO2 is the reason for the high carbonation reactivity of gamma-C2S. A conceptual model of carbonation process is proposed based on the distribution of Camodified silica gel and calcium carbonates. Additionally, the ecological evaluation demonstrates that gamma-C2S would hopefully reduce 40% of the CO2 emissions compared to ordinary cement, which opens up a new area of a novel low-carbon construction material.

Electrical and thermal characterisation of cement-based mortars containing recycled metallic waste,Cement-based mortars; Metallic waste; Ultrasonic time; Electrical resistivity; Thermal conductivity; Self-monitoring,FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STEEL; COMPOSITES; CARBON; RESISTIVITY; PERFORMANCE; RESISTANCE; BEHAVIOR; DAMAGE,"y The management and disposal of solid waste from industrial sources is a problem around the world. In recent years, several studies have been carried out to develop advanced construction materials based on the waste valorisation. As a result, building materials with self-healing and self-monitoring properties have been developed using electrically conductive metallic waste. Nevertheless, the addition of metallic waste may influence the electrical and thermal performance of the new building materials. This paper aims to evaluate the effect of the type and content of metallic waste (steel fibres and steel shavings) on the volumetric, electrical, and thermal properties of cement-based mortars designed with self monitoring purposes. Physical, electrical, and thermal properties of cement-based mortars with four different contents of metallic waste were evaluated by measuring their bulk density, porosity, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity. In addition, metallic waste distribution inside the mortar specimens was measured by ultrasonic tests. All the properties were measured on specimens at two curing ages, 7 and 28 days. The main results showed that the addition of metallic waste produced a reduction of the bulk density and an increase of the porosity of cement-based mortars. Furthermore, it was proven that it is possible to evaluate the metallic waste distribution inside the mortars by ultrasound, and that this evaluation is more effective in specimens with fibres than in those with shavings. Likewise, it was proven that metallic waste can modify the electrical resistivity and the thermal conductivity of mortars, regardless of the type and amount of metallic waste. Finally, it was concluded that both the type and amount of metallic waste, and the curing time used in this research did not present a significant influence on the variation of the electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of the evaluated cement based mortars.

In this study, a finite element model is developed for the simulation of structural responses of UHPFRC panels subjected to blast loads. Based on the available experimental data, the procedures for the material model calibration are presented. The effect of strain rate on the dynamic material properties is reviewed, and the formula of dynamic increase factor is selected and proposed based on the steel fibre dosage and matrix strength. The developed finite element model is validated by comparing the numerical predictions with the test results from literature. In addition, a parametric study is carried out to investigate the effects of steel reinforcement ratios and the blast scenarios on the resistance of UHPFRC panels, and the advantages of using UHPFRC in protective structures are demonstrated by the comparison against high strength reinforced concrete panels.

Performance of concrete beams reinforced with basalt fibre composite rebar,Basalt rebar; BFRP; Reinforced concrete beam; Shear; Flexure; Deformability,POLYMER,"Basalt fibre reinforced polymer (BFRP) rebar is an emerging green construction material. In this research, performance of concrete beams reinforced with BFRP rebar has been evaluated. Full-scale tests on eight large-scale concrete beam specimens reinforced with either BFRP rebars or steel rebars were undertaken. The test data were analysed to evaluate the performance of BFRP rebar reinforced concrete beams in shear and flexure. It was found that at a low reinforcement ratio, BFRP rebar reinforced beams exhibited more flexural and shear cracking than counterpart steel rebar reinforced concrete beams. It was also found that BFRP reinforced beams exhibited acceptable deformability according to CSA S6-14. Cracking moments were found to be 30-50% higher for steel rebar reinforced specimens, compared to BFRP rebar reinforced specimens. The study also found that shear failure can govern the design of BFRP rebar reinforced concrete beams containing BFRP stirrups, and that V-c is 30-40% less for BFRP reinforced beams. The CSA S806-12 standard was found to be conservative in predicting V-c.

Co-complexation effects during incineration bottom ash leaching via comparison of measurements and geochemical modeling,IBA pH; Co-complexation; Geochemical modeling; Metal leaching,WASTE INCINERATION; HEAVY-METALS; FLY-ASH; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; TRACE-ELEMENTS; METHYL-ORANGE; BEHAVIOR; SPECIATION; CONCRETE,"Under the proper setting of boundaries, leaching behaviors of incineration bottom ashes (IBA) may be predicted using geochemical models. The extent of agreement between measurements and the prediction is often affected by the model development. On the other hand, the inconsistency may also be caused by the complexity of the system for modeling. As such, discrepancies between measurements and geochemical modeling on IBA leaching would indicate uncovered yet significant mechanisms which may not be fully understood by the existing setting scenarios. pH-static leaching tests of IBA were performed, followed by simulations with two geochemical models. Simulations based on the surface area calculated with all leachable minerals provided a better matching with experimental data as compared to that calculated with surface area of Fe/Al oxides only. Yet, certain elements remained highly overestimated (up to 3 orders of magnitude, e.g. Cd, Ni, Sr, Zn, Fe, Al and Mg) or underestimated (e.g. Cr) in alkaline pH range. Significant co-complexation during leaching may be susceptible and responsible for the differences. Multivariate factor analysis testified that pH, Fe and Al in acidic environment tended to be clustered and highly loaded under the dominant correlation factor (accounting for 33.3-49.0% of variance). Contrastively, pH, Ca and cationic strength in alkaline environment tended to be clustered and highly loaded under the dominant correlation factor (accounting for 39.9-43.3% of variance). In both cases, cocomplexation was evidenced. As the natural pHs of IBA usually fall within the high alkaline range, the comparison study offered quantitative discrimination of leaching potential between measurements and simulation, which would be crucial for decision making during IBA applications. In light of limited leaching potential of IBA under the alkaline pH range, its application with cement (with high alkalinity) seems to be one of the best options. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A study of alkali-activated concrete mixes with ground granulated blast furnace slag,alkali activated cement concrete; ground granulated blast furnace slag; green construction materials; solid waste management,HYDRATION; STRENGTH,"The paper presents a laboratory study of concrete mixes based on the alkali-activation of an industrial by-product, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS). A number of factors potentially affecting the resulting concrete quality in terms of workability and strengths were investigated (namely activator type, molarity, curing conditions and times). The statistical significance of the effect of these factors was supported by ANOVA. Higher workability and strengths (with lower activator concentrations) were obtained for KOH containing mixes. Curing at constant moisture and ambient temperature was successful for most alkaline activators and mixes, which showed good concrete strengths at all curing times; when Na2SiO3 was used in addition to NaOH or KOH activators of moderate to high molarity, strengths exceeded those of Ordinary Portland Cement (CEM-I) concrete of a similar water/cement ratio.",2018
Influence of Rice Straw Fibers on Concrete Strength and Drying Shrinkage,natural fibers; rice straw fibers; drying shrinkage; concrete strength; heat of hydration,CEMENT MORTAR COMPOSITES; DURABILITY,"Fibers have been used in construction materials for centuries. This study investigated the impact of the addition of rice straw fibers (RSF) on the compressive and flexural strengths of concrete, drying shrinkage, and on the heat of cement hydration. RSF was saturated before being added to concrete. Addition of RSF in concrete reduced concrete strength, increased concrete drying shrinkage, and increased the induction period of cement hydration. It was suggested that water squeezed out of RSF during mixing and sample consolidation increased effective water-to-cement ratios (w/c) and resulted in reduction of concrete strength and increase of concrete drying shrinkage. The increase of retardation time was attributed to leaching of organic and inorganic compounds out of RSF into the pore solution. It was shown that samples containing washed RSF did not have noticeable improvement in compressive strength over samples containing unwashed (as received) RSF. However, samples containing washed RSF had lower drying shrinkage and shorter induction period compared to those containing unwashed RSF.",2018

It has been reported that the use of FNS as a fine aggregate can improve the strength and durability properties of concrete. Use of some FNS aggregates containing reactive silica may potentially cause alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in Portland cement concrete. However, the inclusion of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) such as fly ash and blast furnace slag as partial cement replacement can effectively mitigate the ASR expansion. When finely ground FNS is used with cement, it shows pozzolanic reaction, which is similar to that of other common SCMs such as fly ash. Furthermore, 20% FNS powder blended geopolymer showed greater strength and durability properties as compared to 100% fly ash based geopolymers. The utilization of raw FNS in pavement construction is reported as a useful alternative to natural aggregate. Therefore, the use of by-product FNS in the construction industry will be a valuable step to help conservation of natural resources and add sustainability to infrastructures development. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the available results on the effects of FNS in concrete as aggregate and binder, and provides some recommendations for future research in this field.",2018
Technical and environmental performance of lower carbon footprint cement mortars containing biomass fly ash as a secondary cementitious material,Blended cement; Leaching; Biomass ash; Compressive strength; Secondary cementitious material,WOOD WASTE ASH; TRACE-ELEMENTS; BOTTOM ASH; CONCRETE; CONSTITUENTS; REPLACEMENT; BATCH; HCWA; PH,"This study evaluated the mechanical and environmental properties of cement mortars containing fly ash from biomass combustion as a secondary cementitious material. Cement mortars with 20 and 40% wt. replacement of Portland cement with fly ash from two types of installations were tested for their compressive strength and leaching behaviour. Substitution of 20% Portland cement with wood fly ash complied with the reference standard for compressive strength of 42.50 MPa at 280 days. Replacement rates of 40% developed a lower strength (30 and 33.50 MPa), but were still suitable for applications. The pulverized fuel ash perform substantially worse. We conclude that the biomass fly ash from fluidized bed combustion performs as a functional secondary cementitious material in cement, whereas the functionality of pulverized fuel fly ash is insufficient. The release of environmentally relevant elements from all the tested specimens fulfilled the Dutch leaching criteria for reuse. During second life as a granular construction material the release of Ba, Cr, Mo and V increased to a level of concern. However, this release was found to be similar to that of existing blended cements and was controlled by cement chemistry. The technical performance of cement mortars was influenced by the type and ratio of fly ash mixed with cement. However, the environmental performance was driven by the cement matrix that controlled the release of contaminants. Using biomass fly ash as a secondary cementitious material can reduce the carbon footprint of concrete by 40% while maintaining good technical and environmental performance.",2018
Stiffness of a recycled composite aggregate,,WIDE STRAIN RANGE; CONCRETE AGGREGATE; WAVE-PROPAGATION; BENDER ELEMENTS; PARTICLE-SHAPE; GRAIN-SIZE; HONG-KONG; G(MAX); TESTS; SHEAR,"Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is a promising substitute for natural aggregates and the reuse of this demolished material would benefit the construction projects both economically and environmentally. A difficulty associated with the prediction of the behavior of RCA is because of its multi-composition which is linked to the grain size in consideration. In this study, a comprehensive laboratory testing program is conducted on different fractions of RCA for which the ratio of silicon over calcium increases for the coarser fractions due to the limitation of the cement mortar inclusion as the mean size increases. The study incorporates bender/extender element tests capturing small-strain constrained moduli, Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio of RCA fractions with different mean grain size and grain size distribution. For the uniform RCA fractions, the results showed that during isotropic compression, the specimens had a clear dependency of their dynamic properties on mean grain size. For the better graded specimens, it was shown that their behavior was dominated to some extend by the finer fraction they were composed rather than being affected equally by the different fractions they consisted of. The results also highlighted the sensitivity of the behavior of the samples to the over-consolidation stress history. For RCA, a multi-composition material, the grain size has a dominant role on the modulus - pressure relationship as well as the sensitivity of material behavior to stress history and these observations must be considered in the analysis of geo-structures where RCA is used as construction material.",2018
Mechanical properties of sea sand recycled aggregate concrete under axial compression,Sea sand recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled coarse aggregate (RCA); Sea sand; Mechanical behavior; Stress-strain curve,DREDGED MARINE SAND; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; DURABILITY; STRENGTH,"The properties of axially loaded sea sand recycled aggregate concrete (SSRAC) were experimentally and theoretically investigated in this paper. The main parameters in the test are the sea sand chloride ions (Cl-) content and the recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) replacement percentage. The influences of sea sand Cl- and RCA content on the compressive strength, stress-strain relation and failure pattern of SSRAC were studied. Test results showed that both the strength and deformation of specimen changed with the variation of sea sand Cl- content and RCA replacement percentage. The compressive strength of SSRAC was higher than that of ordinary concrete. The elastic modulus increased, while the peak strain decreased due to the effect of sea sand. It was also indicated that the influence of recycled coarse aggregate replacement percentage on the properties of SSRAC decreased with increasing sea sand Cl- content. The Poisson's ratio and stress-strain curve of SSRAC were similar to those of ordinary concrete. Finally, a numerical expression for the stress-strain curves of SSRAC under axial loading was presented, which could be used in the theoretical and practical studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Investigation into the properties of concrete modified with biomass combustion fly ash,Biomass combustion fly ash; Concrete; Compressive strength; Porosity; Freeze-thaw resistance,SUGARCANE BAGASSE ASH; WOOD WASTE ASH; CEMENT; REPLACEMENT,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material obtained after the setting of the mix composed of coarse and fine aggregates, cement and water. The main properties of concrete are determined by the quality and characteristics of aggregates, W/C ratio, and the uniformity of mix compaction. Compressive strength is one of the key characteristics of concrete. Materials used: Portland cement CEM 1 42.5 R, 0/4 fraction sand, 4/16 fraction gravel, biomass combustion fly ash, superplasticizer, and water. Seven batches of specimens were made with different biomass fly ash content: 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, and 30% (replacing cement in the mix, %). The following properties of modified concretes were tested: compressive strength, water absorption, density, ultrasonic pulse velocity, porosity (open and closed), and predicted resistance to freezing and thawing cycles. Concrete, where 15% of cement is replaced with biomass combustion fly ash, has higher density (2360 kg/m(3)), compressive strength after 28 days (38.3 MPa), ultrasonic pulse velocity (4466 m/s), lower water absorption rate (3.72%) and higher closed porosity (2.54%). All these characteristics improve the freeze-thaw resistance of concrete. The tests revealed that concrete modified with 15% of biomass fly ash had better durability and freeze-thaw resistance characteristics and can be used in construction works. The obtained linear regression equations illustrate the relationships between the density, compressive strength after 28 days of curing, ultrasonic pulse velocity after 28 days of curing, and predicted freeze-thaw resistance of modified concrete.

Since this mineral compound is highly porous, a better understanding of its surface chemistry, and in particular the reaction with water, is urgently required to understand and avoid corrosion of infrastructure like buildings and bridges. We have gained insight into proton transfer from concrete upon contact with water by applying the so-called Surface Science approach to a well-defined mineral, Wollastonite. Data from IR (infrared) spectroscopy reveal that exposure of this calcium-silicate (CS) substrate to H2O leads to dissociation and the formation of OH-species. This proton transfer is a chemical reaction of key importance, since on the one hand it triggers the conversion of cement into concrete (a calcium-silicate-hydrate phase), but on the other hand also governs the corrosion of concrete. Interestingly, we find that no proton transfer takes place when the same surface is exposed to methanol. In order to understand this unexpected difference, the analysis of the spectroscopic data obtained was aided by a detailed, first-principles computational study employing density functional theory (DFT). The combined experimental and theoretical effort allows derivation of a consistent picture of proton transfer reactions occurring in CS and CSH phases. Implications for strategies to protect this backbone of urban infrastructure from corrosion in harsh, aqueous environments will be discussed.",2018

Effects of steel fiber content and type on dynamic tensile mechanical properties of UHPCC,UHPCC; Steel fiber; Dynamic tensile strength; Spalling; Dynamic increase factor,HIGH-STRAIN RATES; REINFORCED CONCRETE; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; COMPOSITES; FRACTURE; UHPFRC,"Ultra-high performance cementitious composites (UHPCC) has become the most prospective construction materials for both civil and military protective structures. In order to facilitate the structural design and calibration/validation of the constitutive model, the dynamic tensile (spalling) behavior of UHPCC is experimentally studied. By using a 50 mm-diameter conic variable cross-sectional Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB), the dynamic spalling test on Phi 48mm x 400 mm cylindrical UHPCC specimen is conducted. The tensile strain rate ranges from 14.3 s(-1) to 214.8 s(-1), and two typical steel fibers (micro straight and hooked) with three volume fractions of 0%, 1.0% and 2.0% are investigated. The effects of steel fiber content and type as well as the strain rate on the dynamic spalling strength of UHPCC are experimentally assessed. It indicates that the dynamic spalling strength of UHPCC increases obviously with the strain rate rising up to 110 s(-1), and also improves with increasing the content of both two typical steel fibers. When the strain rate increases higher than 60 s(-1), the micro-straight steel fiber has relatively better effect on improving the dynamic spalling strength than the hooked one with the volume fraction of 1.0%. Furthermore, corresponding to each steel fiber content and type, the empirical dynamic increase factors (DIFs) for the dynamic tensile strength of UHPCC are formulated. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

These materials have to exhibit enhanced durability and mechanical performance, and have to incorporate functionalities that satisfy multiple uses in order to be suitable for future emerging structural applications. There is a wide consensus in the research community that concrete, the most used construction material worldwide, has to be engineered at the nanoscale, where its chemical and physiomechanical properties can be truly enhanced. Here, an innovative multifunctional nanoengineered concrete showing an unprecedented range of enhanced properties when compared to standard concrete, is reported. These include an increase of up to 146% in the compressive and 79.5% in the flexural strength, whilst at the same time an enhanced electrical and thermal performance is found. A surprising decrease in water permeability by nearly 400% compared to normal concrete makes this novel composite material ideally suitable for constructions in areas subject to flooding. The unprecedented gamut of functionalities that are reported in this paper are produced by the addition of water-stabilized graphene dispersions, an advancement in the emerging field of nanoengineered concrete which can be readily applied in a more sustainable construction industry.",2018

In the present work, the feasibility of using industrial inorganic polymeric residual wastes as a total (100%) replacement for traditionally used normal concrete materials was examined in the preparation of geopolymer concrete (GPC). In this study's GPC, the cement was replaced totally by fly ash (class F) and ground granular blast furnace slag (GGBFS), the fine aggregates were replaced totally by bottom ash, the coarse aggregates were replaced totally by water-cured fly ash aggregates (WCFAs), which were prepared by using class C fly ash by adopting the pelletisation technique. The GPC mixes were cast with WCFAs at 0, 10, 20 and 30% replacement of fly ash (class F) by GGBFS with different molar ratios of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solutions (8, 10, 12 M). The concrete was cured at ambient temperature only to minimise the water during water curing. The physical and mechanical properties of the GPC were studied by using the combination of all the mentioned materials.

Optimization of Fly-Ash Dosage for the Stabilization of Gravel Soil Using Cement for Use as Flexible Pavement Material,Fly-Ash; Cement; Sub-Base; Stabilization; California Bearing Ration; Unconfined Compressive Strength,CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE,"Civil engineering infrastructures such as road embankements located on soft soil material are prone to deformation. Load bearing capacity of a sub-grade can thus, be improved to support pavements and foundations. In this regard, the study aimed at investigating the influence of a simultaneuos use of a sustainable construction material (Fly-ash class F) and filler on bearing capacity as well as unconfined compressive strength of the sub-base soil respectively. The fly-ash was employed as a replacemnt of filler in the stabilization of gravel soil with cement. The filler was repalced with fly-ash at the rate of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20% while keeping the proportion of cement constant at 5% and this mix ratio was designated as group 1. On the other hand, fly-ash content was kept at a constant dosage of 15% while varying the cement content at the rate of 5%, 7.5%, 10% and 12% of cement by weight of filler material, likewise, this mix ratio was designated as group 2. Compaction test, California bearing ratio (CBR) tests and Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were performed on the gravel soil treated with the different dosages of fly ash. The study reveals that 15% of Fly-ash was the optimum dose in groups 1 and 2, necessary to achieve maximum values of unconfined compressive strengths and califonia bearing ratio. The optimum mix ratio necessary to achieve the maximum value of UCS of 2.118 kg/cm(2) and maximum CBR of 85% for both groups was found to be 15% fly-ash content and 5% dose of cement.",2018
Stabilizing Asphalt Concrete Using Kenaf Fibers,Asphalt Concrete; Natural; Kenaf Fibers; Stability; Resilient Modulus,,"Hot climate countries like Malaysia face problems of excessive rutting and cracking in flexible pavements with bituminous wearing course. The application of natural fibers in construction industry has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years due to lightweight, low-cost, non-toxic and ecofriendly properties. Natural fibers like kenaf; one of the industrial crops commercially grown in Malaysia is being used for different applications. The outer layer of plant stems of mostly H. cannibusL. from genus Hibiscus and family Malvaceae, generally known as Kenaf, can be used as automotive and construction material in the field of engineering. It has great potential to use as automotive and as construction material in engineering fields. This study attempted to stabilize asphalt concrete by using kenaf fibers. The characteristics of asphalt concrete with kenaf fibers have been shown through this study. Laboratory results proved that by increasing the percentage of fibers from 0.1% to 0.3% the stability is increased to 3.8% to 11% respectively. The porosity and other physical features of kenaf fibers can be credited to the higher resilient modulus of mixes at 25 degrees C and 40 degrees C.

Achieving Sustainability of Traditional Wooden Houses in Indonesia by Utilization of Cost-Efficient Waste-Wood Composite,waste-wood composite; yield strength; failure mode; cost efficient; sustainable,TIMBER; NAIL; HARDWOOD; STRENGTH; SCREW,"Although Indonesians have for many years used wood to build traditional houses, currently it is difficult to find new traditional houses made from wood. Since wood is too expensive for local people, concrete becomes the major construction material instead. However, wood is considered a sustainable material that is eco-friendly, recyclable, and has less of an environmental impact than concrete. In this study, an innovative and cost efficient waste-wood composite structure was proposed with the intention of fulfilling local demand for the construction of traditional wooden houses, as well as supplying a sustainable and cost-efficient wooden product in the construction sector. Four small pieces of waste wood connected with steel nails or self-tapping screws were assembled into a rectangular waste-wood composite, serving as secondary beam, column, or brace. These waste-wood composites are considered recyclable and low-cost, and provide an alternative solution for local people that achieves an affordable and sustainable construction system. The assembled wood components were tested under single shear in order to clarify the structural performance of connection and the failure modes. The comparison of the experimental results and predicted results showed that the predicted strength is considered in a conservative manner for further application. In addition, the cost estimation and comparison between a solid wood structure and the waste-wood composite structure indicated that the price of the waste-wood composite structure is potentially competitive and cost-efficient for the local people, which was optimistic for future development.",2018
Characterization of particle emissions from cutting of carbon fiber reinforced concrete (Carbon concrete composite),,EXPOSURE,"Carbon concrete is a newly developed concrete composite construction material. The reinforcement of carbon concrete, in contrast to conventional reinforced concrete, is made of carbon fiber material in the form of bonded rovings as a structured layer. Upon cutting carbon concrete, the released fine dust contains components of the fiber material. In order to investigate the health relevance of these emissions, an analytical system was developed that combines a cell culture exposure system with a cutting dust generator and an aerosol generator producing reference aerosols. Furthermore, the system is equipped with a particle size spectrometer and a mass spectrometer to characterize the particle and gas phase of the released aerosols. First results for current carbon concrete configurations show that the generated dust exhibits relevant concentrations of particles in the alveolar and thoracic size fraction leading to corresponding adverse effects in exposed cells. However, in these data no significant difference between dust from the cutting of unreinforced concrete and carbon concrete can be identified. In particular, the analysis of the released fibers did not reveal any health-relevant fiber dimensions concerning the WHO recommendation.",2018

This is due to its good properties as a construction material and the availability of its components. Nevertheless, the present worldwide construction increases and the high-energy consumption for cement production means a high environmental impact. On the other hand, one of the main problems in the iron and steel industry is waste generation and byproducts that must be properly processed or reused to promote environmental sustainability. One of these byproducts is steel slag. The cement substitution with slag strategy achieves two goals: raw materials consumption reduction and waste management. In the present work, four different concrete mixtures are evaluated. The 25% cement substitution is carried out with different types of slag. Tests were made to evaluate the advantages and drawbacks of each mixture. Depending on the origin, characteristics, and treatment of the slag, the concrete properties changed. Certain mixtures provided proper concrete properties. Stainless steel slag produced a fluent mortar that reduced water consumption with a slight mechanical strength loss. Mixtures with ground granulated blast furnace slag properties are better than the reference concrete (without slag).",2018

Permeability indices and corrosion resistance of geopolymer and Portland cement concretes,cement; cementitious; materialsdurability-related properties; sustainability,ASH; PERFORMANCE; ATTACK,"Along with the strength and durability of construction materials, the environmental aspects of using these materials have to be taken into consideration. Geopolymer concrete is a new generation of 'green' concrete, mainly made from waste materials and aluminosilicate binder. The main objective of this work was to study the permeability indices such as water penetration depth, water absorption and voids ratio as well as the corrosion resistance of geopolymer concrete. The parameters considered were the molarity of the alkaline activator (sodium hydroxide), the alkaline solution binder ratio, the binder material content, curing temperature, cement addition and silica fume addition. The performances of geopolymer concrete and hydraulic Portland cement concrete were also compared. From the test results, in terms of the permeability indices, the optimum parameter values were found to be a molarity of 16, an alkaline activator to binder ratio of 0.40, binder materials content of 450 kg/m(3) and a curing temperature of 70 degrees C for 48 h duration. The addition of cement or silica fume was found to improve the performance of the geopolymer concrete.

The main objective of this study is to develop new and effective construction materials for strengthening of deficient RC beams. The experimental part of the study is divided into three stages. The first stage involved testing of thirteen shear deficient beams under four-point loading as control beams taking into account the effect of shear span-to-effective depth ratio (a/d = 1.2, 2.2, and 3.0) and amount of longitudinal reinforcement (rho = 1.29%, 1.76%, and 2.28%). The second stage involved four shear deficient beams strengthened with SIFCON. For purpose of comparison, two of the tested control beams with a/d of 2.2 and. of 1.76% and 2.28% were repaired with SIFCON jacket. The test results indicate that all the beams strengthened with SIFCON jackets displayed an excellent shear capacity. The use of SIFCON jackets as external shear reinforcement eliminated the brittle shear failure and increased the ultimate shear strength of strengthened beams from 37 to 53%. Therefore, SIFCON jacket can be considered as a promising material for strengthening and repairing of RC structures. Finally, an analytical model was proposed for predicting the shear behavior of the strengthened RC beams with SIFCON Jackets with an acceptable error of less than 30%.",2018
Transient moisture profiles in cover-zone concrete during water absorption,Concrete; Water-absorption; Monitoring; Conductivity; Moisture profiles; Boltzmann transform,POROUS MATERIALS; FLOW; RADIOGRAPHY; TRANSPORT,"A number of sophisticated techniques, such as NMR imaging and gamma-ray attenuation, have now been used to study moisture transport in porous construction materials. This paper presents initial developments in the application of discretized, electrical conductivity measurements as a relatively simple technique to monitor water movement within cover-zone concrete. Using a 3-phase model and the Archie relationship for porous rock formations, conductivity measurements are used to evaluate moisture-content profiles during water ingress and, through the use of Boltzmann's transformation, it is shown that these profiles collapse onto a master-curve. Having obtained the master-curve during absorption, the capillary transport coefficient (De) can then be obtained; however, the current work focuses on presenting the methodology as an alternative testing technique.",2018
Heat resistance of portland cements,Portland cement; Fire resistance; Grinding fineness; Oxide composition,HIGH-TEMPERATURES; FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; PASTES; PFA,"Recent fire cases indicated again the importance of fire research. Fast development of construction technology requires new materials. Initiation and development of fire are strongly influenced by the choice of construction materials. In addition to their mechanical properties, their behaviour in elevated temperature is also of high importance. Residual compressive strength of concrete exposed to high temperatures is influenced by the following factors: water-to-cement ratio, cement-to-aggregate ratio, type of aggregate and water content of concrete before exposing it to high temperatures and the fire process. Therefore, mix design and composition of concrete are of high importance for high temperatures. Based on the literature, the fire resistance of concrete is influenced by the used cement type. As regards the cement type, considerable importance has been attached to the various auxiliary materials, such as slag, fly ash, trass, metakaolines and silica fume. There has been no special research devoted to the fire behaviour of pure portland cements. Pure portland cements can be made with various oxide compositions or with different grinding fineness, which increases the resistance of cements to fire. The question arises what effects grinding fineness and oxide composition have on fire resistance of cements. In my experiments, the resistance of portland cements of different composition and grinding fineness to fire (high temperature) were examined. For the test of the solidified cement paste, cement paste cubes of 30-mm edge length were prepared. The specimens were stored in water for 7 days and then in laboratory conditions for 21 days. The cubes of more than 28 days were heated to the given temperature in the furnace and then kept at the given temperature for 2 h (50, 150, 300, 500, 800 A degrees C). Following the 2 h of thermal load, the specimens were examined once their temperature cooled down to room temperature. I have experimentally demonstrated that in case of portland cements, the grinding fineness and aluminate modulus of the cement (i.e. the oxide composition of the cement) have a significant effect on its fire resistance.",2018
Hybrid Composite Beam Bridge Superstructure Design Considerations for Thermal Gradient,Hybrid composite beam (HCB); Thermal design; Thermostructural analysis; Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites; Finite-element modeling; Bridges; Temperature effects,ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; CONCRETE,"The hybrid composite beam (HCB) is an innovative idea that incorporates traditional construction materials (i.e.,steel and concrete) with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in an efficient configuration to optimize the beam constituents' performance. The HCB is comprised of three main subcomponents: a composite shell, a compression reinforcement, and a tension reinforcement. The shell is comprised of a glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) box. The compression reinforcement consists of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) that is pumped into a profiled conduit within the shell. The tension reinforcement consists of galvanized-steel tendons anchored at the compression reinforcement ends. The HCB is a promising technology in bridge applications because it has several advantages over the conventional structural members (e.g.,a prolonged lifetime and a lighter weight). This new technology was recently used to construct three bridges in Missouri. This research study performs the first investigation and analysis for an in-service HCB bridge superstructure's behavior subjected to thermal loads and proposes a thermal design methodology. This investigation is crucial because the thermal stresses, if not accounted for during the design, can significantly affect a bridge superstructure's durability, which this new HCB technology strives to address. Beam elements from the longest-spanning HCB constructed bridge in Missouri were instrumented with various strain gauges and thermocouples. The constituting elements' temperatures and the corresponding induced strains were recorded over 6 months. The proposed algorithm was used to predict the induced strains. A two-step thermostructural finite-element analysis (FEA) was performed to analyze the HCB's thermal behavior and further evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance. The results of this study showed that the proposed algorithm was able to predict, with acceptable accuracy, the thermal stresses and strains in a HCB bridge superstructure. Subsequently, this algorithm is recommended as a useful tool for designing and analyzing HCB bridges that are undergoing environmental thermal effects. The current study also presents recommendations for modifying the thermal gradients recommended by AASHTO for the thermal design of reinforced concrete (RC) superstructures to better suit HCB bridges. Finally, the study proposed techniques for increasing the stiffness of a HCB bridge superstructure, while at the same time minimizing the induced thermal stresses under temperature fluctuations.",2018
Realisation of enhanced self-compacting geopolymer concrete using spent garnet as sand replacement,aggregates; alkali-silica reaction; sustainability,MAGNETOPHOTONIC CRYSTALS; FLY-ASH; PERFORMANCE,"Garnets are a waste spin-off of surface treatment operations and thus remain a major environmental concern worldwide. The robust engineering properties of these waste garnets offer the opportunity to obtain efficient construction materials by way of their appropriate recycling. In this spirit, the authors evaluate the capacity of spent garnets as sand replacement for achieving self-compacting geopolymer concrete (SCGPC). Such SCGPC specimens are prepared using ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) wherein the river sand is replaced by spent garnet at varying contents (0 to 100%) under constant liquid/binder (L/B) mass ratio of 0.4. Performance evaluations of the developed SCGPC samples are made using several tests, including durability, workability and flexural, compressive and splitting tensile strength conforming to the Efnarc standard. Test results reveal an enhancement in the workability of the proposed SCGPC specimen with the increase of spent garnet contents. Furthermore, other strengths are discerned to be lower compared to the control sample at all stages of replacement. It is established that the spent garnet is a prospective candidate for sand replacement up to 25% in terms of environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness and conservation of natural resources.",2018

One of these materials is lime-hemp concrete, a self-bearing bio-based insulation material with low thermal conductivity and good CO2 uptake but with weak mechanical properties. In this study alternative magnesium binders are proposed to substitute the traditionally used lime binder in hemp concrete, comparing the environmental impact of these binder composites. To make the comparison, experimental mixtures with both traditionally used and alternative binder composites were produced and their mechanical and thermal properties tested. The magnesium binders showed promising results as these composites were approximately two times stronger, having similar density and thermal conductivity. Afterwards the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to evaluate and compare the environmental impact of all tested composites. Lime based binder composites achieved negative CO2 emissions, varying from -46.5 to -68.6 kg CO2/m(3). Alternative binder, magnesium phosphate cement, demonstrated significantly greater environmental impact than all other binders due to its hardener, potassium phosphate, which is highly energy and resource intensive. Magnesium oxychloride cement showed promising results with bio-based filler, as their combined environmental impact was lower in most categories compared to lime-hemp concrete, and negative CO2 emissions of -37.38 kg CO2/m(3) were achieved. These negative CO2 emissions were achieved with biogenic CO2 uptake from hemp growth and low binder content, thus achieving low thermal conductivity of 0.062 W/m(2)*K at 214 kg/m(3) density.",2018

The replacement percentages are 5%, 10%, and 15%. The mixtures are pressurized into pellets and sintered at 1050-1130 degrees C/1150 degrees C for 10 min. Heavy metal leaching from the sintered pellets is dramatically reduced as compared to raw materials. Leaching results of toxic metals, including Cd, Se, Cr, Pb, As, Ag, Cu, and Ba, well meet government's environmental legal limits. An increase in sintering temperature from 1000 degrees C to 1130 degrees C/1150 degrees C always reduces the leaching level. Sintered at >= 1050 degrees C, all pellet particle densities, except the one not containing oyster shell sintered at 1050 degrees C, meet the practical particle density requirement as lightweight aggregate, <1.6 g/cm(3), for construction sector. Oyster shell amendment generally results in lower particle density with the 5% amendment resulting in the least particle density. Over-replacement of steel fly ash with oyster shell leads to an increase in particle density due to partial melting. Moreover, 24-h water sorption rate of all lightweight aggregates also meets the requirement abided by practical construction sector, <18-20%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018

The results of both foaming agents in zeolite-based geopolymers met Ecuadorian technical standards NTE INEN 643 and NTE INEN 638; nevertheless, the use of aluminum powder as foaming agent exhibited a better pore size distribution, suggesting a better performance. On the basis of these results, foamed geopolymers are suitable construction materials for the application of manufactured for masonry wall in houses. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanical performance of steel fibre reinforced rubberised concrete for flexible concrete pavements,Recycled fibres; Rubberised concrete; Steel fibre concrete; Rubberised steel fibre concrete; Hybrid reinforcement; Flexible concrete; Flexible pavements,CEMENT-BASED MORTARS; CRUMB RUBBER; TIRE-RUBBER; WASTE TIRES; AGGREGATE; BEHAVIOR; RESISTANCE; PARTICLES; CRACKING; BLOCK,"This work aims to develop materials for flexible concrete pavements as an alternative to asphalt concrete or polymer-bound rubber surfaces and presents a study on steel fibre reinforced rubberised concrete (SFRRuC). The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of steel fibres (manufactured and/or recycled fibres) on the fresh and mechanical properties of rubberised concrete (RuC) comprising waste tyre rubber (WTR). Free shrinkage is also examined. The main parameters investigated through ten different mixes are WTR and fibre contents. The results show that the addition of fibres in RuC mixes with WTR replacement substantially mitigates the loss in flexural strength due to the rubber content (from 50% to 9.6% loss, compared to conventional concrete). The use of fibres in RuC can also enable the development of sufficient flexural strength and enhance strain capacity and post-peak energy absorption behaviour, thus making SFRRuC an ideal alternative construction material for flexible pavements.

Assessing the potential of functionally graded concrete using fibre reinforced and recycled aggregate concrete,Functionally graded concrete; Fibre reinforced concrete; Recycled aggregate concrete; Sustainability; Feasibility,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; BEHAVIOR; STEEL; ORIENTATION; FRC,"Despite ordinary Portland cement concrete presenting low performance in tension and a negative impact on the natural environment, it is the most used construction material. Researchers have noted that the usage of fibres as reinforcement and recycled aggregates, instead of natural ones, may minimize these issues. The concept of functionally graded material for new composite materials is proposed to address these problems. In this paper, five different concrete mixes were produced to analyse the potential of using functionally graded concretes (FGC) for sustainable structures. Their mechanical performance, a sustainable quality control method for these materials and their costs and embodied CO2 were analyzed. The results show that FGC, even though showing a post-cracking flexural performance lower than conventional FRC, possesses high potential in terms of structural design based on Model Code 2010 specifications. The equations provided to use the Barcelona test to control the material, which is more environmentally friendly than the standardized beam test, may facilitate the introduction of FCC in the construction market. Finally, considering costs and embodied CO2, FCC presents a good prospect to be used as structural material for future sustainable concrete elements. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Use of hollow glass microspheres and hybrid fibres to improve the mechanical properties of engineered cementitious composite,Engineered cementitious composite; Hollow glass microsphere; Ductility; Strain-hardening; Energy absorption,STRAIN-HARDENING BEHAVIOR; REINFORCED CONCRETE; PROJECTILE IMPACT; PVA-ECC; RESISTANCE,"Engineered cementitious composite (ECC) is a well-known high performance cementitious composites for its superior strain-hardening properties and high impact resistance. ECC has been produced using single type of fibre (mono-fibre). However, producing ECC using hybrid-fibre and as a lightweight construction material is in need for investigation. This paper describes the mechanical properties of ECC containing hollow glass microspheres (HGM) and hybrid-fibre consisted of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibre and steel fibre (SF). The variables in this study were the HGM content (0% and 10%) and the hybrid-fibre volume fraction proportions (PVA : SF of 2.0% : 0.0%, 1.75% : 0.25%, 1.50% : 0.50%, and 1.25% : 0.75%). Compressive strength, flexural behaviour, energy absorption including first crack energy absorption were measured for the proposed cementitious composites. This study aimed at developing a new class of ECC with less unit weight, high-energy dissipation and ductility compared to conventional ECC. The results showed that mono-fibre ECC (PVA : SF is 2.0% : 0.0%) had higher compressive and flexural strengths than those showed by hybrid-fibre ECC mixtures. The ratio (PVA/SF) of 3.0 displayed the highest flexural strength compared to other hybrid-fibre ECC. The compressive and flexural strength of ECC was found to decrease with using HGM, although some lightweight ECC matrixes were deemed viable. Enhancements in compressive and flexural strength with further decrease in unit weight were achieved while w/b ratio decreased from 0.56 to 0.45. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Determination of thermal damage in rock specimen using intelligent techniques,Thermal damage; Sandstone; Multivariate regression analysis; Artificial neural network; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system,UNDERGROUND COAL-GASIFICATION; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; HIGH-TEMPERATURES; TENSILE-STRENGTH; BRITTLE ROCK; STRAIN-RATE; SANDSTONE; GRANITE; CONCRETE,"Studies conducted by several researchers suggest that a large variance exists in the morphological integrity of rocks when subjected to thermal treatment. The extent of thermal damage, D(T), can be quantified by analyzing the change in either the elastic modulus, ultrasonic wave velocities or the acoustic emission signals. However, these require the use of sophisticated laboratory equipment, which may not be readily available. Additionally, the shape and size of the sample has to adhere to the specifications that have been mandated for the corresponding experiments. This would further introduce delay in the process of assessing the damage. Therefore, in this study, new predictive models have been developed, which can predict the extent of damage (D(T)) from the physical properties of thermally-modified fine-grained Dholpur sandstone. The sandstone is a primary construction material, and has been widely used in several Indian monuments of historic and political importance. The models have been developed using statistical and soft-computing tools such as multivariate regression analysis (MVRA), artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The physical properties viz. temperature (T), density (D), porosity (P), thermal expansion coefficients (E-L and E-v) and ultrasonic wave velocities (V-P and V-S), serve as predictor variables. The efficacy of the models has been tested by calculating the performance indices, namely, coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and variance account for (VAF). The results suggest that the ANFIS model has the best prediction capacity.",2018
An innovative apparatus for simulating daily temperature for investigating thermal performance of wallboards incorporating PCMs,Daily temperature simulator; Phase change material; Concrete wallboard; Thermal energy storage,PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; ENERGY-STORAGE; BUILDING APPLICATIONS; GYPSUM; COMPOSITES,"In recent years, many researchers have been attracted to the application of phase change materials (PCMs) in the production of construction materials. PCMs are substances with large latent heat capacity and their combination with building materials such as concrete and gypsum would lead to an enhancement in their thermal characteristics, mostly thermal inertia and also the capacity of storing thermal energy. One of the problems associated with the use of PCMs is the correspondence of their melting temperature range with the temperature of the ambient in which they will be used. This paper is aimed to introduce an innovative apparatus for investigating some characteristics of PCM-containing wallboards such as the amount of the reduction of maximum indoor temperature, the time delay to reach the maximum indoor temperature, and the cycling stability of PCMs in melting and freezing cycles. The compatibility of the melting temperature of the PCMs with the ambient temperature to ensure the charge/discharge process of PCMs can be studied as well. The analysis of the test results carried out by this apparatus will help the researchers to a better understanding of the thermal behavior of any kind of PCMs in many different environments. In this study, thermal performance of a precast concrete sandwich panel incorporating PEG 600 as PCM is evaluated using the introduced apparatus. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2018
Synergism between palm oil fuel ash and slag: Production of environmental-friendly alkali activated mortars with enhanced properties,Alkali activated mortar; POFA; GBFS; Alkaline solution; Envirmental-friendly mortar,GEOPOLYMER MORTAR; FLY-ASH; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; CONCRETE; PERFORMANCE,"Environmental concern raised by the production of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), is behind the search for greener construction materials and remediation. One such material is alkali activated mortars (AAMs). It is well known that the high molarity of sodium hydroxide (12-16 M) and high content of sodium silicate (sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide higher than 2.5) have negative impacts on the environment. Driven by this idea, we prepared some binary alkali activated mortars by combining palm oil fuel ash (POFA) and ground blast furnace slag (GBFS) at varying ratios. The effect of low concentration alkaline solution on the fresh, mechanical and durable properties of alkali activated was determined. The ratio of sodium hydroxide (molarity 4 M) (NH) to sodium silicate (NS) in the mixture was kept at 0.75. Microstructures of the prepared alkali activated mortars were analyzed using SEM, XRD and FTIR measurements. The achieved high strength (approximate to 72 MPa at age of 28 days) of the alkali activated mortars was attributed to the synergy between GBFS and POFA. Partial replacement of GBFS with POFA was demonstrated to be beneficial for improving the compressive strength, durability and resistance against sulphuric acid attack. Meanwhile, calcium aluminium silicate hydrate (CASH) gel was discerned to be the main reaction product of POFA and GBFS in these binary systems. It was established that the proposed AAMs can contribute towards the development of sustainable materials. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018

The integration of BIM and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has potential to reduce the time for life cycle inventory, and at the same time, substantially improve the representativeness of the LCA results for the specific building design. The latter merit is not trivial. For instance, due to time limit, most building LCA studies estimate the building materials and fuels consumed in construction phase quite roughly, which excludes the choices on a wide range of construction techniques, materials, specialties and machines, no need to mention the energy consumption in operation phase, which is usually estimated in an even bolder manner. The roughness of the LCA practice undermines its credibility and hinders its application as a decision supporting tool for low carbon design. Currently, China's Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector is undergoing a smart transformation, steered by the increased use of BIM. This paper presents a BIM-enabled LCA method and illustrates how the method can be used to facilitate the low carbon design under the circumstance of the smart AEC transition in China. A case study on carbon footprint accounting for a residential building is conducted. In this study, various software tools and data sources are combined to enhance the data flow and interoperability between BIM models and LCA models. BIM tools are used to create the BIM model, calculate the inputs (materials, construction machines, energies, water and so on) of on-site construction process and simulate the energy consumption of building operation. The eBalance, a China's local LCA software tool is applied to build the LCA model. The Chinese Life Cycle Database is used as the main data source (72.73%) to calculate the carbon footprint of the given building while the Ecoinvent database and European Life Cycle Database act as supplementary. The results show that the carbon footprint of the building is 2993 kg CO(2)eq/m(2). The operation phase contributes to 69% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, while the building material production contributes to 24%. Concrete is the most used building material, which accounts for 82% of mass but contributes to only 44% of the material related GHG emission. Although steel and aluminum account for only 2.6% and 1.4% of mass, they contribute to 28% and 17% GHG emission, respectively. Through BIM-enable LCA modeling, the potential life cycle environmental performance of the buildings can be assessed in detail. This makes the LCA not only more accessible but also more credible for the AEC professionals to use it as a guide for the low carbon design of buildings. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This research aims to solidify the heavy metals in MSWI fly ash and make it to be utilizable construction materials under the guidance of intermediate-calcium cementitious materials (ICCM), and meanwhile figure out the solidification and hydration mechanism. The hydration characteristics of ICCM were characterized by XRD, FTIR, Si-29 MAS-NMR and SEM techniques, and the environmental properties are investigated by TCLP and EPMA. The results indicate that the optimal ratio of (CaO + MgO)/(SiO2 + Al2O3) for ICCM is at the range of 0.76-0.88. The compressive strengths of ICCM reach the 42.5R normal Portland cement level, and the leaching concentrations of heavy metals meet the Chinese integrated wastewater discharge standard GB 8978-1996. As predominant hydration products, ettringite, hydrocalumite and amorphous C-S-H gel are principally responsible for the strength development of ICCM, and the (Ca + Mg)/(Si + Al) ratio at 0.88 has the best polymerized structure. The heavy metals are well solidified through combining with the C-S-H gel or absorbed in the hydration pastes. This paper provides an effective solution to use the MSWI fly ash in building material.

Nanoscale origins of creep in calcium silicate hydrates,,C-S-H; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CONCRETE CREEP; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ENERGY LANDSCAPE; CEMENT; RELAXATION; MODEL; SHRINKAGE,"The time-dependent response of structural materials dominates our aging infrastructure's life expectancy and has important resilience implications. For calcium-silicate-hydrates, the glue of cement, nanoscale mechanisms underlying time-dependent phenomena are complex and remain poorly understood. This complexity originates in part from the inherent difficulty in studying nanoscale longtime phenomena in atomistic simulations. Herein, we propose a three-staged incremental stress-marching technique to overcome such limitations. The first stage unravels a stretched exponential relaxation, which is ubiquitous in glassy systems. When fully relaxed, the material behaves viscoelastically upon further loading, which is described by the standard solid model. By progressively increasing the interlayer water, the time-dependent response of calcium-silicate-hydrates exhibits a transition from viscoelastic to logarithmic creep. These findings bridge the gap between atomistic simulations and nanomechanical experimental measurements and pave the way for the design of reduced aging construction materials and other disordered systems such as metallic and oxide glasses.",2018
A Feasibility Study on Timber Damage Detection Using Piezoceramic-Transducer-Enabled Active Sensing,timber damage detection; piezoelectric transducer; active sensing approach; wavelet-packet-based damage index,DYNAMIC SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; FLEXURAL VIBRATION WAVE; STRUCTURAL HEALTH; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; MODAL-ANALYSIS; BEAM; WOOD; PROPAGATION; PERFORMANCE; VALIDATION,"In recent years, piezoelectric-based transducers and technologies have made significant progress towards structural health monitoring and damage evaluation for various metal and concrete structures. Timber is still commonly used as a construction material in practical engineering; however, there is a lack of research on the health monitoring of timber-based structures using piezoelectric-based transducers and methods. This paper conducts a feasibility study on timber damage detection using surface-mounted piezoelectric patches, which enable the stress-wave-based active sensing approach. Typical damage modes in timber frame structures, such as surface cracks and holes, were investigated in this study. In the active sensing approach, one piezoceramic transducer is used as an actuator to generate stress waves, which propagate along the surface of the timber structure, and other piezoceramic transducers function as sensors to detect the propagating stress waves. Defects, such as a crack or a hole, induce additional attenuation to the propagating stress wave. Based on this attenuation, the proposed method can detect the defects using the wavelet-packet-based damage index, demonstrating its implementation potential for real-time timber damage detection.",2018
Use of Zeolitized Coal Fly Ash as Main Component in Panels with High Fire Resistance,fire resistance; leaching; mechanical strength; radiological properties; zeolitized fly ashes,CONCRETE; WASTE; PLANT,"In the present work, coal fly ashes from a Spanish coal-fired power plant were used to synthesize zeolite using an alkaline treatment. The feasibility of making highly fire-insulated panels using these zeolitized fly ashes was examined. The panels were prepared using zeolitized fly ashes as the main component (50, 60, and 70% by weight) combined with gypsum, silica fume (4.5% by weight, constant), and glass fiber (9.5% by weight, constant). The manufactured panels had great water retention capacity and, consequently, showed up to 30% greater insulating properties compared to commercial gypsum panels. It was found that compression and bending strengths diminished as the proportion of zeolitized fly ashes increased, and the panels did not present any leachability of heavy metals or radiological problems. The panels developed with zeolitized fly ashes could potentially be useful as a component in construction materials for passive fire protection in doors and firewalls in buildings and industrial installations.",2018

The trend in Central Europe we witness nowadays is that people are going back from the impersonal and restrictive conditions of tower blocks to the more natural and relaxed conditions of family houses. New approaches to urbanization in the context of the sustainability of cities can be characterized by their use of innovative technologies and energetically efficient and ecologically acceptable construction materials. Companies have substantially responded to this trend, meeting the demand by offering a wide range of solutions. Alongside the traditional and long-established construction materials (brick, concrete), including wood, companies are introducing modern, innovative, and viable construction alternatives. Modern methods of construction (MMC), to which modern houses based on wood belong, promote the idea and application of environmentally and energetically efficient constructions. Just as the construction process itself significantly contributes to the depletion of natural resources, the production of construction materials contributes to significant environmental pollution and greenhouse emissions (particularly CO2). Sustainability assessments of construction projects increasingly involve the use of methodologies which assess sustainability criteria throughout a product's Life-cycle. For our analysis of suburban housing clusters designed to serve as family houses, we chose an actual family house construction completed using a modern construction system based on wood. For the sake of comparing the modern construction method, we created an alternative model of a construction based on a traditional masonry construction system. The main objective of this contribution is to analyze selected variants of constructions in terms of environmental and economic sustainability characteristics, as part of a broader assessment of permanent sustainability, by applying the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle cost (LCC) methodologies within specified assessment boundaries. A partial objective of this contribution is to point towards the ways of applying the LCA and LCC assessment methodologies, such as in the decision-making processes involved in alternative investment strategies for the construction of urban clusters in the context of sustainability.",2018
Application of Recycled Ceramic Aggregates for the Production of Mineral-Asphalt Mixtures,mineral-asphalt mixtures; aggregate from sanitary ceramic wastes; environmentally friendly construction materials,LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CONCRETE; WASTE; MICROSTRUCTURE; STRENGTH; INDUSTRY; CLAY,"This paper describes a method of designing and producing innovative mineral-asphalt mixtures, which utilize waste aggregate from the recycling of sanitary ceramics. The work presents the basic properties of the ceramic material, the investigation concerning the microstructure of the aggregate obtained from the grinding of waste, and a comparison with the images obtained for the aggregates usually employed in mineral-asphalt mixtures. The mixtures were designed for the application in the wearing course. Four series of mixtures were prepared. In the first and second, the ceramic aggregate constituted a partial substitute for dolomite, whereas in the third, we substituted granodiorite, and the fourth series contained only dolomite. The mixtures were examined for the content of soluble binder, the bulk density of samples, the presence of voids, the space filled with binder, and the susceptibility to water and frost corrosion. The obtained results were compared with the standard requirements. The microstructure as well as the contact zone in the considered mineral-asphalt mixtures are presented based on research conducted by means of a scanning electron microscope (SEM).",2018
Prediction of aggregate modified index (AMI) using geomechanical properties of limestones,Hamedan limestone; Petrographical property; Geomechanical property; Aggregate modified index (AMI); Simple regression; Multiple regression,STRENGTH; CONCRETE; ROCKS,"Limestone aggregates are considered as construction materials with special suitability for use as a part of base courses, asphalt and Portland cement concrete. The suitability of aggregates for different applications is determined by aggregate parameters including the Los Angeles aggregate abrasion value (LAAV), aggregate impact value (AIV), and aggregate crushing value (ACV). In this paper, a combination of all these parameters is presented as an aggregate index (AI); Hamedan Limestones were classified based on this new index. The physico-mechanical properties of aggregates can also be used to evaluate their suitability for any specific engineering application; therefore, these properties of rock samples were measured. The AI was modified using p-wave velocity parameters, and changed into an aggregate modified index (AI/V-p = AMI). Statistical analyses, including simple and multiple regressions, were applied to offer some rational approaches and identify those physico-mechanical parameters that are more appropriate for prediction of AMI. Consequently, based on these analyses, p-wave velocity, uniaxial compressive strength, dry density and Brazilian tensile strength parameters show significant correlations with AMI at alpha-level = 0.1.",2018

Due to its relatively low tensile resistance, concrete tends to experience tensile failure and cracking under external loads. To enhance the tensile performance and ductility of concrete material, possible solutions including fibre reinforcement and steel mesh reinforcement are investigated in the present study. Steel fibre, ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibre and steel wire meshes were mixed with varying volume fraction in the concrete matrix. Static material tests including uniaxial compression and flexural bending tests showed that the steel fibre addition yielded better strength enhancement while UHMWPE fibre provided better material ductility. Concrete samples with hybrid steel fibre-steel mesh reinforcement showed high strength and ductility. Field blast tests are designed to study the behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs under close-in detonations. Different damage profiles are observed from the blast tests. The advantages and disadvantages of using different reinforcing materials are discussed. From the results, the advantages of replacing steel fibre with UHMWPE fibre or steel wire mesh were demonstrated.",2018

However, the high cost of the constituents limits the wide application of SHCCs. To reduce the material cost and improve the sustainability, this study explores the potential of replacing commonly-used polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers by recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers. The potential of fiber hybridization was first evaluated using micromechanical modeling, and the ultimate tensile strain of hybrid-fiber SHCCs was estimated using a semi-empirical method. Then the tensile performance of SHCCs after standard curing and accelerated aging was experimentally evaluated, and the crack pattern development with increasing tensile strain was recorded. Satisfactory mechanical performance can be achieved even when 50% of PVA fibers are replaced by recycled PET fibers with surface treatment. In addition, using recycled PET fibers in SHCCs can significantly reduce the material cost and environmental impact.",2018

The proposed system relies on the fact that the presence of water leads to an increase of the dielectric permittivity of materials; therefore, from TDR-based permittivity measurements, it is possible to infer the water content value. In practical applications, the proposed system could be used for assessing the intrinsic water content of construction materials before they are poured into the concrete mixture. Knowing the intrinsic water content of the raw materials, in fact, would allow to evaluate the optimal amount of water that should be added to the mixture in order to achieve the desired waterto- cement ratio. This, in turn, would permit to fine-tune and control the mechanical properties of the final concrete structures. For assessing the feasibility of using the proposed system for the intended purpose, water content measurements were carried out on three construction materials, namely, sand, gray cement, and white portland cement. For each of these materials, a calibration curve relating water content to the apparent dielectric permittivity was derived; additionally, through repeated measurements, also a confidence interval was associated with the calibration curves.",2018

This review aims to summarize the key research progress acquired during the last decade regarding the understanding of MICC reaction mechanisms and the development of durable materials from an interdisciplinary perspective. Special focus was laid on aspects governing concrete micoorganisms interaction since being the central process steering biogenic acid corrosion. The insufficient knowledge regarding the latter is proposed as a central reason for insufficient progress in tailored material development for aggressive wastewater systems. To date no cement-based material exists, suitable to withstand the aggressive conditions related to MICC over its entire service life. Research is in particular needed on the impact of physiochemical material parameters on microbial community structure, growth characteristics and limitations within individual concrete speciation. Herein an. interdisciplinary approach is presented by combining results from material sciences, microbiology, mineralogy and hydrochemistry to stimulate the development of novel and sustainable materials and mitigation strategies for MICC. For instance, the application of antibacteriostatic agents is introduced as an effective instrument to limit microbial growth on concrete surfaces in aggressive sewer environments. Additionally, geopolymer concretes are introduced as highly resistent in acid environments, thus representing a possible green alternative to conventional cement-based construction materials.

Zeolitized bottom ashes from biomass combustion as cement replacing components,Biomass bottom ash; Natural radlonuclides; Activity Index; Zeolite; Supplementary cementitious materials,CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL,"In power plants biomass combustion produces large quantities of biomass bottom ash wastes. During the combustion process, the produced ashes are enriched in the radionuclides. The different enrichment of the various radionuclides within a radioactive series, such as that of Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228 , K-40, Pb-210 and Cs-137 results in the disturbance of radioactive secular equilibrium. The production of energy from renewable resources, such as biomass, is increasing rapidly. As the demand for bioenergy production increases, waste products from biomass combustion will increase too and will become a relevant environmental and economic problem. Therefore, environmentally friendly, and economic solutions to recycle the resulting by-products are essential. This research provides a real opportunity to save cement thus disposing the waste by using zeolitized biomass bottom ash as supplementary cementitious materials. The zeolitized products were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) spectroscopy and high-resolution gamma spectrometry. In all investigated cases, compressive strength in hardened cement pastes and concrete samples slightly increases by replacing from 3% to 5% of Portland cement with zeolitized ashes. The results showed that natural radionuclides as Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228, K-40 are concentrated in similar way as in case of ashes obtained from combustion. However, addition of biomass leads to concentration of artificial radionuclide Cs-137 that is still commonly present in biomass due to Chernobyl disaster. The observed activity concentration of Cs-137 reaches the level of natural radionuclides concentration. Taking into consideration the contribution of Cs-137 to gamma dose (usage of expanded activity index formula) may lead to exceeding the value of 1 in some cases. Calculated differences between activity indexes reach 13%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Development of carbon-capture binder using stainless steel argon oxygen decarburization slag activated by carbonation,Stainless steel slag; gamma-C2S; Carbonation; Carbon-capture; Binder; CO2 uptake,ROTATING PACKED-BED; ACCELERATED MINERAL CARBONATION; FLY-ASH; CO2 SEQUESTRATION; STEELMAKING SLAGS; PORTLAND CEMENTS; CONCRETE BLOCKS; HYDRATION; RATIO; PASTE,"The study aims at evaluating the possibility of using stainless-steel argon oxygen decarburization (AOD) slag containing gamma-C2S as a carbon-capture construction material. For this purpose, the physicochemical changes of paste specimens with different levels of AOD slag replacement up to 70% were investigated by means of carbonation curing. gamma-C2S is non-hydraulic, and hence, does not react with water at room temperature. After carbonation, however, gamma-C2S yields reaction products such as calcite and silica gel that fill up the pores within the cement paste creating a high-density microstructure. As a result, the carbonated specimens demonstrate increased compressive strength. Due to its relatively insoluble property under typical carbonation curing conditions, silica gel is formed on the surfaces of reacting gamma-C2S particles. Therefore, crystalline calcite and highly polymerized silica, formed as a result of CO2 curing, play an important role in achieving the desired strength. Their role could be considered similar to that of calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H), which are formed when concrete produced from Portland cement is hardened. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Freeze-Thaw Durability of Concrete with Natural and Recycled Concrete Aggregates Using Air-Entraining Admixture,recycled concrete aggregate; compressive strength; air-entraining admixtures; freeze-thaw durability; relative dynamic modulus,CONSTRUCTION; RESISTANCE,"Freezing and thawing cycles are one of the most damaging factors that affect the durability of concrete. The damages caused by cyclic freeze-thaw (F-T) action can be divided into two factors. The first factor is an increase in internal cracking, which causes the loss in relative dynamic modulus (RDM) of the concrete, and the second factor is surface scaling, which leads to weight loss of the concrete. In this study, the durability of concrete made by replacing natural coarse aggregates (NCA) with various percentages of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) is measured for an F-T test. Also, some tests have been conducted with the addition of air-entraining admixture (AEA). Prior to mixing the concrete, both NCA and RCA were characterized to determine their suitability as a construction material. Concrete mixes consisting of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % replacement (by weight) of NCA with RCA were prepared. The same concrete mixes were prepared again with the addition of AEA. All specimens were tested for compressive strength after a curing period of 7, 14, and 28 days. The compressive strength of the concrete made with different percentages of RCA decreases as the percentage of RCA increases. After 28 days of curing, sample with 0, 40, and 100 % replacement of NCA with RCA were placed without AEA in the F-T chamber, along with 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 % NCA replacements containing AEA. After several cycles of freezing and thawing, the RDM, change in weight, and change in length were measured. The RDM loss and weight loss were noticed, as the cyclic F-T durability increased. It has also been observed that concrete mixes containing AEA were still durable after 300 cycles of freezing and thawing; however, the specimens without AEA failed before 150 cycles.",2018
Thermal and mechanical properties of lightweight concretes based on waste aggregates,Lightweight concrete; Mechanical properties; Density; Thermal conductivity; Lightweight aggregate; Lytag; Boiler slag; Omega spheres,CONDUCTIVITY; COMPOSITES,"The aim of this study is to identify a construction material ensuring good mechanical properties and thermal insulation. The study also aimed at assessing the suitability of lightweight aggregates of waste origin such as lytag, boiler slag and omega spheres. On the basis of these components, using chemical admixtures, we tried to produce concrete with the lowest possible W/C ratios, but accordingly characterised by high compressive strength, low density and thermal conductivity parameters. The paper presents 8 mix formulas of lightweight concrete based on waste aggregates. An interesting aspect of the work was to compare different concrete formulas to determine the most advantageous parameters for future use. Substantial changes in formulas consisted in replacing lytag with boiler slag and introducing such components as omega spheres, micro-silica and fly ash. The use of waste aggregates (lytag, boiler slag) improved concrete characteristics. All presented formulas ensured high compressive strength and good thermal insulation performance. Significant porosity of the aggregates allowed for maintaining low density (1332-1749 kg/m(3)) and very good thermal properties of the material (0.388- 0.6 W/mK). After 28 days the compressive strength testing of the samples, depending on the composition of concrete mix, provided significant results as for lightweight concrete parameters reaching even 65 MPa.",2018

For example, the photocatalytic properties of TiO2 coatings, when exposed to UV light, have interesting environmental applications, such as air purification, self-cleaning and antibacterial properties. However, as reported in different pilot projects, serious durability problems, associated with the adhesion between the substrate and TiO2, have been evidenced. Thus, the aim of this work is to synthesize SiO2 together with TiO2 to increase the durability of the photocatalytic coating without affecting its photocatalytic potential. Therefore, synthesis using sonochemistry, synthesis without sonochemistry, physical characterization, photocatalytic evaluation, and durability of the SiO2, SiO2@TiO2 and TiO2 coatings are presented. Results indicate that using SiO2 improved the durability of the TiO2 coating without affecting its photocatalytic properties. Thus, this novel SiO2@TiO2 coating shows potential for developing long-lasting, self-cleaning and air-purifying construction materials.",2018

Compressive strength is a commonly used parameter for the assessment of concrete quality. Accurate prediction of concrete compressive strength is an important issue. In this study, we utilized an experimental procedure for the assessment of concrete quality. Firstly, the concrete mix was prepared according to C 20 type concrete, and slump of fresh concrete was about 20 cm. After the placement of fresh concrete to formworks, compaction was achieved using a vibrating screed. After 28 day period, a total of 100 core samples having 75 mm diameter were extracted. On the core samples pulse velocity determination tests and compressive strength tests were performed. Besides, Windsor probe penetration tests and Schmidt hammer tests were also performed. After setting up the data set, twelve artificial intelligence (Al) models compared for predicting the concrete compressive strength. These models can be divided into three categories (i) Functions (i.e., Linear Regression, Simple Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector Regression), (ii) Lazy-Learning Algorithms (i.e., IBk Linear NN Search, KStar, Locally Weighted Learning) (iii) TreeBased Learning Algorithms (i.e., Decision Stump, Model Trees Regression, Random Forest, Random Tree, Reduced Error Pruning Tree). Four evaluation processes, four validation implements (i.e., 10-fold cross validation, 5-fold cross validation, 10% split sample validation & 20% split sample validation) are used to examine the performance of predictive models. This study shows that machine learning regression techniques are promising tools for predicting compressive strength of concrete.",2018

Lower environmental impact alternatives focus on alkali-activated cements. In this paper, fluid catalytic cracking residue (FCC) was used to partially replace (0 wt %-50 wt %) ceramic sanitaryware (CSW) in alkali-activated systems. Samples were activated with NaOH and sodium silicate solutions and were cured at 65 degrees C for 7 days and at 20 degrees C for 28 and 90 days. In order to increase CSW/FCC binders' sustainability, the influence of reducing the silica concentration (from 7.28 mol.kg(-1) up to 2.91 mol.kg(-1)) was analyzed. The microstructure of the developed binders was investigated in pastes by X-ray diffraction, thermo tests and field emission scanning electron microscopy analyses. Compressive strength evolution was assessed in mortars. The results showed a synergetic effect of the CSW/FCC combinations so that, under the studied conditions, mechanical properties significantly improved when combining both waste materials (up to 70 MPa were achieved in the mortars containing 50 wt % FCC cured at room temperature for 90 days). Addition of FCC allowed CSW to be activated at room temperature, which significantly broadens the field of applications of alkali-activated CSW binders.",2018
THERMAL COMFORT IN TRADITIONAL HOUSE ARCHITECTURE WITHIN THE MESARYA REGION OF THE ISLAND OF CYPRUS,House; Climate; Temperature; Humidity; Building Material,,"Construction of houses by giving emphasis to health requirements is one of the most important aspect of the contemporary architecture. For the purpose of reaching to a right decision one has to add up a plus value to the past experiences. Traditional settlement areas in the mid Mesarya region of Cyprus are natural laboratories which scientifically will provide guidance to such plus values. In this study, by application of an Observation Method, construction systems, building materials and natural ventilation of rural houses built during a period beginning from the 19th century through the first half of the 20th century; under the Mediterranean semi-arid climate in the Mesarya region has been investigated. For the verification the findings obtained by such an Observation method, three houses in the village of Gonendere (Konetra) in the Mesarya region were chosen. The building systems of the first and the second houses were by the method of stacking up and the construction materials of the walls were by mud-bricks. The third house was built by a concrete frame and the walls were built by ordinary bricks. In order to be able to record the temperature and humidity values at every one hour intervals, appropriate instruments (Ebro Electronic Gmb H& Co, Model (EBL 20-TH) have been placed both indoors and outdoors under shade of each of the three houses during a one week period between the 23rd and 30th of August 2009. The same recordings have been continued during the months of December 2009 and January, February and March 2010. All data collected from these instruments has been also compared with data collected by the local meteorological stations.

Mechanical performance of statically loaded flat face epoxy bonded concrete joints,Marine concrete; Flat face joints; Surface preparation; Epoxy bonding; Shear testing; Mechanical performance,SUBSTRATE SURFACE; REPAIR MATERIALS; BONDING AGENT; STRENGTH; ROUGHNESS; INTERFACE; DRY,"One of the main challenges in the offshore renewable energy industry is the reduction in the levelised cost of energy of wind, wave and tidal devices. The use of concrete as the primary construction material in such devices presents a low unit cost, high marine durability alternative to steel, however, to maximise material efficiency factors such as mix constituent design, structural detailing and manufacturing processes have to take into account the specific conditions of the marine environment. Pre-cast segmental construction can be considered as one of the fastest and cheapest construction options. However the challenges regarding performance of epoxy bonded concrete in marine environment should be taken into account. This paper presents the results of an experimental programme on the performance of shear and tensile capacity of flat face concrete joints, focussing on the effect of substrate surface preparation, joint thickness, properties of epoxy resins, exposure to seawater and presence of joint defects on the ultimate failure load. The ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) method for detection of defects in the adhesive layer was examined and digital image correlation is used to observe the surface strain flow through the joint. The results indicate that the epoxy joints behave monolithically and remain undamaged under different types of static loading. The joints do not significantly interrupt the flow of strain but can locally affect the distribution of strain (and thus stiffness and stresses) in a structure. An increase in the density of the epoxy (and the filler content) leads to the increase in the joint strength and thicker joints are less affected by small defects in the bonding layer. The majority of tested specimens failed by cracking of concrete rather than by debonding of the joint, whilst compressive stresses acting on the joint can help to augment its shear strength. Sandblasting of bonded surfaces can improve performance of joints, whereas UPV testing may be used for quality control of epoxy-bonded joints.",2018
Fastening application in concrete using recycled tunnel excavation material,concrete technology; fastening systems; fiber-reinforced concrete; recycling of tunnel excavation material,SYSTEMS,"The demand for construction materials at tunnel construction sites is naturally very high. Thus, tunnel excavation material is increasingly used as a substitute for conventional mineral aggregates. Excavation material is not a standard product in terms of geometric, physical, and chemical properties of the rock as its quality is changes during tunnel driving depending on the geology and excavation method. By using this material as aggregate for concrete, the concrete obtains its characteristic properties. Certain concrete properties do not only influence the construction material itself but also fasten the elements that are assembled to the structural concrete. In this case, experimental validation of the usability of this special concrete for postinstalled anchorages and the effectiveness of different fastening systems are required. Therefore, investigations using various postinstalled anchor systems in different inner shell concrete types made of recycled aggregate (in this context, Bundner schist from the Brenner Base Tunnel) were performed in this study to obtain an assessment of the applicability of these systems in concrete with aggregate made of tunnel excavation material.",2018
Effect on Compressive Strength of Concrete Using Treated Waste Water for Mixing and Curing of Concrete,Recycled Aggregate; Fresh Water; Wastewater; Treated Wastewater; Treated Sewage; Concrete; Compressive Strength,,"Effective utilization of the available resources is imperative approach to achieve the apex of productivity. The modern world is focusing on the conditioning, sustainability and recycling of the assets by imparting innovative techniques and methodologies. Keeping this in view, an experimental study was conducted to evaluate the strength of concrete made with treated waste water for structural use. In this study ninety six cylinders of four mixes with coarse aggregates in combination with FW (Fresh Water), WW (Wastewater), TWW (Treated Wastewater) and TS (Treated Sewage)were prepared. The workability of fresh concrete was checked before pouring of cylinders. The test cylinders were left for 7,14,21 and 28 days for curing. After cu ring, the compressive strength was measured on hardened concrete cylinders accordingly. Test results showed that workability of all the four mixes were between 25-50mm but ultimate compressive strength of concrete with WW was decreased and with TWW, TS at the age of 28 days do not change significantly. This research will open a new wicket in the horizon of recycling of construction materials. The conditioning and cyclic utilization will reduce the cost of the construction and building materials as well as minimize the use of natural resources. This novelty and calculating approach will save our natural assets and resources.",2018
Prediction of Corner Columns' Load Capacity Using Composite Material Analogy,composite material analogy; sandwich columns; corner columns; axial loading,STRENGTH; JOINTS; SLABS,"There are numerous reasons for which concrete has become the most widely used construction material in buildings, one of them being its availability in different types, such as fiber-reinforced, lightweight, high strength, conventional and self-compacting concrete. This advantage is specially realized in high-rise building construction, where common construction practice is to use concretes of different types or strength classes in slabs and columns. Columns in such structures are generally made from concrete which is higher in compressive strength than the one used in floors or slabs. This raises issue of selection of concrete strength that should be used for estimating column capacity. Current paper tries to address this issue by testing nine (09) sandwich column specimens under axial loading. The floor concrete portion of the sandwich column was made of normal strength concrete, whereas column portions from comparatively higher strength concrete. Test results show that aspect ratio (h/b) influences the effective concrete strength of such columns. A previously adopted methodology of composite material analogy with some modifications has been found to predict well the capacity of columns where variation in floor and concrete strength is significant.",2018
New applications for single-sided nuclear magnetic resonance in building materials research,nuclear magnetic resonance; construction materials; concrete; polymer mortar; porosity moisture,,"Single-sided nuclear magnetic resonance NMR is a powerful tool to evaluate structure surface properties. Relevant information can be gained non-destructively up to a depth of 25 mm with highly precise depth resolutions. As with all non-destructive measurement techniques, single-sided NMR only provides indirect information. The interpretation requires experience as well as controlled laboratory measurements for correlation with material properties. In this paper, several examples for the application of single-sided NMR for the research on construction and rehabilitation materials are reported. The applications include the non-destructive evaluation of polymer mortars, the swelling behaviour of polymer roof membranes as well as the characterisation of mortar and concrete porosity. Limitations as well as future applications are discussed.",2018

From a civil engineering perspective, one of the most important issues for the conservation of historical buildings is to ensure the structural stability. For this purpose, it is necessary to determine the mechanical properties of the ancient construction materials. However, these structures cannot be evaluated by destructive tests due to politics and restrictions for preserving the heritage built. As a consequence, new methods that do not put in risk the integrity of the materials and the structure are becoming useful tools for researchers who work on structural engineering of heritage buildings. This paper presents a nondestructive method (NDM) that has been used to characterize the mechanical properties of different constructive systems of the San Antonio de Padua Temple, which is a religious icon in Aguascalientes, Mexico. This method includes the measuring of seismic waves' travel time in order to obtain shear and compressional velocity waves. Results show that with this method mechanical properties of masonry can be obtained such as Young's modulus, Poisson ratio and bulk density, which are needed for the structural analysis using numerical simulation models.",2018
Optimizing mortar extrusion using poplar wood sawdust for masonry building block,Extrusion; Sand mortars; Cement-based composites; Sawdust; Poplar wood; Buildingblocks,CEMENT; COMPATIBILITY; HYDRATION; COMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR; PASTES; PAPER,"The wood industry generates some 12 million tons of waste in France, 60% of which basically stems from sawmills. The reuse of this waste in the most common construction materials (e.g., concrete) may offer a sustainable solution. In the literature, the optimization of composites formulations generally focuses on aggregates plant pretreatment regardless of classical optimization parameters and the implementation process that can afford to get a high strength composite. The work presented herein is intended to optimize the mix design of a mortar made from poplar wood by-products, without involving any pretreatment. The conventional mix design parameters (i.e., paste volume, W/C ratio) have been varied. An optimal implementation technique (i.e., extrusion) was used. The wood mortar mix designs have been optimized in order to obtain composites compliant with French standard NF EN 771-3/CN, with respect to criteria regarding both dimensional tolerance and mechanical strength for structural elements (i.e., above 8 MPa at 7 days).A mortar mix design, optimized by means of extrusion, has been used as a reference. Poplar wood particles have been introduced through substitution for the sand volume. Test results indicate that the blocks produced from two wood mortar mixes with 60 and 70% wood aggregate-for-sand substitution rates are in line with the normative requirements relative to dimensional tolerances and mechanical strength. This material compliance underscores the potential use of such blocks as load-bearing masonry elements, thus facilitating the building of structures with a limited environmental impact.",2018
Assessing the greenhouse gas effects of harvested wood products manufactured from managed forests in Canada,,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; UNITED-STATES; RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION; BUILDING CONSTRUCTION; CARBON STOCKS; MITIGATION; SUBSTITUTION; IMPACTS; CONCRETE; ALTERNATIVES,"We developed a life-cycle analysis (LCA) system to quantify the carbon dynamics for Canadian-made harvested wood products (HWP). We considered the carbon stocks of HWP in use and in landfills/dumps, emissions reduced by substituting HWP for non-wood construction materials, HWP production emissions and methane emissions from decomposing wood disposed of in landfills. Carbon dynamics analyses were conducted for five HWP production scenarios. Results indicate structural panels have the highest potential in mitigating greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, followed by lumber and non-structural panels. Net GHG effects of Canadian-made HWP were evaluated by integrating HWP carbon dynamics with forest carbon analysis using four forest management units (a total of 2.21 million ha of forests managed for timber production) from Ontario, Canada, as a case study. If HWP substitution benefits were estimated using the average displacement factor, and the wood obtained by increasing harvesting (relative to the baseline harvest scenario) in these four management units is used for structural panel, lumber, non-structural panel and business as usual HWP production, 0, 21, 39 and 84 years are needed to achieve net emission reductions, respectively; net emission reductions were, respectively, estimated to be 112, 93, 66 and 21 Mt CO2-equivalent in 100 years. Our results suggest harvesting sustainably managed forests in Canada to produce long-lived solid HWP can significantly contribute to GHG mitigation.",2018
Experimental characterization of thermal and hygric properties of hemp concrete with consideration of the material age evolution,,HYGROSCOPIC BUILDING-MATERIALS; MOISTURE TRANSFER; ACOUSTICAL PROPERTIES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COUPLED HEAT; LIME; CONDUCTIVITY; FORMULATION; PARTICLES; CAPACITY,"The incorporation of plant crops in construction materials offers very good hygrothermal performance to the building, ensuring substantial environmental and ecological benefits. This paper focuses on studying the evolution of hygrothermal properties of hemp concrete over age (7, 30 and 60 days). The analysis is done with respect to two main hygric and thermal properties, respectively: sorption isotherms, water vapor permeability, thermal conductivity and heat capacity. In fact, most of these parameters are very susceptible to change function of the age of the material. This influence of the aging is mainly due to the evolution of the microstructure with the binder hydration over time and the creation of new hydrates which can reduces the porosity of the material and consequently modify its properties. All the tested hemp concrete samples presented high moisture storage capacity and high-water vapor permeability whatever the age of such hygroscopic material. These hygric parameters increase significantly for high relative humidity requiring more consideration of such variability during the modeling of coupled heat and mass transfer within the material. By the same, the thermal conductivity and heat capacity tests highlighted the impact of the temperature and hygric state of the studied material.",2018

Calcium carbonate is naturally precipitated as a byproduct of various microbial metabolic activities. This biological process was brought into practical use to restore construction materials, strengthen and remediate soil, and sequester carbon. MICP has also been extensively examined for applications in self-healing concrete. Biogenic crack repair helps mitigate the high maintenance costs of concrete in an eco-friendly manner. In this process, calcium carbonate precipitation (CCP)-capable bacteria and nutrients are embedded inside the concrete. These bacteria are expected to increase the durability of the concrete by precipitating calcium carbonate in situ to heal cracks that develop in the concrete. However, several challenges exist with respect to embedding such bacteria; harsh conditions in concrete matrices are unsuitable for bacterial life, including high alkalinity (pH up to 13), high temperatures during manufacturing processes, and limited oxygen supply. Additionally, many biological factors, including the optimum conditions for MICP, the molecular mechanisms involved in MICP, the specific microorganisms suitable for application in concrete, the survival characteristics of the microorganisms embedded in concrete, and the amount of MICP in concrete, remain unclear. In this paper, metabolic pathways that result in conditions favorable for calcium carbonate precipitation, current and potential applications in concrete, and the remaining biological challenges are reviewed.",2018
Radiation Attenuation and Stability of ClearView Radiation Shielding TMA Transparent Liquid High Radiation Shield,operational topics; accelerators; decommissioned; accidents; handling; Fukushima,,"Radiation exposure is a limiting factor to work in sensitive environments seen in nuclear power and test reactors, medical isotope production facilities, spent fuel handling, etc. The established choice for high radiation shielding is lead (Pb), which is toxic, heavy, and abidance by RoHS. Concrete, leaded (Pb) bricks are used as construction materials in nuclear facilities, vaults, and hot cells for radioisotope production. Existing transparent shielding such as leaded glass provides minimal shielding attenuation in radiotherapy procedures, which in some cases is not sufficient. To make working in radioactive environments more practicable while resolving the lead (Pb) issue, a transparent, lightweight, liquid, and lead-free high radiation shieldClearView Radiation Shielding(Radium Incorporated, 463 Dinwiddie Ave, Waynesboro, VA). was developed. This paper presents the motivation for developing ClearView, characterization of certain aspects of its use and performance, and its specific attenuation testing. Gamma attenuation testing was done using a 1.11 x 10(14) Bq Co-60 source and ANSI/HPS-N 13.11 standard. Transparency with increasing thickness, time stability of liquid state, measurements of physical properties, and performance in freezing temperatures are reported.

Effect of Temperature and Thermal Shock on Concrete Containing Hazardous Electronic Waste,Temperature; Thermal shock; Concrete; Electronic waste (E-waste); High-impact polystyrene (HIPS); Coarse aggregate,CEMENT MORTAR; PET BOTTLES; PLASTIC WASTE; AGGREGATE; FIBERS,"This paper presents an experimental investigation of the effect of temperature and thermal shock on the physical and mechanical properties of concrete (M25) incorporating electronic waste (E-waste). The concrete mixtures were prepared using 10, 20, 30, 40, 50% of E-waste plastic [high impact polystyrene (HIPS)] as a partial replacement per unit volume of coarse aggregate. The compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and surface hardness of concrete specimens were examined before and after the thermal exposure. The concrete cube specimens with HIPS were heated to 100, 200, and 300 degrees C for 1 h using muffle furnace. The compressive strength of specimens at room temperature was decreased with an increase of HIPS content. However, the specimens retained the compressive strength of about 50 at 50% HIPS replacement. Similarly, the compressive strength of specimens subjected to elevated temperatures after thermal shock decreased with an increase of HIPS and temperature. The nondestructive tests were carried out using a rebound hammer and ultrasonic pulse velocity test. The rebound hammer results provides very consistent results similar to experimental values. Regardless the temperature, concrete incorporated upto 25% HIPS showed an ultrasonic pulse velocity within the limiting value 3,000 m/s. This study shows the feasiblility of using E-waste plastic (HIPS) in concrete as construction material in order to reduce the environmental pollution and conserve the natural resource from depletion.

"Beyond the Sorptivity: Definition, Measurement, and Properties of the Secondary Sorptivity",,WATER; SATURATION; CONCRETE,"Capillary imbibition in brick, stone, and concrete occurs in two stages. The primary process, which occurs in the standard test to measure sorptivity, is a spontaneous imbibition in which air is displaced by the invading liquid (usually water). In primary imbibition, the displacement of air is incomplete, and some air is trapped. The residual air content lies usually in the range 0.1-0.4 of the volume-fraction porosity. Primary imbibition is followed by a much slower secondary process in which trapped air in the interior of the material dissolves in the liquid phase and diffuses to the unsealed external surfaces, where it escapes. As air is lost, there is further imbibition of liquid to replace it. Eventually, all trapped air is lost, and the material reaches saturation. There is current interest in using the rate of secondary imbibition to define a secondary sorptivity, and speculation that this may be a useful property for characterizing porous construction materials, particularly in relation to durability. This paper analyzes the secondary imbibition process and provides a definition of the secondary sorptivity which is independent of the dimensions of the test specimen. The analysis is supported by experimental data on Ancaster and Portland limestone test materials.",2018
Mechanical properties of aerated cement slurry-infiltrated chicken mesh,Compressive strength; Flexure strength; Ferrocement; Foamed cement; Lightweight structures; Composite structures,FOAM CONCRETE,"Aerated slurry-infiltrated chicken mesh was evaluated as a ductile and lightweight material for building construction. The compressive strength of the aerated slurry, and the tensile, compressive and flexural behavior of the aerated slurry-infiltrated chicken mesh were evaluated. Aerated slurry provided a relatively low compressive strength, which did not suit load-bearing applications. Aerated slurry infiltrated chicken mesh, on the other hand, provided desired mechanical properties, including significantly improved compressive strength, for load-bearing applications. The system exhibited a ductile failure mode which can be attributed to the high specific surface area and the desired mechanical interlocking of the chicken mesh reinforcement. The effects of aeration on the system behavior were evaluated. A theoretical model was developed for evaluating the mechanical behavior of aerated slurry infiltrated chicken mesh. Aerated slurry-infiltrated chicken mesh offers a desired combination of light weight and mechanical characteristics for use as a building construction material. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of roughness on interface shear behavior of sand with steel and concrete surface,interface; surface roughness; direct shear test; peak interface angle; residual interface angle; constitutive modeling,SOIL-STRUCTURE INTERFACE; BOX TESTS; STRENGTH; FRICTION; CAPACITY; SIZE,"The present study evaluates the interface shear strength between sand and different construction materials, namely steel and concrete, using direct shear test apparatus. The influence of surface roughness, mean size of sand particles, relative density of sand and size of the direct shear box on the interface shear behavior of sand with steel and concrete has been investigated. Test results show that the surface roughness of the construction materials significantly influences the interface shear strength. The peak and residual interface friction angles increase rapidly up to a particular value of surface roughness (critical surface roughness), beyond which the effect becomes negligible. At critical surface roughness, the peak and residual friction angles of the interfaces are 85-92% of the peak and residual internal friction angles of the sand. The particle size of sand (for morphologically identical sands) significantly influences the value of critical surface roughness. For the different roughness considered in the present study, both the peak and residual interaction coefficients lie in the range of 0.3-1. Moreover, the peak and residual interaction coefficients for all the interfaces considered are nearly identical, irrespective of the size of the direct shear box. The constitutive modeling of different interfaces followed the experimental investigation and it successfully predicted the pre-peak, peak and post peak interface shear response with reasonable accuracy. Moreover, the predicted stress-displacement relationship of different interfaces is in good agreement with the experimental results. The findings of the present study may also be applicable to other non-yielding interfaces having a similar range of roughness and sand properties.",2018

To make this production of construction materials cleaner, the dependency on natural resources has to be reduced. With this aim, marble powder which is a waste product generated during cutting and shaping of marble blocks has been evaluated as a replacement of conventional river sand in cement mortars. For this, four different mix proportions of mortars were evaluated in terms of workability, drying shrinkage, compressive strength, bond and adhesive strengths, density, water absorption and dynamic Young's modulus. Results show that mortar mixes with 20% substitution of river sand by marble powder can be used for masonry and rendering purposes. Such mortars have a distinctively dense microstructure which is a consequence of reduced water requirement and formation of superior quality of hydration products. These were confirmed by scanning electron microscope, thermogravimetric analysis and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Hence, by replacing sand to the tune of 20% by marble powder, would enable the construction industry to reduce their dependency on river sand. Additionally, by utilizing this non-biodegradable marble waste as a building material, would reduce the burden on landfills and therefore help the marble stone industry to be more sustainable.

This study proposed an innovative method to utilize alum sludge as a partial replacement of recycled fine aggregate for producing controlled low strength material (CLSM). Various supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) and accelerators were incorporated to produce CLSM with high flowability (>200 mm), relatively short stiffening time (<24 h), and moderate compressive strength (0.3-1 MPa). Cement chemistry and microstructure characteristics were evaluated by using isothermal calorimeter, quantitative X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy analysis. The addition of alum sludge significantly increased water demand for maintaining sufficient flowability, resulting in long final stiffening time and low compressive strength. The high content of organic matter in alum sludge hampered the Ca(OH)(2) formation and pH increase, thus delaying the induction period of cement hydration. The binder composition played an important role in the stiffening time of CLSM. Pulverized fly ash (PFA) was found to be the most effective SCM for improving flowability and adjusting compressive strength. Calcium-based accelerators or triethanolamine (TEA) significantly shortened the stiffening time to 7.4 h, which facilitated the samples to fulfill all the CLSM requirements.

With the advancement in technology, concrete is no longer seen as a composite of three elements (binder, aggregate, and water). The distinctive workability properties of SCC make it unique in the concrete industry. This review has assessed the materials, strength and rheological properties of agricultural waste, industrial waste and mineral additives in SCC production. The effect of the utilization of these additives and replacements on structural, mechanical and rheological properties of SCC has been studied. This review has revealed that the use of both industrial and agricultural waste enhances the strength properties of SCC. Additionally, the use of agricultural waste improves the rheological properties of fresh concrete. The utilization of expansive materials should be discouraged in SCC production. This review has revealed that SCC developments ensure a good balance between deformability and stability. It is therefore recommended that SCC is utilized in pavement construction, particularly when high axle load is expected.",2018
Investigation of Some Engineering Properties of Concrete Made With Recycled Aggregate in Different Ratios,Recycled concrete aggregate; waste concrete; compressive strength; wetting and drying; bond strength between rebars and concrete,BOND BEHAVIOR; STEEL REBARS; FLY-ASH; SHRINKAGE; STRENGTH,"Nowadays concrete is the most commonly used construction material. Many researchers are investigating the use of recycled aggregate in concrete because 70-75% of concrete is composed of aggregates and using aggregates produced from waste concrete has environmental, ecologic and economic impacts and reduces the energy and natural resources consumption. In this study properties of aggregates provided from crushing waste concrete and also engineering properties of concrete made from these aggregates have been investigated. Fine and coarse recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) were replaced in the ratio of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% with fine and coarse crushed aggregates in concrete mix design. CEM I 42,5 R cement was used as a binder and replaced by 20% of the cement's weight with fly ash in all mixtures. Due to the high water absorption of the RCA in comparison to the crushed aggregates, the slump was decreased by increasing RCA substitution ratio in the mixtures. Control concrete (CC) has gained the highest compressive strength in all ages. 28 and 90-day compressive strength of normally cured concretes, the bond strength between concrete specimens and rebars and compressive strength of concretes subjected to the wetting and drying cycles were decreased by increasing RCA substitution ratio in the mixtures.",2018
THE APPLICATION OF METALLURGICAL TECHNOGENIC PRODUCTS AS RAW MATERIALS FOR ROAD CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS,asphalt concrete; converter slag; hardening system; physical and chemical properties; road construction,,"The possibility is established of intensifying the processes of structure formation and improving the properties of asphalt concrete compositions due to the use of converter slags in them. The possibility of obtaining asphalt concretes on porous slag aggregates with the use of metallurgical waste as a mineral dust was confirmed. The research show the possibility of reducing the consumption of bitumen to 6% in asphalt concretes on porous slag aggregates. The research justifies the technology of using converter slags in road fills and bases, in asphalt concretes together with the ""Recommendations on the technology of using converter slags in the structural elements of road pavement from asphalt concrete."" The investigated aggregates from powder waste of local industry meet the requirements of the regulatory documentation and can be recommended for the application in asphalt concretes. This makes it possible to utilize finely dispersed industrial waste, which contributes to the reduction of environmental pollution of the industrial zone, of groundwater and of the atmosphere with land waste products and waste run-off products.",2018

Although there is ample research available on the behavior of FRP bars and concrete members reinforced with FRP bars under elevated temperatures (due to fire), there is little published information available on their post-fire residual load capacity. This paper reports residual tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and bond strength (to concrete) of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars after exposure to elevated temperatures of up to 400 degrees C and subsequent cooling to an ambient temperature. The results showed that the residual strength generally decreases with increasing temperature exposure. However, as much as 83% of the original tensile strength and 27% of the original bond strength was retained after the specimens were heated to 400 degrees C and then cooled to ambient temperature. The residual bond strength is a critical parameter in post-fire strength assessments of GFRP-reinforced concrete members.",2018
A comparative study on bond strength of normal and geopolymer concrete to steel bar,geopolymer; concrete; bond strength; bond slip,BEHAVIOR,"One of the new construction materials evolved as a replacement of Ordinary Portland cement concrete is geopolymer concrete. Many investigations have been done to develop geopolymer concrete as a material but studies on structural use of geopolymer concrete are very rare. This paper presents the experimental investigation on the bond behaviour of normal and geopolymer concrete. The bond strength behaviour of 27 geopolymer concrete prisms of size 100x100x200 mm(3) of grades M20, M35 and M50 reinforced with 16 mm TMT rod is studied using pull out tests. An equation for the bond strength of geopolymer concrete is obtained from the experimental results and is also validated. The normalized bond-slip behaviour of GPC can be idealized as the curve of two variables.",2018
High-velocity impact behaviour of a new hybrid fibre-reinforced cementitious composite,engineered cementitious composite; impact; impact resistance; polyvinyl-alcohol fibres; steel fibres,STRAIN-HARDENING BEHAVIOR; PVA-ECC; CONCRETE; RESISTANCE,"In this article, a new engineered cementitious composite reinforced with 0.6% volume steel fibres and 1.5% volume polyvinyl-alcohol fibres is developed aiming for enhanced impact resistance compared to other construction materials. Fundamental mechanical properties of the new composite including the compressive strength, Young's modulus, tensile strength and flexural behaviour were tested. To calibrate the impact resistance of the new composite, high-velocity impact tests of panels made of the new material were conducted when subjected to impact from a standard 7.62 mm round in-service bullet fired from a knight armament SR-25 military rifle. For comparison, plain concrete panels and concrete panels reinforced with 2% volume steel fibres were also tested. The post-impact responses of the panels in terms of crater sizes, damage failure mode, fragmentation size, weight and regress velocity are analysed and compared to characterize the impact resistance of the new engineered cementitious composite. The test results demonstrate significantly enhanced impact and shatter resistance of the new hybrid fibre-reinforced cementitious composite with reduced spalling and fragmentation, localized damage areas and improved cracking resistance.",2018

This article presents an experimental and numerical study on the static and dynamic behaviour of an existing ultra-high performance concrete material. Experimental study on its flexural behaviour under static loads is conducted and an inverse study is carried out to derive its uniaxial tensile constitutive law. The derived relationship is used in the material model in hydro-code LS-DYNA together with dynamic material properties to study ultra-high performance concrete columns under blast loads. The residual loading capacity of the column is studied and pressure-impulse diagrams for assessing the ultra-high performance concrete column damage under blast loads are proposed. Parametric study on effects of ultra-high performance concrete strength, column height, cross-section size and reinforcement ratio is performed and analytical equations are proposed for generating pressure-impulse diagrams for generic ultra-high performance concrete columns.",2018
Plain and Ultrafine Fly Ashes Mortars for Environmentally Friendly Construction Materials,ultrafine fly ash; fly ash; high volume fly ash; replacement of Portland cement; sustainability,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; PERFORMANCE; FINENESS; COAL,"This paper is aimed to study the rheological and physical performance of mortars manufactured replacing Portland-based cements with low calcium siliceous fly ash (FA) or ultrafine fly ash (UFFA). Five different types of cement (CEM I, CEM II/A-LL, CEM III/A, CEM III/B, and CEM IV according to EN 197-1) were used. Mortars were manufactured with FA or UFFA replacing 5%, 15%, 25%, 35%, and 50% of cement mass. Results indicate that compressive strength of mortars with UFFA is considerably higher than that of mixtures containing traditional FA, both at early and long ages. Moreover, experimental data reveal that replacement of cement with up to 25% of UFFA determines higher compressive strength at 7, 28, and 84 days than plain mortars (containing cement only), regardless of the type of cement used. Mortars manufactured with 35% or 50% of UFFA show slightly lower or similar compressive strength compared to the reference mortar (containing cement only). In addition, the results show values of the strength activity index of mortars made with FA 25%, 23%, and 20% lower than the reference corresponding mortars (cement only) at 7, 28, and 84 days, respectively. The grinding of FA, despite resulting in an increase in production energy and CO2 emissions compared to unmilled FA, allows a wide use of these SCM (Supplementary Cementitious Materials) in place of cement, reducing the environmental impact of mortars up to 40% at the 28-day strength class. The use of UFFA ensures better resistance in CaCl2-rich environments.",2018

The dispersion efficiency of GO in aqueous solution is examined by Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy and it is found that GO sheets are well dispersed. Thereafter, rheological properties, flow diameter, hardened density, compressive strength and electrical properties of GO based cement composite are investigated by incorporating 0.03% GO in cement matrix. The reasons for improvement in strength are also discussed. Rheological results confirm that GO influenced the flow behavior and enhanced the viscosity of the cement based system. From XRD and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) results, it is found that more hydration occurred when GO was incorporated in cement based composite. The GO based cement composite improves the compressive strength and density of mortar by 27% and 1.43%, respectively. Electrical properties results showed that GO-cement based composite possesses self-sensing characteristics. Hence, GO is a potential nano-reinforcement candidate and can be used as self-sensing sustainable construction material.",2018
APPLICATION OF FIBERS FROM END-OF-LIFE TIRES AS A SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT - AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY,Fibers from end-of-life tyres; Self-compacting concrete; Flexural tensile strength,STEEL FIBERS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; FLEXURAL BEHAVIOR; WASTE TIRES; PERFORMANCE; STRENGTH; COMPOSITES; RATIO; SCC,"Concrete reinforced with various types of fibers is increasingly used construction material. The currently applied steel fibers are characterized by various geometrical parameters and are produced specially for this purpose. The paper deals with application of steel fibers coming from end-of-life tires (RSF) in self-compacting concrete. The geometry of RSF with small diameter, variable length and their curved longitudinal shape causes doubts in their effectiveness in the concrete mix in comparison to industrial fibers. To clarify the real influence of RSF on mechanical properties of self- compacting concrete (SCC) the compression and flexural tests were evaluated. The high amounts of RSF equal to 1% and 1.5% were choosen. As expected, RSF slightly influenced the compressive strength of SCC. The results from the four-point flexural tensile tests demonstrate that the RSF fibers were not only a material that improves the ductility of brittle SCC matrix but also were uniformly distributed in the matrix. The high amounts of RSF truly decreased the rheological parameters of SCC, what was tested in slump flow and L-box test, however, did not have a negative influence on the homogeneity of the mix. Concluding, the fibers from end-of-life tires were fibers that can be successfully used as a randomly distributed reinforcement of self-compacting concrete.",2018
Assessment of Radioactivity in Concrete Made with e-Waste Plastic,building materials; radioactivity; radon emanation; electronic waste; concrete; coarse aggregate,NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY,"The paper reports the impact of e-waste plastic [high-impact polystyrene (HIPS)] mixing in concrete on its radioactivity profile. The concrete was prepared with HIPS as a partial replacement for coarse aggregate in varying percentages by volume and radioactivity concentrations of U-238, Th-232, and K-40 were measured using gamma-ray spectrometer and radon activity by solid state nuclear track detector (SSNTD) technique. Both gamma radiation and radon activity in standard concrete and concrete with HIPS were well within the permissible limit. However, the gamma-radiation level and radon activity decreased with an increase in HIPS content of the concrete. The study concludes that the concrete with HIPS does not pose any radiation hazard and, hence, is suitable as a construction material.",2018

The characteristics of the foam before the lightweight structure sets and maintains its shape has a great impact on the properties of foamed concretes. The tendency of the foams to coalesce and collapse during the preparation process brings some challenges in controlling the properties of cellular structures. Consequently, it is critical to improve the stability of fresh foams in order to produce high quality cellular structures using a predictable and reliable approach. Aggregating the liquid film around bubbles is known to be effective in improving the stability of foams, but the impact of this stabilizing method has not been investigated for foam concrete applications. In this paper, Xanthan gum (with a thickening capacity) has been utilized as the foam stabilizer to aggregate the liquid film. This stabilizing method is shown to significantly enhance the pore size distribution of foam concretes. The resulting pre-made foams are remarkably more stable than the control foam, and the mechanical properties of the final cellular structure are considerably improved (about 34% in mechanical foaming and 20% in the chemical foaming technique).

Development of porous lightweight clay bricks using a replication method,Brick; Replication; Porosity; Thermal insulation,THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; BLACK,"This study focused on porous lightweight clay bricks as a construction material as opposed to autoclaved aerated concrete and pumice blocks. Traditional clay bricks exhibit good stability against environmental conditions and are an economical alternative compared to other construction materials. Furthermore, clay bricks have better mechanical properties than autoclaved aerated concrete and pumice blocks but poorer thermal insulation properties; hence, their use in buildings is becoming increasingly unfavourable. This study focused on developing porous lightweight clay bricks with relatively better thermal insulation properties using a replication method.",2018
Two Possible New Techniques for Determining the Early-Age Shear Strength of Shotcrete: Auger Penetrometer and Vane Shear Tester,Shotcrete; Concrete; Early age strength; Shear strength; Compressive strength; Construction materials; Auger Penetrometer; Vane Shear tester; Meyco penetrometer,LOAD RESISTANCE; LININGS,"Shotcrete or sprayed concrete is widely used as ground support in the construction of tunnels. The early-age strength development of shotcrete is very important because it influences the determination of safe re-entry times beneath the tunnel heading. This study has examined the possible application of a handheld soil vane shear tester and a handheld auger penetrometer for testing the early-age strength of shotcrete. This is achieved by measuring the shear strength because previous research in this area indicates that the shear failure dominates the early-age resistance of shotcrete. The investigation involved testing of three techniques, which resulted in readings of both compressive and shear strengths. Shear testing involved a combination of the vane shear tester and the auger penetrometer, which obtains its readings through auger penetration and rotation. The compression testing involved the use of the Meyco needle penetrometer, which was tested on the same cast specimens as the shear tests and at the same time intervals. In this paper, the term shotcrete has been used for the special normal concrete, with a simple shotcrete mix design, used in this investigation. Strong correlations were found among the vane shear strength, auger penetrometer shear strength, Meyco penetrometer compressive strength, and time after pouring, for up to 4h of testing. The shear strength results from the auger penetrometer and the vane shear tester are very similar, and there is almost a perfect linear correlation between the results from these two methods.

Improved numerical approach for evaluating the behavior of reinforced concrete members with flexural strengthening using strain hardening cementitious composite,Improved numerical approach; SHCC; Flexural strengthening RC member; Zero-span tensile model with fictitious material; Tensile strain capacity variation,REPAIR,"Strain hardening cementitious composite (SHCC) is an attractive construction material used for reinforced concrete (RC) strengthening, and a simplified method has been previously proposed for evaluating the behavior of SHCC flexural strengthening RC member (Zhang, Engineering Fracture Mechanics 2014; 121-122: 11-27), whereas the load carrying capacity of strengthened RC member is over-estimated using the simplified method. In this study, a numerical approach improved from the aforementioned method is presented for accurately evaluating the behavior of SHCC flexural strengthening RC member, considering the influence of the tensile strain capacity of SHCC, presence of localized concrete cracks and varying SHCC layer thickness, in which a zero-span tensile model with fictitious material is adopted to obtain the average tensile behavior of SHCC layer for strengthening RC member with crack.

Fiber-reinforced concrete with low content of recycled steel fiber: Shear behaviour,Fiber reinforced concrete; Recycled steel fibers; Waste tyres; Shear behaviour,WASTE TIRES; STRENGTH; STRESS; MATRIX; BEAMS,"The sustainability of construction materials is a mandatory issue that started to be strongly felt in view of a global perspective of environmental protection. Wasted materials often may find a new lifecycle if well re-engineered, even in structural applications. In this field short steel fibers obtained from used tyres at the end of their life may find promising applications within a concrete matrix, In the present research the mechanical properties of recycled steel fiber-reinforced concrete in terms of workability, compressive and tensile strength, toughness and shear behaviour are analysed and compared with those of industrial steel fiber-reinforced concrete and ordinary Portland concrete. An experimental campaign is illustrated, and an extensive comparison in terms of shear strength has been studied considering different experimental works available in scientific literature. Moreover, a theoretical analysis aimed at evaluating and comparing the shear modulus of the analysed concrete type was carried out. The results obtained through this study show a satisfactory behaviour of the concrete reinforced with recycled steel fibers compared with industrial new steel fibers reinforced concrete, both in terms of toughness and shear behaviour.

The chloride penetration was studied by means of EIS. A new equivalent circuit model was applied to describe the electrochemical system of fly ash blended cementitious materials. Experimental results demonstrate that the increase in the fly ash replacement ratio of sample can increase the penetration depth of chloride ion. In addition, the increase in the fly ash replacement ratio of sample can enlarge the Nyquist curve semi-circle, and improve ion transfer resistance at the solid-liquid phase interface. We determined the quantitative relationship between electrochemical properties and chloride penetration depth in order to successfully predict the chloride ion penetration depth of blended cements with varying fly ash content.

The axial strength values of the developed materials on the 3rd day of curing reached till 5.9 MPa; after the 7th day - till 6.8 MPa; after the 28th day - 7.9 MPa and after the 365th day 13.4 MPa. The water absorption values after 28 days of curing went from 1233 to 13.86% and at 90 days - between 11.18 and 12.74%. The expansion coefficient of the test specimens after 28 days of curing varied between 1.1 and 2.6% and after 365 days between 0.9% and 2.2%.

In particular, the use of carbon nanofillers into the matrix of construction materials can provide enhanced properties to the material in both of mechanical and electrical performance. In constructions, concrete is among the most used material. Due to the peculiarities of its components and its structure, it is suitable to modifications, at the nanometer level too. Moreover, to guarantee structural safety it is desirable to achieve a diffuse monitoring of structures in order to identify incipient situations of damages and possible risk for people. The ideal solution would be to realize structures able to identify easily and quickly their behavior modifications. This paper presents a research work about the characterization of the self-sensing abilities of novel cementitious composites with conductive carbon nanoinclusions and their application into a structural reinforced concrete beam. The self-sensing evidence is achieved through the correlation between the variation of strains and the variation of electrical resistance or resistivity.

EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF CONCRETE BEAMS WITH SHREDDED PLASTICS,flexural theory; beam with plastics; alternative concrete component; waste utilization,,"In recent years, more attention is being paid to alternative disposal of wastes to lessen the harmful impact of these wastes to the environment. In the construction industry, alternative disposal of waste comes in the form of utilization of waste as a substitute construction material. Plastic, typically in the form of plastic bags and bottles, is one of the most abundant wastes in Manila, and, also among the most problematic when it comes to disposal due to its non-biodegradable nature. Hence, more attention is given to alternative use of plastics as a substitute material in construction. In this study, experimental investigation was conducted to assess the performance of concrete beams with shredded plastics, sourced out locally, as a supplementary material. Strength properties of a concrete beam, in terms of compression, tension, and flexure, were investigated for both plain concrete and concrete with shredded plastics. Results showed that concrete with shredded plastics were slightly higher than that of plain concrete in terms of tension and compression strength. Flexural strength of concrete with shredded plastic, also showed higher strength than that of plain concrete. Additionally, this study showed the applicability of elastic flexural theory to concrete beams with plastics.",2018
MACROCELL CORROSION ASSESSMENT OF STEEL IN COLD-JOINTED CONCRETE MIXED AND CURED IN SEAWATER,Macrocell Corrosion; Seawater; Cold-Joints; Fly Ash; Water To Cement Ratio,CHLORIDE ENVIRONMENTS; MICROCELL,"Previous research works have been devoted to developing sustainable construction materials. This is due to the potential risk of global warming resulting from the abuse and misuse of natural resources. Therefore, this study aims to address this through the use of abundant and by-product resources in the production of concrete, like seawater and fly ash. If these materials were proven comparable to conventional materials, then problems on freshwater scarcity, fluctuating supply of cement and associated pollutants from its production can be addressed. This research specifically concentrates on the effects of varying water to cement ratios and fly ash content on the macrocell corrosion behavior of steel in cold-jointed concrete. Ordinary Portland cement in concrete was partially replaced with fly ash at 30% and 50%. Water to cement (w/c) ratios of 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.55 and 0.60 were tested. Rectangular prism specimens were cast to monitor the macrocell corrosion activity of the reinforcements. Results have shown an increasing trend of corrosion rate with increasing w/c ratios regardless of mixing water, with specimens mixed with seawater having higher values compared to freshwater. Generally, the 0.30 w/c ratio resulted to the lowest corrosion susceptibility. In terms of fly ash content, it was found that corrosion rate decreases with increasing fly ash percentage. Fly ash decreases the permeability of concrete, thus making it less exposed to aggressive environments. Cold-joints showed evident corrosion effects as external elements may penetrate through these planes of weakness in the concrete.",2018
Characterisation and management of concrete grinding residuals,Concrete; mortar; grinding residue; beneficial use; CGR management,PORTLAND-CEMENT,"Concrete grinding residue is the waste product resulting from the grinding, cutting, and resurfacing of concrete pavement. Potential beneficial applications for concrete grinding residue include use as a soil amendment and as a construction material, including as an additive to Portland cement concrete. Concrete grinding residue exhibits a high pH, and though not hazardous, it is sufficiently elevated that precautions need to be taken around aquatic ecosystems. Best management practices and state regulations focus on reducing the impact on such aquatic environment. Heavy metals are present in concrete grinding residue, but concentrations are of the same magnitude as typically recycled concrete residuals. The chemical composition of concrete grinding residue makes it a useful product for some soil amendment purposes at appropriate land application rates. The presence of unreacted concrete in concrete grinding residue was examined for potential use as partial replacement of cement in new concrete. Testing of Florida concrete grinding residue revealed no dramatic reactivity or improvement in mortar strength.",2018

Uniaxial tension tests on different gage length wheat straws are conducted to determine the mechanical properties. Fourier transform infrared test and pH tests are performed to confirm the chemical composition and acidity/alkalinity of wheat straw, respectively. The microstructural morphology of untested wheat straw and failure modes in failed wheat straw are investigated. Naive Bayes (NB) algorithm is trained and is used to classify or determine the gage length of the wheat straw based on target mechanical properties. In the end, a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model is calibrated to predict the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of wheat straw. The UTS and fracture strain decreased with increase in gage length. Wheat straw is found to have a pH value of 7.43 and presence of lignocellulosic functional groups is verified through FTIR. Both mode-I and mixed mode failures are observed in wheat straws. The trained NB classifier is able to categorize the wheat straws in to different gage lengths with an accuracy of 92% and the calibrated MLR model is able to predict the UTS of wheat straw fairly well.

Recent advances in the wood construction field have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of using wood-based materials in tall building structures and other massive constructive uses, which could lead to a net reduction in CO(2)eq emissions from the construction sector by replacing high-energy consuming materials such as concrete or steel with wood and biomass-based materials. Among these biomass-based materials are non-timber forest products. This category includes plants that can provide important contributions to the construction sector by diversifying the sources of biomass-based materials. One of these plants is totora (Schoenoplectus californicus (C.A. Mey.) Sojak). Totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in the Americas, from California to Chile, and some of the Pacific islands. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, and material for building houses, boats, and different handicrafts. Although several people still use totora to make their handicrafts and rafts, the most important current examples of the use of totora are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live, with methods based almost exclusively on the totora culms. The studies and experimentation conducted on this plant have underscored its fast growth capacity, high yield values, anatomical and physical properties, and potential environmental benefits. This review aims to analyze the available data on this material regarding its potential for construction, which is intended to foster its research and development as an alternative source of a biomass-based building material.",2018
A Study on the Analysis of CO2 Emissions of Apartment Housing in the Construction Process,apartment housing; construction process; CO2 emissions,BUILDINGS; LCA,"Recent research in the construction industry has focused on the reduction of CO2 emission using quantitative assessment of building life. However, most of this research has focused on the operational stage of a building's life cycle. Few comprehensive studies of CO2 emissions during building construction have been performed. The purpose of this study is to analyze the CO2 emissions of an apartment housing during the construction process. The quantity of CO2 emissions associated with the utilization of selected building materials and construction equipment were used to estimate the CO2 emissions related to the apartment housing life cycle. In order to set the system boundary for the construction materials, equipment, and transportation used, 13 types of construction work were identified; then the CO2 emissions produced by the identified materials were calculated for each type of construction work. The comprehensive results showed that construction work involving reinforced concrete accounted for more than 73% of the total CO2 emissions. The CO2 emissions related to reinforced concrete work was mainly due to transportation from the supplier to the construction site. Therefore, at the time that reinforced concrete is being supplied, shipping distance and fuel economy management of concrete transportation vehicles should be considered thoroughly for significant reduction of CO2 emissions.",2018

Therefore, this study aimed at modeling the potential fate of ENMs by using the example of the Japanese construction sector and by conducting a dynamic material flow analysis. Expert interviews and national reports revealed that about 3920-4660 tons of ENMs are annually used for construction materials in Japan. Nanoscale TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3 and carbon black have already been applied for decades to wall paints, road markings or concrete. The dynamic material flow model indicates that in 2016 about 95% of ENMs, which have been used since their year of market penetration, remained in buildings, whereas only 5% ended up in the Japanese waste management system or were diffusely released into the environment. Considering the current Japanese waste management system, ENMs were predicted to end up in recycled materials (40-47%) or in landfills (36-41%). It was estimated that only a small proportion was used in agriculture (5-7%, as ENM-containing sewage sludges) or was diffusely released into soils, surface waters or the atmosphere (5-19%). The results indicate that ENM release predominantly depend on their specific applications and characteristics. The model also highlights the importance of adequate collection and treatment of ENM-containing wastes. In future, similar dynamic flow models for other countries should consider, inasmuch as available, historical data on ENM production (e.g. like declaration reports that are annually published by relevant public authorities or associations), as such input data is very important regarding data reliability in order to decrease uncertainties and to continuously improve model accuracy. In addition, more environmental monitoring studies that aim at the quantification of ENM release and inadvertent transfer, particularly triggered by waste treatment processes, would be needed in order to validate such models.

Fast-growing bio-based materials as an opportunity for storing carbon in exterior walls,Carbon storage; Wall; Fast-growing materials; Biogenic materials; Dynamic life cycle assessment; LCA,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; FOREST MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; BIOGENIC CARBON; BUILDING-MATERIALS; CLIMATE IMPACT; CO2 EMISSIONS; WOOD; LIME; TIME; DIFFUSION,"Storing carbon in construction products and building components seems a particularly attractive strategy for compensating the initial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from production and construction. Typically, in LCA methods, when a sustainable forestry management is assumed, biogenic carbon is not included in the calculation since forest products are considered as carbon neutral due to the full regeneration of biomass in forest at the end of a rotation period. The purpose of this article is to investigate the effect of storing carbon in biogenic materials and lime-based products when they are used as construction materials and left long in a building. Five different alternative exterior walls with different construction technologies are compared. In the first two alternatives (STR and HEM), a significant amount of fast-growing biogenic material is used as thermal insulation, while the third (TIM) represents a typical timber frame structure with mineral insulation. The last two are traditional wall alternatives based on bricks (BRI) and cast concrete (CON) with an additional external thermal insulation composite system (ETICS) in EPS. A model based on a dynamic LCA is adopted to include timing in the calculation. The results, expressed in terms of radiative forcing in the atmosphere, show that storing carbon in fast-growing biogenic materials is much more efficient than in timber elements. The carbon stored in fast-growing biogenic materials is fully captured by crop regrowth only one year after construction, while a longer time is expected for forest products due to the long rotation period required for forest regrowth.",2018

This has changed in recent years; new compositions are now being developed, with new properties, using nano-additives, fibres and capsules. In this work, surfaces with new and innovative functionalities that promote energy savings and improve air quality have been developed and studied. Incorporation of phase change materials (PCM) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles in construction products is currently under study by different research groups. However, these studies only address their incorporation separately. Adding new additives into the mortar's matrix can be complex-due to microstructural modifications that will influence both fresh and hardened state properties. Moving from a single additive to multiple additions, as in this study, increases the system's complexity. Only with a good understanding of the microstructural properties, it is possible to add multiple additives (including nano and microparticles) to mortars, without damaging its final quality. This work demonstrates that a higher additive content is not always a guarantee of better results; lower additions can often provide a better compromise between performance and final mechanical properties. The results presented in this paper confirmed this and show that combining PCM microcapsules and TiO2 nanoparticles open a new path in the development of mortars with multiple functionalities. In this study, a new material with depolluting, self-cleaning and heat storage was created. For the development of new and innovative mortars, a proper balance of multiple additives, supported by the study of microstructural changes, can lead to an optimization of the compositions, ensuring that the mortar's final properties are not affected.",2018
Application of life cycle assessment approach to deliver low carbon houses at regional level in Western Australia,Cleaner production strategies; Embodied energy; GHG emissions; Life cycle assessment,MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; THERMAL PERFORMANCE; SANDWICH PANELS; EMBODIED ENERGY; WALL SYSTEM; CONCRETE; ENVELOPE; BEHAVIOR,"Purpose Australian building sector contributes 23% of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is particularly important for Western Australia (WA) as the houses here are made of energy-and carbon-intensive clay bricks. This research has utilized life cycle assessment (LCA) approach and cleaner production strategies (CPS) to design low-carbon houses in 18 locations in regional WA. Methods An integrative LCA analysis of clay brick house has been conducted by incorporating energy efficiency rating tool (i.e., AccuRate) to capture the regional variation in thermal performance of houses in 18 locations in WA under five climatic zones. The data bank provided information on energy and materials for mining to material production, transportation of construction materials to the site of construction, and construction stages, while an energy rating tool has been utilized to generate location-specific information on energy consumption during use stage for developing a life cycle inventory for estimating life cycle GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption of a typical 4 x 2 x 2 detached house (i.e., 4 bed rooms, 2 bathrooms, and 2 cars/double garage). This approach has enabled us to determine the location-specific hotspot of a house in order to select suitable CPS for achieving reduced level of GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption. Results and discussion Except for two hottest locations, the average life cycle GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption of houses at 16 locations in regional WA have been estimated to be 469 t of CO2 equivalent (or CO2 e-) and 6.9 TJ, respectively. Home appliances and water heating have been found to be the top two hotspots. The CPS options, including rooftop solar photovoltaic panels (PV), solar water heaters (SWH) integrated with gas based water heaters, cast in situ concrete sandwich wall, fly ash as a partial replacement of cement in concrete, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) foam made of post-consumed polyethylene terephthalate bottles, have been considered to reduce GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption of a typical house in 18 locations in regional WA. Excluding above two hottest locations, these CPS provide an opportunity to reduce GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption per house by an average value of 320 t CO2 e-and 3.7 TJ, respectively. Conclusions Considering the alarming growth rate of the housing industry in WA, the incorporation of optimum house orientation, rooftop solar PV, roof top SWH, cast in situ sandwich wall, partial replacement of cement in concrete with fly ash, and PET foam insulation core could reduce the overall GHG emissions and embodied energy consumption associated with the construction and use of clay brick wall house which in turn will assist in achieving Australia's GHG emission reduction target by 2050. The findings provide useful data for architects, designers, developers, and policy makers to choose from these CPS options based on existing resource availability and cost constraints.",2018

To promote sustainability in the concrete industry, various kinds of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as fly ash, blast furnace slag and silica fume have been used to replace cement in concrete production. The nature of these SCMs has therefore been changed from wastes to co-products or by-products. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been increasingly adopted in the concrete industry to assess environmental sustainability. However, the choice of an appropriate method for impact distribution in the LCA of concrete incorporating SCMs is a research challenge. This study aimed to present a comprehensive review of the impact allocation approaches for assessing the environmental impacts of SCMs-incorporated concrete. Furthermore, the use of the system expansion approach was compared with the conventional mass and economic allocation approaches. A case study of concrete production using SCMs in Hong Kong was conducted using the different approaches. The results were then analyzed and it was concluded that the system expansion approach is appropriate for the assessment of the environmental impacts of SCMs-incorporated concrete.",2018

Recycling is considered an effective strategy to manage construction and demolition waste; however, the environmental costs and benefits of recycling, compared with a traditional landfill strategy, have not been fully investigated. This study uses a life cycle assessment and willingness-to-pay methodology to investigate the environmental impacts of recycling 1 tonne of demolition waste in Shenzhen. The environmental impacts are global warming, ozone depletion, acidification, eutrophication, suspended particulate matter, solid waste, and land consumption. The results show that recycling can bring an environmental benefit of sic 1.21 per tonne while direct landfill leads to an environmental cost of sic12.04 per tonne. The environmental costs and benefits of recycling concrete, brick, steel, and mortar, which are the most commonly seen types of component from demolition waste, are also investigated. The results can be used by regulatory authorities to establish strategies and policies, such as the provision of monetary incentives, in order to encourage recycling activities. The results can also be used to establish appropriate landfill charges. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Recycle option for metallurgical by-product (Spent Foundry Sand) in green concrete for sustainable construction,Green concrete; Spent Foundry Sand; Compressive strength; Permeability,,"Reuse of waste materials as construction material is very much essential to achieve sustainable construction. Utilization of waste materials as construction material not only help in protection of environment but also result in monetary savings. Spent Foundry Sand (SFS) is the waste material generated by metal casting industry. This paper presents study on economic and environmental benefits of recycling of SFS in concrete as sand replacement. Strength and durability properties of green concrete made with SFS as sand replacement are also presented. Natural sand in concrete was replaced with SFS at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% replacement levels by weight. To assess the performance of green concrete made with SFS, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, deicing salt resistance and chloride permeability tests were performed. At age of 28 days, green concrete mixtures containing SFS as sand replacement displayed up to 26% and 12.87% improvement in compressive strength and splitting tensile strength over that-of control concrete, respectively. Similarly, concrete mixtures made with SFS exhibited 7.2-17.7% lower chloride ion penetration and 6.6-26.42% improvement in salt scaling resistance on use of SFS. The green concrete mixtures showed very slight scaling after 50 cycles of freezing and thawing in the presence of deicing salt compared to slight to moderate scaling shown by control concrete. The incorporation of up to 20% SFS as sand replacement results improvement in strength and durability properties of green concrete over those of control concrete. Green concrete made with SFS is economical and reduces negative impact on environment by reducing CO2 emissions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018

Concrete samples prepared in the lab with and without the use of EMD waste were exposed to sulfate and chloride salt solutions. In particular, the test samples were placed in 5% w/w Na2SO4 solution, while chloride penetration resistance was studied in 3.5% w/w NaCI solution. The concrete mixtures were prepared with 0%, 5% and 10% w/w replacement of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) with the aforementioned waste additive. For testing, specimens of varying shapes and dimensions were cast; cylindrical reinforced cement mortar specimens were also prepared. Tests for estimating the physico-mechanical properties (compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, porosity and sorptivity), mass loss of steel and thermal response of concrete (DTA/TG) were performed; the carbonation depth of mortars exposed to atmospheric conditions was also estimated. The experimental results generally suggest that the EMD waste additive does not affect negatively the properties of concrete partially immersed in chloride salt solution; in addition, the anticorrosive effect of EMD waste on steel rebars embedded in cement mortars was also observed. On the other hand, the composite concretes immersed in sulfate salt solution exhibited inferior values for all measured properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Synthesis of nano cementitious additives from agricultural wastes for the production of sustainable concrete,Carbon nano-fibers (CNF); Carbon-neutral cement (CNC); Nano cementitious additives (NCA); Palm oil fuel ash (POFA); Rice husk ash (RHA); Sustainable concrete,OIL FUEL ASH; GEOPOLYMER CONCRETE; DURABILITY PERFORMANCES; SILICA; COMPOSITES,"The cement and concrete production industries are widely acknowledged as one of the major contributors of carbon dioxide in the modern world. Extensive research have been undertaken over the years to enhance the sustainability and resilience aspects of these industries, as well as to neutralize their carbon footprint. This study aims to utilize palm oil fuel ash (POFA) and rice husk ash (RHA) to produce nano cementitious additives (NCA) for carbon-neutral cement (CNC). The performance of NCA was evaluated in ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete by replacing the OPC at dosages of 0.5% and 1.0%. CNC with 100% supplementary materials was activated with 2.5 M NaOH concentration. The activated CNC was used to replace OPC from 0% to 100% in concrete, and their workability, pozzolanic reactivity, and early age and long-term compressive strength performances were analyzed. Subsequently, micro- and nano scaled fibers were introduced into the mix with 100% CNC to enhance the flexural and tensile characteristics of the composite. The findings indicated that low-dosage of NCA (0.5%) resulted in increased early-age strength, whereas NCA at 1.0% enhanced the early-age and ultimate strength of the concrete. The inclusion of micro- and nano-scaled fibers contributed in enhancing the flexural characteristics of the concrete matrix. It can be deduced that NCA is feasible to function as strength enhancer for OPC or as an activator to produce CNC, thus offering a novel sustainable construction material and contributing towards greener construction.

CHARACTERISTICS OF MELTS FROM HIGH-TEMPERATURE TESTS OF LOWER QUARTENARY LOAMS AND TECHNOGENIC COAL ASH FROM BORALDAY TPP AS THE BASIS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF LIGHT CONCRETE FILLERS,keramzit; charge; loess-like loam; coal ash; thermal; X-ray phase and microprobe analyzes; melting of batch of high-temperature furnace,,"The study describes of the material composition, technological properties of light concrete fillers (aggregates) from Lower Quaternary loam and coal ash waste from TPP. Huge amount of ash (many hundreds of millions tons) has accumulated on the territory of Kazakhstan, which is a waste product of coal power industry. Organization of light concrete fillers production from waste would allow manufacturing various building structures on their basis. Old and new ash burials from Boralday area contains up to 90% siliceous formations (mullite and quartz), which is characterized as a durable, fireproof and chemically stable substances. These natural formations are durableas part of the construction material. Due to the peculiarities of the mineral content of the formations under consideration, with negligible impurities of calcium and magnesium carbonates, they can be used directly as a filler of concrete. And with the additional firing of this ash, the lightness, heat and soundproofness of the concrete product will be added to the abovementioned qualities. When calcining loam, some of its components (montmorillonite, muscovite, and chlorite) together with non-melted quartz particles form a homogeneous aggregate. Minerals such as calcite, dolomite and gypsum degenerated into calcium and magnesium oxides during dissociation, which eventually allowed to reduce the viscosity of the melt. The main aggregates of the melt (similar to 50%) in the obtained firing product were powder granules of siliceous constituents of loam. Thus, the product obtained at this stage of the study can already be used in the production of heat-resistant and mechanically strong flake aggregates of light concrete aggregates.",2018

The Use of Coagulated Silica as Active Mineral Admixture in Cement-Based Fine Grained Mortars,,NANO-SILICA; FRESH PROPERTIES; BLENDED CEMENTS; CONCRETE; PASTE,"Active silica containing materials, in the form of finely particulate mineral admixtures, are widely used in cement and concrete industries helping to reduce the amount of cement binder input and thus to mitigate negative environmental impacts of cement production. In this connection, coagulated silica, possessing high pozzolanic activity may introduce a worthy material sort in cement blends production. In this paper, the possible use of commercially produced coagulated silica for preparation of fine-grained cement mortars is examined. Chemical and physical analysis of coagulated silica is performed first and the obtained data is compared with reference values measured for Portland cement. In mortars composition, coagulated silica is used as a substitute for Portland cement. The replacement ratio is 5-20 vol. %. The reference cement-based mortar mix is prepared and tested as well. The dosage of batch water is 0.5 and is maintained similar for all mortars mixes. Behaviour of fresh mortars is characterized by penetration time. For the hardened samples cured 28 days in water, bulk density, matrix density, and total open porosity are accessed. The contribution of coagulated silica to the mechanical resistance of the developed mortars is evaluated on the basis of flexural strength, compressive strength, and Young's modulus measurements. In addition, liquid water transport parameters and thermal properties of hardened samples are tested. Obtained results show gradual shortening of penetration time with increasing content of silica in mortar mix. On the other hand, the use of coagulated silica led to the decrease in the total open porosity and thus improved mechanical resistance of silica-enriched mortars compared to reference material. The effect of silica use on mortars liquid water transport properties is minimal, typically in the range of measuring uncertainty. The embedded air gaps in the coagulated clusters partially retarded heat transport in silica-cement- based hardened products, the highest decrease in thermal conductivity of approx. 23 % is observed for mortar with 15% cement replacement. Base on the performed experimental tests, the tested coagulated silica can be applied for improvement of specific properties of cement-based construction materials, considering its chemical and physical parameters.",2018
Thermal Properties of Lightweight Concrete with Scrap Tire Rubber-Based Aggregate,,BEHAVIOR,"Most of waste tires are landfill disposed, which is the most common method. This method will be drastically reduced in the near future due to the recent introduction of European Union directives that include significant restrictions on this practice in favor of alternatives oriented towards material and energy recovery. One of the possible solutions for the use of scrap tire rubber is to incorporate it into concrete, to replace some of the natural aggregate. This paper is aimed at the thermal performance of a lightweight concrete incorporating high volume of crushed waste tires as partial substitution of natural silica aggregate of the same grain size. In order to quantify the effect of waste tires-base aggregate on concrete properties, a reference concrete mix without waste rubber was studied as well. For the applied crushed waste tire rubber, bulk density, matrix density, and particle size distribution were measured. Specific attention was paid to thermal transport and storage properties of waste rubber that were examined in dependence on compaction time. For the developed lightweight concrete, thermal properties were accessed using transient impulse technique, whereas the measurement was done in dependence on moisture content, at the dry state and at the fully water saturated state. Additionally, the investigated thermal properties were plotted as function of porosity and density. Mechanical resistance was also tested. The tested lightweight concrete was found to be an alternative construction material possessing improved thermal insulation function and sufficient mechanical resistance. Furthermore, the environmental advantages caused by reusing used tires and consequently eliminating their disposal should also be taken into consideration.",2018
Trial to Determine Durability and Serviceability for Swine Farm in Thailand,,FLY-ASH; CONCRETE,"In agricultural construction, the most frequently used construction material is concrete. In particular swine farm, traditional concrete flooring system in the business is conventional concrete. However, the conventional concrete floor has several key issues on its surface. They are easily to be spalled and cracked, pig scour, rough areas, and low wear resistance of acid from animal feed. This research involves study in the ratio between Portland cement and supplementary materials (fly ash and silica fume) that is the most resistant to abrasion. Concrete samples were cured in water for 28 days, then submersed in lactic acid solution at 30 degrees C (pH 2-3). After exposure to the acid solution, every 7, 14, 28, and 56 days, the samples will be test for attrition on the face of concrete in accordance with ASTM C944 to simulate the acceleration reaction refer to animal behaviour and corrosion from acid of feed.

Engineered Bamboo's Further Application: An Empirical Study in China,,,"The trend of sustainable development has been followed more globally nowadays. There is an urgent need for ecological friendly construction materials in China since the use of concrete produces pollution and leads to inefficient use of energy. Bamboo can effectively address the sustainability trends due to: lightweight construction, little adverse impact on the environment, and anti-seismic properties. However, bamboo products utilization has been very limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility to further utilize bamboo products in the construction industry in China. A review of engineered bamboo products utilization in China, and oversees was conducted. Based on this, a survey focusing on the current situation and suitability of bamboo products was carried out to study their feasibility, and preliminary testing on bonding shear strength for different configurations are presented.

It is a necessity to preserve available resources and to keep the waste in control in order to achieve a sustainable development goal. In recent years, concepts of waste management, recycling and sustainability have gained importance with regards to the construction industry. Today, approximately 35 billion tons of concrete is produced worldwide and 80% of this amount consists of aggregated manufactured using natural resources. A significant environmental impact is the case even for the production of cement, a binding agent for concrete, which accounts for 1 ton CO2 emission in order to produce 1 ton of cement. The main subject of this study is the production of a sustainable construction material with the use of ceramic instead of both aggregate and cement. Clay is defined as a common natural material with fine-grains, with layers and a high water absorption capacity. Ceramic products are construction materials which can replace cement generally in the form of artificial puzzolana. The main subject of this study is the use of the waste obtained from ceramic plants which produces ceramic products in mortars. Taguchi L9 array design was used as part of this experimental study. Water-binder ratio was set to 0.50 in the preparation of the mixes and natural aggregates were used. Aggregates were then replaced by pieces ceramic and brick at a percentage between 20 and 60% while cement was replaced by ceramic and brick powder at a percentage between 10 and 30%. The mixes were then subjected to freeze and thaw tests at 30, 60 and 90 cycles in accordance with ASTM C 666 standard. Dynamic modulus and mechanical properties of the mortars subjected to f-t effect were then identified. When the results of the tests were examined, it was found that the compressive strength at 7th and 28th days were decreased with the increase of the volume of ceramic and brick powder used while it was found that the use of ceramic and brick powder did not have a significant effect on the compressive strength at the 90th day. The use of ceramic and brick aggregate led to favorable results in terms of freeze-thaw resistance. Especially the use of 10% ceramic [(whiteware) CA] and 20% other ceramic [(brick) BA] aggregate in mortars subjected to 90 f-t cycles increased the dynamic modulus while similar results were found for the use of 5% ceramic powder and 10% brick powder in mortars subjected to 90 days of f-t cycles. This study shows that waste material obtained from ceramic and bricks industry can be repurposed in the construction industry.",2018
Investigation of Buckling Behavior of FRP-Concrete Hybrid Columns,Buckling; GFRP; Concrete; RPC; Slenderness,COMPOSITES; BEAMS,"The use of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composite materials in the construction industry increases with each passing day. In recent years, these materials are used as carrier material or reinforcement material in the structure. Glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) profiles are among the most preferred FRP composite materials. GRFP profiles stand out with their high tensile strength, light weight and high corrosion performance. The hybrid use of these materials with classical construction materials offers new advantages. The buckling behavior of the hybrid material formed by placing concrete in plastic state into GFRP box profiles with high tensile strength was investigated in this study. The buckling performance of hybrid columns formed using GFRP profile, normal concrete or reactive powder concrete (RPC) was studied. To this end, normal concrete-GFRP profile and RPC-GFRP profile hybrid columns were produced and buckling testing was performed at different slenderness values. Charts were created after buckling experiments to examine differences in the behavior of the material. As a result of the examinations, the effect of RPC and column slenderness on the buckling performance hybrid columns was identified.",2018

Determination of Self-Healing Performance of Cementitious Composites Under Elevated CO2 Concentration by Resonant Frequency and Crack Opening Measurements,High CO2 environment; Cementitious composites; Self-healing,FLY-ASH; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CARBONATION; CONCRETE; HYDRATION; CEMENTS; ECC,"Global warming is a phenomenon that incontrovertibly affects daily lives of human beings in almost all aspects. Definitely, construction industry, especially concrete as most commonly used construction material, is not exempt from the effects of global warming. Nevertheless, there is a lack of information on how the change in atmospheric conditions influences self-healing behavior of cementitious materials. This research examines the impact of increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere on the self-healing capability of cementitious materials in terms of resonant frequency and crack opening measurements. For this purpose, to clearly disclose the effect of tremendous increase in the environmental CO2 concentration as a result of global warming, Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) which possess advanced intrinsic self-healing capability were employed. For this purpose, sound and pre-cracked ECC specimens containing fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag were tested by resonant frequency after 28 days of initial curing up to 28 + 90 days with 15 days intervals and crack openings were observed for each testing age. Moreover, in order to accelerate the capture of CO2 from the environment, a third ECC mixture was prepared by adding Ca(OH)(2) to the ECC mixture incorporating fly ash. The results showed that CO2 present in the environment can improve the self-healing behavior of ECC mixtures, which is a promising finding in terms of environmental concerns. Possibility of capturing and decreasing the CO2 from the atmosphere by self-healing mechanism will make the ECC a more environmentally friendly construction material additional to its superior technical properties.",2018

Results were compared with a reference concrete mix without plastic waste in order to quantify the effect of GFPP use on concrete properties. Main material physical parameters were studied (bulk density, matrix density without air content, and particle size distribution). Especially a thermal transport and storage properties of GFPP were examined in dependence on compaction time. For the developed lightweight concrete, thermal properties were accessed using transient impulse technique, where the measurement was done in dependence on moisture content (from the fully water saturated state to dry state).

An accurate low-cost Crackmeter with LoRaWAN communication and energy harvesting capability,Structural Health monitoring; SHM; Embedded platform; Distributed measurement; WSN; LoRa,DAMAGE IDENTIFICATION; SYSTEMS; MODELS,"Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are becoming increasingly widespread and are in some cases mandated by law. A major factor limiting the diffusion of such systems is the lack of low-cost low-power sensor nodes, which can be deployed in large numbers in hard-to-reach areas, while providing high-quality precise measurements over their entire lifespan with minimum maintenance and withstanding climatic stress. In this paper, we present a cost-effective wireless component for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) that measure and track cracks in concrete and other construction materials. The sensor combines a microprocessor with LoRaWAN wireless communication, an analog transducer, and a solar energy harvester, allowing long-term remote monitoring with easy plug and play installation. Experimental results demonstrate that we achieved about 1 mu m accuracy and an expected lifetime of more than 10 years, with stable measurements across a -15 - 65 degrees C temperature range.",2018
Graphene Oxide Admixed Aerated Concrete Composite with Carbon Fibres,aeration; pores; strength; permeability; density,ASH,"Concrete is the widely used construction material and research focus is towards customizing the mixture proportion to suit the application for various construction facilities. Advancement in construction industry has resulted in fast track construction facilities with the use of precast structural elements. Lightweight concrete is gaining importance due to the popularity of prefabricated construction. This paper highlights the optimized mixture proportion of aerated concrete composite with certain chemical and mineral admixtures so that it can be suitably used for precast structural elements. Aluminium powder was used as the aerating agent. Lime powder of about 30% by weight of cement was used to facilitate the aeration process. Lime reacts with aluminium powder liberating hydrogen gas which is responsible for the air voids in concrete. Fly ash class F was used as replacement for sand by 20%. The sand used for this concrete was pulverized and the fraction passing 1.18 mm sieve was used for the concrete. Since the mixture proportion is a multivariable process, statistically designed experiments using central composite design of response surface methodology was used to design the trial mixes. The significance of the interacting factors and the validity of experimentation were analyzed using ANOVA analysis. The strength properties and durability tests were performed to access the characteristics of the material. The density of the concrete was 1285 kg/m(3). The compressive strength obtained was 27.5 MPa, the tensile strength was 2.89 MPa and flexural strength was 3.4 MPa. Chopped carbon fibres and graphene oxide were admixed to the concrete and it was observed that there was 13% increase in the compressive strength when 0.05% of graphene oxide was added. Also carbon fibres increased the flexural strength of the concrete bridging the cracks that were formed when load was applied. Response surface graphs were drawn for all the characteristics that were studied. The significant interaction effects were assessed for all the observed characteristics. There is a general view that aerated concrete being a porous material will not be durable in terms of performance. Hence durability tests like carbonation test, concrete impermeability test and rapid chloride penetration tests were performed to access the durability of the material. It was observed that there were isolated pores and hence the durability of the concrete was the same as conventional concrete. Hence optimized mixture ratio was obtained for low density, high strength and low water permeability. This material can be potentially used for the fabrication of precast structural components so that the process of handling these members will be easy due to the reduced weight of the concrete. Also it has been reported that aerated concrete has good acoustical and thermal insulation properties. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2018
Using Waste Concretes as Recycling Aggregate in Concrete Production and Sustainability,Sustainable concrete; Waste concrete; Recycled aggregate; Compressive strength,,"Protecting natural sources is an important responsibility for the whole world. Concrete is the most widespread construction material, as a result of its production, natural sources are running out, and also natural environment is being disturbed. In addition, building wastes brought about by the renovation activities for the structures that have expired. In order to maintain the ecological balance, using the available sources wisely and efficiently is crucial. In this study, known class and age of waste concrete is used as coarse and fine aggregates as production of concrete. There are two types of aggregates are used in concrete production as 0-4 and 4-22.4 sizes. These aggregates groups are replaced with normal aggregates as 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100% ratios in concrete. Compressive strength of concrete specimens are determined as 28 and 90 days coring regime. According to the experimental results, it has been seen that recycled aggregates may be used in concrete production and that they may shed light in the production of sustainable concrete.",2018
Problems Encountered in the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Recycled Materials in Construction,Clay; Life cycle analysis; Stabilisation; Soil; Cementation; Sustainability,,"The establishment of sustainability credentials of emergent construction materials is very subjective, and most available tools such as BREEAM, CEQUAL, ARUP SpeAR among others are not fully quipped or equipped at all to deal with individual material systems. The main problem emanates from the challenges of the audit of each aspect of the material processing, and especially the quantification of the relevant transport, energy, environmental and other inputs into the composite product. Incorporation of materials with long and complex recycling processes further exacerbate the challenge. This paper reports on a simplified approach towards full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of seven clay-based brick products developed in UK and in Spain, based on known material data and estimated energy inputs in the manufacturing processes. In order to test the robustness of the proposed approach, results on UK-based bricks are compared with a parallel LCA on clay-based product developed in Spain. Finally, the clay-based products are compared with a typical Portland cement-based concrete block and fired clay brick. In the LCA, boundary conditions include fixed transport, thus attempting to factor only the (i) material ingredients, (ii) their known atmospheric emissions, and (iii) estimated energy inputs during processing. Results suggest that the most challenging aspect in the undertaking of LCA is the availability of reliable input data. Results also show that there are numerous parameters that can reliably and corroboratively facilitate the comparison of performance, besides carbon dioxide emissions.",2018
The Permeable Character of CSG Dams and Their Seepage Fields,,,"Current studies regarding the permeable properties, corrosion properties, and seepage characteristics of cemented sand and gravel (CSG) materials are based on laboratory tests. Thus, there is a lack of studies analyzing the permeable character of seepage fields based on monitoring data from real prototypes working under practical operating conditions. In this paper, on the basis of measured data from the Dahuaqiao cofferdam, we establish an inversion analysis method for unsteady seepage fields covering different time periods within a time sequence. The results indicate an effective dynamic change law for the material permeability coefficient and the real dynamic evolution characteristics of seepage fields. The permeability coefficient of CSG exhibits a ""self-healing"" phenomenon similar to concrete, with the seepage characteristics of a dam tending to become stable over time. Under the long-term action of water pressure, the seepage behavior of the dam body shows no obvious deterioration, suggesting that CSG can satisfy the required anticorrosion property expected of dam construction materials. Thus, abnormal CSG might serve as an effective antiseepage layer that can meet the running requirements of cofferdams. The results of this research can provide reference for further improvement in the CSG dam design theory.",2018
Tentative to use wastes from thermal power plants for construction building materials,,,"Thermal power plants (TPP) generates wastes (bottom and fly ashes) which become a serious environmental problem in Vietnam Indeed, although in several countries fly ash can be used for cement industry, fly ash from actual TPP in Vietnam does not have enough good quality for cement production, because the fly ash treatment phase has not yet included in the generations of existing Vietnamese TPP. That is why bottom ash and fly ash purely become wastes and their evacuation is an urgent demand of the society. This paper presents an investigation using fly and bottom ashes in the manufacturing of construction materials. The main aims of this study is to reduce environmental impacts of fly and bottom ashes, and to test another non-conventional binder to replace cement in the manufacture of unburnt bricks. Several proportions of fly ash, bottom ash, cement, gravel, sand and water were tested to manufacture concretes. Then, geopolymer was prepared from the fly ash and an activator. Specimens were tested in uniaxial compressions. Results showed that the cement concrete tested had the compressive strengths which could be used for low rise constructions and the material using geopolymer could be used for non-load-bearing materials (unburnt bricks).",2018
The effect of crack width on the service life of reinforced concrete structures,,,"Reinforced concrete has become a widely used construction material around the world. Nowadays, the assessment of deterioration and life expectancy of reinforced concrete structure is very important and necessary as concrete is a complex material with brittle failure. Under the effect of load and over time, cracks occur in the structure, significantly reducing its performance and durability. Therefore, a number of models for predicting the penetration of chloride ions into the concrete were proposed to assess the durability of the structure. In the study performed by T B Viet (2016) [1], the author proposed a new theoretical model, especially considering the effects of macro and micro cracking on the diffusion coefficient of chloride ion in the cracked concrete. The following experimental results, in term of electrical indication of concrete's ability to resist chloride ion penetration, are used to calculate the lifespan of a reinforced concrete structure according to Dura Crete approach [8] with different crack widths to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the above model in the range of concrete compressive strength of 30-70MPa.",2018
Effects of microbial agents to the properties of fly ash-based paste,,CALCIUM-CARBONATE PRECIPITATION; CONCRETE; BACTERIA,"Specific microbial agents such as bacteria are often used in concrete to improve its performance. Some microbes act as self-healing agents to close cracks in concrete, and to increase concrete strength. This paper presents a study to observe the effects of microbe addition to two types of concrete mixtures the fly ash-based, as geopolymer paste, and portland cement paste containing fly ash. Furthermore, the investigation was conducted to compare the properties of each paste, such as its compressive strengths, specific gravities, porosity, microstructures, and X-Ray diffracting properties. The results indicate that microbial activities positively affected the properties of both, portland cement paste and geopolymer paste.

Suitability Investigation of Recycled Concrete Aggregates for Concrete Production: An Experimental Case Study,,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; STRUCTURAL CONCRETE; DEMOLITION WASTES; FLY-ASH; CONSTRUCTION; DURABILITY; PERFORMANCE; BLOCKS; FIBER,"In developing countries, construction and demolition waste (CDW) is disposed to landfill, causing social, environmental, and economic crises. In these nations, CDW exponentially increase due to their rapid economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization. This paper aims to examine the possibility of recycling concrete waste for production of new concrete in Ethiopia. Physical and mechanical characteristics of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) acquired from concrete waste are thoroughly examined. Though the RCA exhibited relatively lesser performance compared with the natural coarse aggregate (NCA), it reveals the same properties as of normal-weight aggregates in several instances. The performance of concrete specimens which employ RCA up to 20% is evaluated from workability, strength, and permeability aspects. The utilization of RCA slightly affects the workability and the water permeability properties of the concretes. Replacement of 10% of the NCA by the RCA enhances the compressive strength of the hardened concrete by 8%. The difference between the splitting tensile strength of the concretes which employ RCA and conventional aggregates is trivial. Generally, this work demonstrates the practicability of concrete waste recycling to produce new concrete or construction materials in Ethiopian context.",2018
Application of mathematical model methods for optimization tasks in construction materials technology,,,"In this paper, the regression equations method for design of construction material was studied. Regression and polynomial equations representing the correlation between the studied parameters were proposed. The logic design and software interface of the regression equations method focused on parameter optimization to provide the energy saving effect at the stage of autoclave aerated concrete design considering the replacement of traditionally used quartz sand by coal mining by-product such as argillite. The mathematical model represented by a quadric polynomial for the design of experiment was obtained using calculated and experimental data. This allowed the estimation of relationship between the composition and final properties of the aerated concrete. The surface response graphically presented in a nomogram allowed the estimation of concrete properties in response to variation of composition within the x-space. The optimal range of argillite content was obtained leading to a reduction of raw materials demand, development of target plastic strength of aerated concrete as well as a reduction of curing time before autoclave treatment. Generally, this method allows the design of autoclave aerated concrete with required performance without additional resource and time costs.",2018

Application of ash and slag wastes in the production of building materials,,,"One of the most important problems of humanity nowadays is environmental pollution, which affects human health and life. There are nearly 50 million tons of emissions (ashslag wastes) realized in the environment per year, which indicates a physical contamination of nature and deterioration of the ecological situation on Earth. The processing and further use of emissions is a solution that can significantly reduce negative impact from industrial activity on the environment. The use of ash and slag emissions occupies one of the leading positions in this case. Recycled waste can considerably reduce the use of natural raw materials in constructi on industry. Ash-slag wastes, in contrast to natural ash, are not depleted, but on the contrary, their number increases every year, which in turn creates the prospects for their study and use. Replacement of material components with secondary waste will help to solve the problem of processing emissions, reduce the consumption of natural resources and contribute to introducti on of new construction materials based on ash and slag waste. The appearance of such product can solve the problem of shortage of building materials in some regions of Russia (Altai and Primorsky territory). The paper is concerned with the results of complex processing of ash-slag wastes, description of products received by adding the components of such wastes, spheres of application, analysis of obtained characteristics, and comparison of the new product with the concrete without components based on waste.",2018
Some aspects of using the crushed concrete under extreme conditions of the Russian Arctic,,,"The limited choice of construction materials under the extreme conditions of the Russian Arctic and the necessity to solve the ecological problems after the intense development of territories in the USSR raise the issue of utilizing the unnecessary dwelling and industrial buildings and using the obtained wastes.

From the view point of energy saving and over consumption of resources, the use of alternative constituents in construction materials is now a global concern. From this, the extensive research and development works towards exploring new ingredients are required for producing sustainable and environment friendly construction materials. Bagasse pulp liquor is one such material that can be used as a chemical admixture which is obtained as a by-product of paper manufacturing process. Around 5 million tons of bagasse pulp is obtained throughout the world each year. since the material is a waste product from paper industry, this can be changed as a admixture by its effective use in concrete. In the present investigation black pulp liquor is added to fresh concrete in different dosages, the concrete is then tested for workability, compressive strength, flexural, split tensile strength and setting time. From results it is shown that 1% replacement of water with black pulp liquor increases the fresh properties of the concrete, 2% replacement of water with black pulp liquor increases the mechanical properties of the concrete and acts as a set retarder.",2018
Utilization of fly ash and ultrafine GGBS for higher strength foam concrete,,,"Foam concrete is a widely accepted construction material, which is popular for diverse construction applications such as, thermal insulation in buildings, lightweight concrete blocks, ground stabilization, void filling etc. Currently, foam concrete is being used for structural applications with a density above 1800kg/m(3). This study focuses on evolving mix proportions for foam concrete with a material density in the range of 1200 kg/m(3) to 1600 kg/m(3), so as to obtain strength ranges that will be sufficient to adopt it as a structural material. Foam concrete is made lighter by adding pre-formed foam of a particular density to the mortar mix. The foaming agent used in this study is Sodium Lauryl Sulphate and in order to densify the foam generated, Sodium hydroxide solution at a normality of one is also added. In this study efforts are made to make it a sustainable construction material by incorporating industrial waste products such as ultrafine GGBS as partial replacement of cement and fly ash for replacement of fine aggregate. The fresh state and hardened state properties of foam concrete at varying proportions of cement, sand, water and additives are evaluated.

Studies on air void-strength relationship of foam concrete are also included in this paper.",2018
Effect of Alkaline Solution with Varying Mix Proportion on Geopolymer Mortar,Geopolymer; class; 'F' fly ash; Temperature; Strength; Alkalinity; Co-efficient of absorption,TEMPERATURE; STRENGTH; DURATION,"Cement production is attributed by emission of carbon dioxide which causes severe environmental impacts. This has led to the invention of special construction materials which can replace cement. On the other hand, these construction materials (like Fly ash, Metakaolin) also need to be inexpensive and should possess all the characteristics of cementitious materials. In this project, the effect of geopolymerization on the properties of the end product were studied with varying distillation of NaOH solution (10M, 12M and 15M) for different mix proportion (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3). Curing was done for 1 day at a temperature of 60 degrees C and 80 degrees C respectively. The densities, compressive strength, alkalinity, co-efficient of absorption were determined. As a result, the experiments showed the effect of factors such as mix proportion, curing temperature and curing day on the physical and mechanical properties such as mix proportion of the geopolymer concrete.

Industrial waste utilization for foam concrete,,SETTING BEHAVIOR,"Foam concrete is an emerging and useful construction material -basically a cement based slurry with at least 10% of mix volume as foam. The mix usually containing cement, filler (usually sand) and foam, have fresh densities ranging from 400kg/m(3) to 1600kg/m(3). One of the main drawbacks of foam concrete is the large consumption of fine sand as filler material. Usage of different solid industrial wastes as fillers in foam concrete can reduce the usage of fine river sand significantly and make the work economic and eco-friendly. This paper aims to investigate to what extent industrial wastes such as bottom ash and quarry dust can be utilized for making foam concrete. Foam generated using protein based agent was used for preparing and optimizing (fresh state properties). Investigation to find the influence of design density and air-void characteristics on the foam concrete strength shows higher strength for bottom ash mixes due to finer air void distribution.

Development of Neutron Shielding Concrete Containing Iron Content Materials,,,"Concrete is one of the most important construction materials which widely used as a neutron shielding. Neutron shield is obtained of interaction with matter depends on neutron energy and the density of the shielding material. Shielding properties of concrete could be improved by changing its composition and density. High density materials such as iron or high atomic number elements are added to concrete to increase the radiation resistance property. In this study, shielding properties of concrete were investigated by adding iron, FeB, Fe2B, stainless - steel at different ratios into concrete. Neutron dose distributions and shield design was obtained by using FLUKA Monte Carlo code.

Optical-Fiber-Based Smart Concrete Thermal Integrity Profiling: An Example of Concrete Shaft,,CONDUCTIVITY; RELIABILITY; MODEL,"Concrete is currently the most widely used construction material in the world. The integrity of concrete during the pouring process could greatly affect its engineering performance. Taking advantage of heat production during the concrete curing process, we propose an optical-fiber-based thermal integrity profiling (TIP) method which can provide a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the integrity of concrete immediately after its pouring. In this paper, we use concrete shaft as an example to conduct TIP by using the optical fiber as a temperature sensor which can obtain high spatial resolution temperature data. Our method is compared with current thermal infrared probe or embedded thermal sensor-based TIP for the concrete shaft. This innovation makes it possible to detect defects inside of the concrete shaft with thorough details, including size and location. First, we establish a 3D shaft model to simulate temperature distribution of concrete shaft. Then, we extract temperature distribution data at the location where the optical fiber would be installed. Based on the temperature distribution data, we reconstruct a 3D model of the concrete shaft. Evaluation of the concrete integrity and the existence of the potential defect are shown in the paper. Overall, the optical-fiber-based TIP method shows a better determination of defect location and size.",2018
Feasibility Study of Bangladeshi Electric Arc Furnace Steel Slag as an Alternative for Conventional Fine Aggregate,,,"This study was conducted to explore the possibility of utilization of Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) slag produced in Bangladesh as fine aggregate in concrete blocks. Arc Furnace slag was collected from a steel plant in Chittagong.

Stainless Steel Microfibers for Strain-Sensing Smart Clay Bricks,,CONCRETE; DAMAGE,"Life cycle monitoring of structural health of civil constructions is crucial to guarantee users' safety. An optimal structural health monitoring system allows to automatically detect, locate, and quantify any damage in structural elements, thus anticipating major risks of local or global failures. Critical issues affecting traditional monitoring systems are sensors' placement, hardware durability, and long-term reliability of the measurements. Indeed, sensors' deployment is crucial for an effective investigation of the static and dynamic characteristics of the structural system, whereby durability and long-term stability of sensing systems are necessary for long-term monitoring. A very attractive solution to some of these challenges is developing sensors made of the same, or similar, material of the structure being monitored, allowing a spatially distributed and long-term reliable monitoring system, by the use of self-sensing construction materials. Within this context, the authors have recently proposed new ""smart clay bricks"" that are strain-sensing clay bricks aimed at embedding intelligent monitoring capabilities within structural masonry buildings. While previous work focused on smart bricks doped with titanium dioxide and using embedded point electrodes, this work proposes an enhanced version of smart bricks based on the addition of conductive micro stainless steel fibers that possess higher electrical conductivity and a more suitable fiber-like aspect ratio for the intended application, as well as plate copper electrodes deployed on top and bottom surfaces of the bricks. The paper thus presents preparation and experimental characterization of the new smart bricks. The influence of different amounts of fibers is investigated, allowing the identification of their optimal content to maximize the gauge factor of the bricks. Both electrical and electromechanical experimental tests were performed. Overall, the presented results demonstrate that the new smart bricks proposed in this paper possess enhanced strain-sensing capabilities and could be effectively utilized as sensors within structural masonry buildings.",2018

On Longevity of Solid Construction Materials,solid material; breakage; longevity; creep of material; carbonization; calculation of longevity; statistical characterristics,,"Reliable forecasting of longevity for solid construction materials, especially for concrete and reinforced concrete is considered as a rather complicated scientific and technical problem which is often described in a great number of research papers. However this problem does not have a reliable analytical solution with the required statistical realization level. The paper contains a brief analysis of modern views pertaining to breakage processes in solid construction materials including concrete and reinforced concrete due to action of force (in particular, on the basis of temporary strength dependence with a static load) and non-force factors comprising as well carbonization and decrease of hydrogen index. Peculiar features concerning strength decrease of construction materials in time due to action of creep processes (plasticity) have been described in the paper. The paper presents two variants for assessment of possible longevity: without initial damage and with available initial defects. According to the first variant distribution of the test specimens of material for longevity corresponds to a lognormal law and in the second variant the distribution follows more complicated law. The paper provides levels of carbonization indices and a hydrogen index when corrosion of steel reinforcement does not occur. The following necessity has been established that is recommended to take into account not only characteristics and specific features in structure of solid construction materials in their strength theory but also statistical regularities because the breakage process represents in itself an integral phenomenon and due to this the final result can change according to random values of available structural defects, test errors and other factors. In this connection probability of their possible combinations has been described with the help of statistical laws. It has been shown that it is desirable to pay due consideration to maximum number of similar factors in order to increase a reliability of probabilistic-statistical methods for calculation of longevity.",2018
Life Cycle Assessment applied to circular designed construction materials,circular economy; construction and demolition waste; Life Cycle Assessment,,"Following the Waste Framework Directive, new solutions must be identified for the management of Construction and Demolition waste. Circular economy would provide the strategic key for addressing this issue: construction industry may, in fact, become an elective consumer of its own waste, where construction materials are circular and eco-designed. A comprehensive case study has been built, starting from evaluation of different management options for this waste to be applied in the municipality of Bologna and prosecuting with the design of concrete mixes, implementing construction and demolition derived aggregates as partial replacement for natural aggregates. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been applied to evaluate the environmental impact of the options designed, in comparison with standard concrete already on the market. In particular, 25% replacement of natural aggregates leads to almost equal decrease in respiratory inorganics related impact and more than 39% decrease in land occupation indicator, even though ozone layer depletion impact indicator shows a negative performance. Nevertheless, partial aggregates replacement should be coupled by a limited cement replacement, in order to trigger a substantial decrease of the environmental impact in concrete production.

Impacts of booming concrete production on water resources worldwide,,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CEMENT PRODUCTION; CLIMATE; LCA,"Concrete is the most-used construction material worldwide. Previous studies on the environmental impacts of concrete production have mainly focused on the materials involved and energy consumption, as well as CO2 emissions; little is known, however, about its water consumption as well as the effective measures to reduce such consumption. We quantify water use of global concrete production in 2012 and project the value to 2050. The results show that concrete production was responsible for 9% of global industrial water withdrawals in 2012 (this is approximately 1.7% of total global water withdrawal). In 2050, 75% of the water demand for concrete production will likely occur in regions that are expected to experience water stress. Among possible ways of mitigating water demand are choosing the appropriate selection of electricity fuel mixes and improved processing of raw materials; however, these strategies may conflict with greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. This work develops a baseline estimate for water consumption and withdrawal for concrete production and identifies locations for targeted mitigation.",2018

The compressive strength of concrete containing 0.4% polypropylene fibre at 28 days has the highest value of 32.22N/mm(2) as compared to 30.22N/mm(2), 30.49N/mm(2) and 30.39N/mm(2) for 0%, 0.2%, and 0.6% respectively. The splitting tensile strength at 7 days increases from 6.176 N/mm(2) to 8.386 N/mm(2) as the percentage of fibre increases from 0% to 0.4%.",2018
"Structural, Acoustic, and Aesthetic Performances of Double Layer Wall Made of Oyster Shell and Polymer as Green Material in Green Construction",,,"The aim of research was to introduce green material for construction project by using waste material made of oyster shell and polymer as a substitute material to reduce the use of cement. In this research, the use of cement was replaced by oyster shell powder and mortar that was injected with polyurethane to lighten the weight on the structure. The methods used to find out the structure performance was DOE method based on the standards of ASTM 109/ C 109M - 08 as well as the modulus of elasticity test. Acoustic test was also conducted with the standard test based on ASTM E 2611-09 and ASTM E 413. The aesthetic approach was conducted by an establishment of a model that represented the concept of double layer in the wall of the building. The results of this study proved that poly-urethane injection on mortar could decrease the weight of mortar by 20%. The absorption coefficient of polymer concrete was 0.9 - 1.00 at the frequency of 1500 - 2500 Hz and the Sound Transmission Loss (STL) of material was above 51 dB. Innovation of double layer building materials can be enriched by additional materials, such as natural fiber composite and fiber reinforced polymer. Aesthetically, the double layer wall material made of shells and polymer have a positive prospect to be used as construction material and can be applied in the architectural sphere as an aesthetic component of building, such as wall panel, wall ornament, double skin facade, and acoustical wall treatment.",2018
Application of nanomaterials to enhance microstructure and mechanical properties of concrete,Nanomaterials; green concrete; carbon nanotubes,PARTICLES,"The advances of sustainable construction and the green building movement of the past decade have encouraged comprehensive assessment of building materials and construction practices worldwide. With superior fire resistance, strength, and a long service life, concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. Considering the amount of concrete required for various construction works, enhancing sustainability to concrete, both in terms of concrete production and mix design would be a highly desirable prospect. Lately, nanotechnology is a promising field in terms of environmental improvements including energy savings and reduced reliance on non-renewable resources, as well as reduced waste, toxicity and carbon emissions. Nanotechnology allows enhancement of available concrete products by using nano-materials; these nano-materials could be in the form of nano-particles, nano-chemical additives, and nano-fibers in cement-based materials matrix. The usage of nanomaterials results in production of concrete with lower volume of cement. The influence of addition of various nano particles such as nano silica, nano Al2O3, nano TiO2, nano Fe2O3, nano clays, and highly dispersed carbon nano tubes in concrete is thoroughly investigated in present work with an initiative towards 'Green Concrete' incorporating these waste materials as one of its ingredients.",2018
Overview on the Utilization of Quarry Dust as a Replacement Material in Construction Industry,Sand replacement; strength; workability; waste management; environmental problem,CONCRETE; STRENGTH,"In line with economic development of the country, demand of raw materials for the construction, building and manufacturing sectors are also increasing. Concrete is a great significance that contributes to every construction practices. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world because of its ability to get cast in any form and shape. The strength and durability of concrete can be changed by utilizing suitable improvements in its ingredients such as cementitious material, aggregates and water. One of the raw materials used to produce conventional concrete is river sand which has significantly become very costly and becoming scarce due to river bed depletion therefore alternative material is in need. On the other hand, the growth of human population has led to concerns in solid waste management prior to major environmental problems that arose due to urbanization and industrial activities thus lead to its utilization in building material. There are different types of waste materials being used in the construction industry such as stone quarry dust, fly ash, rice husk, clay brick, metakaolins, palm oil fuel ash, bamboo leaf ash, volcanic ash, ground nut husk ash, waste glass, slurry glass powder, quarry dust and marble dust powder. Nevertheless, this paper only reviews on quarry dust as sand replacement in construction industry.",2018
Experimental and Numerical Study on the Compression Behavior of Square Concrete-Filled Steel Tube Stub Columns with Steel Fiber-Reinforced High-Strength Concrete,,STRESS-STRAIN BEHAVIOR; COMPOSITE COLUMNS; BEAM-COLUMNS,"This study was conducted to evaluate the applicability of concrete-filled steel tube (CFT) columns made from high-performance construction materials. KBC2016, South Korea's current building code, limits the maximum compressive strength of concrete at 70 MPa and the maximum yield strength of steel at 650 MPa. Similar restrictions to material properties are imposed on major composite structural design parameters in other countries worldwide. With the recent acceleration of the pace of development in the field of material technology, the compressive strength of commercial concrete has been greatly improved and the problem of low tensile strength, known to be the major limitation of concrete, is being successfully addressed by adding fiber reinforcement to concrete. Therefore, the focus of this study was to experimentally determine the strength and ductility enhancement effects, which depend on material composition. To this end, we performed concentric axial loading tests on CFT stub columns made from steel with a yield strength of 800 MPa and steel fiber-reinforced high-strength concrete. By measuring the strain at the yield point of CFT steel during the test, we could determine whether steel yields earlier than ultimate failure load of the member, which is a key design concept of composite structures. The analysis results revealed that the yield point of steel preceded that of concrete on the stress-strain curve by the concurrent action of the strain increase at the maximum strength, attributable to the high compressive strength and steel fiber reinforcement, and the strain increase induced by the confining stress of the steel tube. Additionally, we performed parametric study using ABAQUS to establish the broad applications of CFT using high-performance materials, with the width-to-thickness ratio as the main parameter. Parametric study was undertaken as experimental investigation was not feasible, and we reviewed the criteria for limiting the width-to-thickness ratio as specified in the current building code.",2018
FATIGUE PERFORMANCE OF SELF-CONSOLIDATING CONCRETE UNDER FLEXURAL LOAD,self-consolidating concrete; fatigue; flexural load; stress level,FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE; COMPACTING CONCRETE; PLAIN; BEHAVIOR,"As an advanced construction material, self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is a highly flowable concrete that is able to fill the formwork under its own weight without vibration. This paper presents a study on fatigue performance of SCC under flexural load. An experimental program has been carried out to investigate the fatigue lives of SCC for various levels of the fatigue stress. The fatigue tests on SCC beam specimens (100 x 100 x 400 mm) were conducted. The fatigue test data of SCC is used for regression analysis. The results indicate that the flexural fatigue life distribution of SCC approximately follow the double-parameter Weibull distribution. The regression parameters of the fatigue equation corresponding to different survival probabilities have been obtained. The flexural fatigue strength of SCC for the desired level of survival probability can be estimated by using the fatigue equation.",2018
Multi-functional Concretes for Structural Wall Elements,foamed concrete; microstructure; strucural test; multi-functional concrete,,"Due to the increasingly stringent specifications based on global energy saving regulations [ 4], structural construction, which initially only had mechanical functions, by now also have to have insulation features. An established standard solution are wall elements with heat insulation network systems attached to the supporting system. These heat insulation network systems usually consist of several layers of diverse material groups, mostly prepared of expanded, heat-insulating polystyrene foam (EPS). This construction is both expensive and energy consuming and makes a sorted recycling after removal almost impossible, requiring dumping in almost all cases. Another conventional construction material with good heat insulation characteristics is aerated concrete, which however has to be autoclaved with a high energy input. Commercially available, physically or mechanically foamed concretes are seldom used due to their low compressive strength and fluctuating characteristics. An alternative for the construction of both supporting and heat-insulating walls is the combination of chemically foamed, air-hardening, mineral-bound foam (CAMF) and ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). CAMF has been structurally optimized towards having good heat insulation characteristics and, due to its stability, can at the same time take the load transfer of the wall elements. The UHPC is attached as a shell to protect the CAMF and can additionally be used as a designed or functionalized surface. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Some Specific Features of Resource Saving in Construction,resource saving; price; high-performance concrete; tube concrete; tube; deformation characteristics; damping device; maximum safe load,,The Republic of Belarus possesses a limited number of important natural resources and their conservation is considered as one of the strategic directions for the development of construction industry. Regularities in resource saving can be used not only for cost-cutting at the expense of cheaper materials with worse properties but they can also be used under certain specific conditions for price formation through selection of expensive qualitative construction materials and products. Thus an analysis of changes in concrete price due to higher compressive strength has shown that the price per one concrete cubic metre is increasing much more slowly than an increase in strength. For this reason high-performance concrete is more advantageous in comparison with low- and medium-strength concrete. New comparative units for strength and other physical properties have been proposed for assessment of resource efficiency: unit price (in case of being used) and cost price (in case of being manufactured) make it possible to compare various materials and products and such approach is necessary while using steel tube confined concrete (STCC) structures in construction. Estimates suggest that high-strength concrete and tubes with minimum thickness of walls withstanding lateral pressure of a core which is deformed under load must be applied for STCC structures under normal operational conditions. In this context it is necessary to use damping devices for compensation of difference in characteristics of concrete and tube material and these devices ensure maximum safe load of concrete core and tube material.,2018
Valorisation of GRP Dust Waste in Fired Clay Bricks,,SUSTAINABLE CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL; CEMENTITIOUS MORTARS; HARDENED PROPERTIES; ADDING WASTES; PLASTIC WASTE; LOW DOSAGES; GFRP WASTE; FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; GLASS,"In Europe, the total amount of Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) waste is increasing. In order to valorise GRP dust (GRPd) waste and to reduce the consumption of nonrenewable resources in building materials, GRPd has been already investigated in cementitious materials where it gives even an improvement in some performances of the final products. Valorisation of GRPd waste in the production of bricks can be considered as a further alternative. In this paper, GRPd waste was substituted to the clay volume at 5% and 10% for the manufacturing of fired clay bricks. All specimens were subjected to a firing temperature of 850 degrees C for 6 hours, then tested and compared in terms of porosity, compressive and flexural strengths, density, and water absorption. Despite a decrease in compressive strength up to 46% with 10% of GRPd substitution and an increase of water absorption from 14% to 29% with 5% and 10% of GRPd substitution, respectively, an increase in terms oflightness (about 10%), maximum flexural strength (up to 31%), and deflections at the maximum load (up to 130%) has been registered by specimens with 10% of GRPd substitution.",2018
Evaluation of Reinforced Concrete Structures Using the Electromagnetic Method,,,"Reinforced concrete has been a universally dominant construction material for over a century, although structures made of this material are often exposed to many types of damage and deterioration due to different causes and external conditions. The most important problem is corrosion of the reinforcement. Currently, most of the inspection methods of rebar in concrete are of an indirect nature or they are partially destructive. Moreover, none of the well-known systems allow for direct and non-destructive evaluation of the rebar corrosion. The purpose of this paper is to present the new, direct and non-destructive method, which allows detection of cracks and corrosion of the reinforcement bars.",2018

Self-curing concrete with different self-curing agents,,,"Concrete is recognised as a versatile construction material globally. Properties of concrete depend upon, to a greater extent, the hydration of cement and microstructure of hydrated cement. Congenial atmosphere would aid the hydration of cement and hence curing of concrete becomes essential, till a major portion of the hydration process is completed. But in areas of water inadequacy and concreting works at considerable heights, curing is problematic. Self-Curing or Internal Curing technique overcomes these problems. It supplies redundant moisture, for more than sufficient hydration of cement and diminish self-desiccation. Self-Curing agents substantially help in the conservation of water in concrete, by bringing down the evaporation during the hydration of Concrete. The present study focuses on the impact of self-curing agents such as Poly Ethylene Glycol (PEG), Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) and Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) on the concrete mix of M25 grade (reference mix). The effect of these agents on strength properties of Concrete such as compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength was observed on a comparative basis which revealed that PEG 4000 was the most effective among all the agents.",2018
EVALUATION OF VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION OF SPECIES EMPLOYED IN EARTHWORK STABILIZATION WITH SOIL BIOENGINEERING TECHNIQUES,soil bioengineering; ecological restoration; river and stream management,,"Soil bioengineering techniques use live construction materials like plants and live cuttings as well as inert materials as structural elements in simple constructions, with the purpose of ecological restoration and soil stabilization. The inert materials used depend on the aims and the local availability, are essentially metal structures, geotextiles, timber, stones or even concrete. These, in addition to provide immediate soil stabilization also supply protection and support for the further development of the vegetation. The vegetative part complements, gradually or entirely, replaces the functions of stabilizing inert components. However, construction works, can only be performed successfully when the vegetation technical characteristics are known and, thus, properly exploited. This research is the result of a sequence of experiments performed with the goal of identifying, among riparian inhabit species, those with vegetative propagation capacity and development. A large part of soil bioengineering models use exclusively that way of propagation. Among the many potentially influential factors in vegetative development, such as survival, rooting and sprouting rate, growth roots and shoots velocity, should be also highlighted, the importance of collecting and planting time for vegetation. Therefore, this study, using experimental plots built in different times of the year, seeks to obtain this information by assessing the survival rate, shoots and roots development using cuttings of six potential species easily found along stream banks in southern Brazil rivers. The tested species are: Calliandra brevipes, Phyllanthus sellowianus, Pouteria salicifolia, Salix humboldtiana, Salix x rubens and Sebastiania schottiana. The experimental results indicate the possibility of using some of these species. Calliandra brevipes, Sebastiania schottiana and Pouteria salicifolia presented lower development than Phyllanthus sellowianus, Salix humboldtiana and Salix x rubens. It was evidenced that the planting season, is less important in species with fast rooting, as Phyllanthus sellowianus, Salix humboldtiana and Salix x rubens, but can be decisive in species with slower rooting, such as Sebastiania schottiana, and can even have an effect on the survival rate of these species.",2018

In Jilin province, China, abundant oil shale resources are mainly used for retorting shale oil accompanying with a large number of oil shale semicoke slags, which will generally cause environmental pollution and disposal problems. If oil shale semicoke can be utilized as a road base or subbase course construction material, it will be a great help to the disposal of a long-term accumulated oil shale semicoke in landfill sites. Moreover, the resource treatment of oil shale semicoke in road project construction could obtain positive social and economic benefits. Subsequently, we conducted a series of laboratory tests to study the practicability of cement-stabilized oil shale semicoke as a road base or subbase course construction material, including the raw material test, modified compaction test, unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test, splitting tensile strength (STS) test, compressive resilient modulus (CRM) test, and freezing-thawing test.

Mine blast vibration response spectrum for structural vulnerability assessment: case study of heritage masonry buildings,blast vibration; coal mine; design response spectrum; heritage building; structural vulnerability,REINFORCED-CONCRETE COLUMNS,"Ground-borne vibrations induced by mine blasting are typically of low amplitudes, which are not considered a major concern for modern engineered structures. However, historic structures are often considered more vulnerable due to inadequate knowledge regarding the state of construction materials and structural response. Specifically, the construction materials used might be fragile or have deteriorated to a stage that could be vulnerable to such vibrations. Simplistic rule based on peak ground motion parameter has been adopted worldwide for safety assessment, while the frequency characteristics of vibrations are not taken into account. Further, there is very limited study on response of heritage structures to near-field blasting. This article presents a practical structural vulnerability assessment method for mine blast-induced vibrations. In particular, a design response spectrum model is proposed based on close range measurements of nearby mine blasting, which is compared with an existing design spectrum model for far-field mine blasts and a typical design spectrum model for earthquake actions. The method is illustrated through a case study of heritage masonry buildings in Australia. The unique blast data presented and the generalized methodology would be useful to both structural engineers and blast engineers in considering potential effects of blasting on heritage structures.",2018
Characterization of LC sensor structures realized by PCB and LTCC technology for determining moisture in building materials,LC sensor; nanoindenter; 3D profile; moisture,CONCRETE STRUCTURES; WATER-CONTENT; WIRELESS; SYSTEMS; STONES,"This paper compares performances of two wireless sensors for measuring water concentration in building materials, one manufactured by the printed circuit board (PCB) technology and another one using the low temperature co-fired ceramics (LTCC) process.

The 28-day compressive strength of the BFS-DS binder was found to be about 30% that of ordinary Portland cement (OPC), but the 28-day strength of a binder made from BFS, DS, and anhydrous gypsum (G) was found to be similar to that of OPC. It is confirmed that BFS-DS-G binders have very low hydration heat, which is of use in reducing the heat generated during the curing of mass concrete. The main hydration product of the BFS-DS-G binder is found to be ettringite. Scanning electron microscope images reveal that the needle-shaped ettringite formed in the BFS-DS-G binder is much thicker than that formed in OPC. This thick, needle-shaped ettringite forms a skeletal structure, providing structural stability, and fills the gaps between hydration products such as calcium silicate hydrates and calcium aluminum hydrates, making it highly effective in forming a dense structure. The widespread use of BFS-DS-G binders would result in the value-added utilization of byproducts from the iron & steel making process, and provide an environmentally friendly and more economical construction material, and contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions generated by the cement industry.",2018

The foamed geopolymers are a mixture of aluminosilicate material obtained from Ecuadorian natural zeolite, group of alkaline activators and the foamed agent that when mixing the raw materials and obtain the geopolymer. To assess the potential use of foamed geopolymers as construction material, the annual energy demand for a social interest dwelling was obtained through simulation with EnergyPlus.

The crystallization, surface morphology, geopolymerization, interface analysis, and mechanical properties were characterized. The results indicated that the curing time exerted positive effects on the mechanical strength of the FWGCs. Noticeably distinct microstructures and mechanical properties were observed with different WF contents. The FWGCs with low WF loading (1 wt% and 5 wt%) presented almost unchanged or even improved mechanical properties compared to the pure FA-based geopolymer due to the existence of bonds between the WF and geopolymer matrix in the interface. However, the addition of WF to a higher content (10 wt%, 15 wt%, and 20 wt%) posted a negative influence on mechanical properties with insufficient polymerization of geopolymer and degradation of WF detected by morphology and elemental microanalysis. This study will facilitate a better understanding of the interaction between geopolymers and wooden materials, and serve as a basis for further research and applications.",2018
A New Nomogram Proposal to Determine Concrete Compressive Strength by Combined Nondestructive Testing Methods,Compressive strength; nondestructive testing; Schmidt hammer; Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV),,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material in contemporary construction technology. In particular, it holds an important place in the building industry in the world. Since concrete is a nonhomogeneous material, determining the strength of concrete accurately is quite difficult. In this respect, to check the mechanical properties of concrete in-situ, non-destructive test (NDT) methods can be used. They are useful as they do not damage concrete; however, these test results are sometimes deceptive. To reduce these deceptive results, destructive test methods were proposed to increase the accuracy of nondestructive methods. The objective of this study is to determine the strength of concrete with different characteristic strengths using destructive and NDT methods, and to establish new relationships between the compressive strength of concrete and Schmidt rebound values, and ultrasonic wave velocities. For this purpose, 101 concrete cube samples were prepared. After 7 and 28 days of curing, Schmidt rebound and ultrasonic wave velocity tests were applied as NDT methods. New formulations and graphs were established by carrying out a multiple regression analysis between the ultrasonic wave velocities, Schmidt rebound values, and compressive strengths. Thus, a new combined NDT method was developed with a nomogram. Furthermore, the applicability and accuracy of the formula and graph obtained were investigated by comparing the results of core samples from existing structures. The most important findings obtained from the study are summarized below. The concrete strength can be determined with nondestructive formulas obtained with an accuracy of 85%. High strength concrete cube samples are obtained in-house with 1.6% deviation, and core samples in-situ can be obtained with 7.3% deviation with the newly developed NDT nomogram. These test results show that the newly developed NDT formulas in this study are a very good alternative for determining concrete strength in-situ.",2018

At this size range, nanomaterial exhibits superior chemical and physical characteristics as compared to those displayed while existing in normal size. To date, multiple nanotechnology research centers within the United States are investigating the potential use of different types of nanoparticles as titanium dioxide (TiO2) in the construction industry to attain superior characteristics of building materials, improve their rating as environmentally friendly material, and improve the overall LEED rating of construction projects.The major impediments to the widespread implementation of nanotechnology include high nanomaterial cost, lack of industrial experience, and absence of standard specifications for building materials incorporating nanoparticles. This research article presents a research effort performed to improve the ability of construction material to attain self-cleaning properties through the incorporation of TiO2 particles in the concrete surface layers. Nanosized TiO2 particles were able to dissolve induced stains in the presence of sunlight. This chemical reaction, known as photocatalysis, can be successfully used in improving the environmental compliance of construction projects at the US market.",2018
Investigating Abrasion Resistance of Interlocking Blocks Incorporating Steel Slag Aggregate,abrasion resistance; ASTM C936; paver block; slag aggregate,CONCRETE,"This paper aims to introduce steel slag as a green construction material. The object of the study is to investigate the possibility and effect of replacing natural coarse aggregate in concrete paving block with electrical arc furnace slag (EAFS) to enhance its properties. The effect of different mixing ratios of EAFS on abrasion resistance, compressive strength, and water absorption were evaluated. It is observed that all the mixtures achieved most of the required ASTM C936 limits. The abrasion resistance and compressive strength of the slag-based mixtures showed higher values compared to the control mixture with conventional limestone aggregate. However, the abrasion requirement for interlocking concrete pavers is debated in the light of ASTM C936 standards. A suggested adaptation of the standard specification for solid concrete interlocking paving units, ASTM C936, is argued to consider macrotexture characteristics of the paver surface-ASTM E965 or ASTM E2157-as one of the paving requirements.",2018
Behavior of Concrete and Mortar in Response to the Inclusion of Toxic Jatropha Seed Cake,Concrete; Sustainability; Toxic material recycling,,"As the world's leading civil construction materials, concrete and mortar are the focus of ongoing studies aimed at improving their properties. These materials are highly versatile; hence, some of their aspects, such as their interaction with toxic materials, should be examined in greater depth. An investigation was therefore undertaken to ascertain how these products react to phorbol ester (PE), a toxin found in Jatropha seed cake (JSC). The mechanical behavior of mortar and concrete containing JSC waste from the manufacture of biofuel was examined based on the analysis of axial compressive strength. The interaction between mortar and PE molecules was examined by means of high performance liquid chromatography. A study of the mechanical behavior of the materials indicated that the inclusion of JSC greatly reduced their mechanical properties, and that this inclusion had a stronger impact on mortar than on concrete, while liquid chromatography showed that the toxic material inserted into the mortar remained inert, indicating the promising potential of this material to store toxic products.",2018
GROUND-BORNE NOISE AND VIBRATION TRANSMITTED FROM SUBWAY NETWORKS TO MULTI-STOREY REINFORCED CONCRETE BUILDINGS,ground-borne noise; vibration; subway; rail transit; multi-story buildings; reinforced concrete,PREDICTION; VEHICLE; HERITAGE; TRACK,"During the operation of urban subway rail transit systems, vibrations are generated that transmitted through the soil, induce vibrations in nearby buildings. The transmission of ground-borne vibrations from subway rail transit systems in a building is governed by the soil-foundation interaction, the reduction of vibration level between floors, and the amplification due to resonances of building elements. These are influenced by the type of the building, its construction materials, the foundation soil, and the frequency content of the excitation. A methodology is proposed for the determination of the sound vibration along the height of the building for a specific construction type, demonstrating how the attenuation and amplification parameters can be calculated. For this particular building type, a notable amplification of the vibration due to floor and other structural resonances was found, whereas the vibration and hence the radiated noise levels are similar from the first floor up. An overall building amplification factor is proposed, taking into account all the above mentioned transmission mechanisms.",2018
Oil palm shell as an agricultural solid waste in artificial lightweight aggregate concrete,lightweight concrete; oil palm shell; expanded clay; mechanical properties; green concrete,DIFFERENT CURING CONDITIONS; BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SILICA FUME; KERNEL SHELL; FLY-ASH; STRENGTH; PERFORMANCE; ADMIXTURES; BEHAVIOR,"The aim of this study was to produce a sustainable construction material by incorporating an agricultural solid waste, namely oil palm shell (OPS), in an artificial lightweight aggregate concrete. For this purpose, in a structural lightweight aggregate concrete made of expanded clay, the lightweight aggregate was substituted with OPS in 0, 25 and 50% by volume. Properties such as compressive strength under different curing conditions, as well as density, splitting tensile and flexural strengths, modulus of elasticity and drying shrinkage of expanded clay-OPS concretes were measured and discussed. The test results showed that partial substitution of expanded clay by OPS increased the density, compressive strength, specific strength (compressive strength to weight ratio), as well as splitting tensile and flexural strengths of lightweight concrete. However, it was observed that the modulus of elasticity decreased by about 4 and 13% in the 25 and 50% substitution levels, respectively. The expanded clay-OPS concretes showed greater drying shrinkage strain compared to expanded clay lightweight concrete. In addition, it was found that the sensitivity of compressive strength of concretes containing OPS to the lack of curing is due to high drying shrinkage and consequently micro-cracks formation in the interfacial transaction zone of the concretes.",2018
Early Concrete Structures: Patented Systems and Construction Features,chloride corrosion; compression strength; durability; early concrete; heritage; patented systems,,"Reinforced concrete structures came to Spain in the late-19th century, somewhat after the development of this new construction material elsewhere in Europe. Their introduction was pioneered in industrialized areas, especially Northern Spain, under systems first patented in other European countries. Local constructors built structures under patents with little or no explanations to account for calculation, design, and construction technique. Some of these buildings from the recent past are now listed buildings. This study centres on three construction projects under patented systems: Our Lady of La Antigua, Orduna (Monier system), La Ceres flour mill, Bilbao (Hennebique system), and Alhondiga, Bilbao (Blanc system). Preliminary structural studies analyzed morphology, reinforcements, concrete strength and pathological processes in each structure. Their results are compared with information taken from the patent systems in use at the time. This useful information on the structures, which may be expanded in future research, clearly describes the relationship between patent specifications and reality.",2018
Comparative Study on the Performance of Blended and Nonblended Fly Ash Geopolymer Composites as Durable Construction Materials,,TEMPERATURE; CONCRETE,"This article represents that the mechanical and microstructural properties and durability of fly ash-based geopolymers blended with silica fume and borax are better than those of conventional fly ash-based geopolymers. Fly ash itself contains the sources of silica and alumina which are required for geopolymerisation. But a suffcient amount of high-reactive silica is able to rapidly initiate geopolymerisation with activation. Pure potassium hydroxide pellets and sodium silicate solution were used for preparation of alkaline activator solution. Fly ash geopolymer paste exhibited better mechanical properties in the presence of silica fume with slight portion of borax. The effect of silica fume-blended geopolymer paste on temperature fluctuation (heating and cooling cycle at certain temperatures) showed better performance than nonblended fly ash-based specimens. Durability property was evaluated by immersion of geopolymer specimens in 10% magnesium sulfate solution for a period of one year. The change in weight, strength, and microstructure was studied and compared. In the magnesium sulfate solution, a significant drop of strength to around 37.26% occurred after one year for nonblended fly ash-based specimens. It is evident that specimens prepared incorporating silica fume had the best performance in terms of their properties.",2018

It is defined as an ability of building components to perform their intended load-bearing functions under fire exposure. In terms of fire resistance, the right choice of a construction material plays a key role and can reduce structural damage or even save human lives. The building industry offers a wide range of materials whose structural behaviour is more or less affected by temperature. Recently, concrete has become one of the most utilized materials used for a various kind of buildings. While the knowledge and experience with concrete behaviour under ambient temperature are well-known, the behaviour under elevated temperature has to be deeply investigated. The paper deals with observing the behaviour of concrete composites with addition of fibres under ambient and elevated temperature with the aim to determine the mechanical properties of materials. The experimental tests were conducted on three selected concrete composites which differ in a type and content of fibrous reinforcement used. The experimental work carried out was divided into several phases. First of all it was necessary to leave the produced specimens aging and drying in order to minimize the risk of unexpected damage caused by concrete spalling during heating. Time to time, the specimens were weighted with the aim to determine the loss of weight imposed by drying. Then, a heat transport test was performed on a few reference specimens in order to determine the time required for uniform heating the specimens up to 200 degrees C, 400 degrees C and 600 degrees C. In the last phase, conventional testing methods were undertaken to determine the mechanical properties of concrete composites at ambient and elevated temperature. A compression test and a splitting tensile test were conducted on 150 mm cubes. Based on the results, the peak and residual strength of the materials were determined for various temperature levels. The obtained findings contribute to improving the knowledge in the field of both concrete structures exposed to high temperature and structural behaviour of fibre reinforced concrete. The findings can be also utilized in case of the structural design of concrete structures with the high risk of fire loading.",2018
Development of multifunctional plaster using nano-TiO2 and distinct particle size cellulose fibers,Cellulose fiber; Multifunctional mortars; Rheology; MBV; Thermal conductivity; NOx photocatalytic degradation,PHOTOCATALYTIC ACTIVITY; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; RHEOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; HARDENED PROPERTIES; CONTAINING MORTARS; AMBIENT MOISTURE; INDOOR AMBIENT; CONCRETE; TIO2,"The present study reports on the development of multifunctional plaster showing superior thermal insulation, ability to control the indoor RH and NOx photocatalytic degradation. The plaster contains TiO2 nanoparticles (1 wt.%) and 0-4 wt.% fibers of two distinct sizes: 1 mm < d < 2 mm (Fb(1-2mm)) and 2 mm < d < 4mm (Fb(2-4mm)). The formulations were adjusted based on flow table and rheometer tests, aiming to assure a desirable workability. Plasters with similar workability (spread on table) showed distinct yield stress values over time and Fb((1-2mm)) plays an important role on the workability control. Rheological behaviour was governed by Fb((2-4mm)). Binary mixture 2.0Fb(1-2mm) + 2.0Fb(2-4mm)2.0Fb(2-4mm) required less water amount to show the same workability of the single formulation 4.0Fb(1-2mm). However, the control of the rheological behavior over time was found difficult. The apparent porosity, water absorption and capillary index were strongly incremented with the rise of cellulose fiber concentration. Singular and binary samples present similar results and no significant differences were observed by changing the fibers size. Plaster's buffering capacity and NOx uptake was considerably improved by using cellulose fibers, being this increment primarily governed by the fiber concentration. Formulation containing 4.0 wt.% Fb((2-4mm)) revealed the optimal performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2018
Experimental and computational evaluation of illicium verum as a novel eco-friendly corrosion inhibitor for aluminium,aluminium; corrosion inhibition; illicium verum extract; Monte Carlo simulation; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; CONCRETE,Illicium verum extract is investigated as a corrosion inhibitor of aluminium in the presence of an acid medium using gravimetric and impedance techniques. The gravimetric results reveal that the adsorption of inhibitor on the metal surface is physisorption. The impedance measurements are used to interpret the electrochemical process occurring at the interface of aluminium and corrosive medium. The surface characteristics of aluminium are evaluated using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The percentage composition of chemical constituents present in the extract is obtained using gas chromatographymass spectrometry and E-anethole is found to be the main chemical component. The interaction between the chemical constituents or inhibitor molecules and the metal surface are evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation. The determination of electron density on the inhibitor molecules is performed using density functional theory. The results from this respective study demonstrate good inhibitive properties of the illicium verum extract towards the corrosion of aluminium in concentrated hydrochloric acid solution.,2018
Experimental investigation of steel-concrete composite beams with different degrees of shear connection under monotonic and fatigue loads,failure mode; fatigue; shear connection degree; slip; steel-concrete composite beams,DAMAGE DETECTION; PART I; BEHAVIOR,"Steel-concrete composite beams have been extensively used in buildings and bridges in recent years to combine these two construction materials. The behavioral characteristics of steel-concrete composite beams are related to the degree of shear connection. In this article, eight steel-concrete composite beams were investigated to examine the effects of different degrees of shear connection on the static and fatigue performances of the beams. First, the ultimate capacity, ductility coefficient, failure modes, strain distribution at the midspan section, and relative slip distribution of the steel-concrete composite beams under monotonic loads were investigated with different shear connection degrees. The effect of the shear connection degree on the fatigue life, failure mode, and other mechanical properties under fatigue loading was studied. The results show that all mechanical properties of the steel-concrete composite beams under monotonic and fatigue loads decrease with a decrease in shear connection degree, and their failure modes change with the decreasing shear connection degree. Second, based on the experimental results, the fatigue life of composite beams was analyzed and predicted under different assumptions of failure modes according to EC4, AASHTO, and the Chinese code. The result shows that different failure modes should be considered according to different shear connection degrees in the fatigue design of composite beams. Finally, the issues on the difference between static and fatigue capacities with different shear connection degrees and the critical point of the failure mode were discussed.",2018
Self-compacting geopolymer concrete with spend garnet as sand replacement,Spent garnet; Garnet; Geopolymer concrete; Self-compacting concrete; Sand,MAGNETOPHOTONIC CRYSTALS; ENGINEERING PROPERTIES; FLY-ASH,"Garnets being the waste spin-off of surface treatment operations remain a major environmental concern worldwide. Robust engineering properties of these waste garnets offer the opportunity to get efficient construction materials via their appropriate recycling. In this spirit, we evaluate the capacity of spent garnets as sand replacement for achieving self-compacting geopolymer concrete (SCGPC). Such SCGPC specimens are prepared using ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) wherein the river sand is replaced by spent garnet at varying contents (0-100%) under constant Liquid/Binder (L/B) mass ratio of 0.4. Performance evaluations of the developed SCGPC samples are made using several tests including durability, workability, flexural, compressive, splitting tensile strength conforming the EFNARC standard. Test results revealed an enhancement in the workability of the proposed SCGPC specimen with the increase of spent garnet contents. Furthermore, other strengths are discerned to be lower compared to the control sample at all stages of replacement. It is established that the spent garnet is prospective candidate for sand replacement up to 25% in terms of environmental amiability, cost effectiveness and conservation of natural resources.",2018
Flexural behaviour of FFRP wrapped CFRC beams under static and impact loadings,Natural fibre reinforced concrete; Drop weight impact; Dynamic increase factor; Energy absorption,FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE; COMPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR; PART 1; STRENGTH; RATES; FRACTURE,"The flexural behaviour of a new construction material, flax fibre reinforced polymer (FFRP) wrapped coconut fibre reinforced concrete (CFRC) beams, under static and impact loads was investigated for the first time. Coconut fibre was mixed into concrete and the concrete beams were wrapped externally with flax fibre reinforced polymer (FFRP) laminates. Then static tests, followed by single and repeated impact tests were performed. Three different fibre contents, i.e. 1%, 3% and 5% of cement mass, corresponding to fibre volumes of respectively 0.4%, 1.2% and 2%, were considered. The effect of the coconut fibre content on the dynamic flexural load, deflection, energy absorption and dynamic increase factor (DIF) were analysed to discover the composites impact properties. The test results indicated that the flexural strength of the FFRP-CFRC beams was almost three times higher than that of CFRC beams. Dynamic increase factors (DIFs) of the FFRP-CFRC beams were found not very sensitive to the coconut fibre content but influenced by strain rate. The beams with 3% coconut fibre content were the best in resisting impact when compared with that of FFRP-CFRC beams with 1% and 5% coconut fibre content. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Socio-economic metabolism of urban construction materials: A case study of the Taipei metropolitan area,Urban metabolism; Building and infrastructure; Material-Flow analysis; Cement; Sand and gravel; Socioeconomic factors,MATERIAL FLOW-ANALYSIS; LAND RECLAMATION; TAIWAN,"Material stock is an urban issue related to urban mining. In recent years, urban metabolism issues, i.e., the determination of urban stability, have also emerged as important. The manifestation of dynamic materials in a city involves processes of importing, supply, transformation, consumption, and exporting and other activities involved in the flow of materials. Socioeconomic factors must be considered to transform study results into useful policies. This study examines cement and gravel flows in Taipei and New Taipei City to explore such concepts. Our results show that more than 80% of the construction material use in Taipei and New Taipei City is mainly dedicated to the construction of buildings and secondarily to road improvements and road maintenance. Approximately 447 t of waste concrete is generated each year, and the consumption of cement and gravel in Taipei and New Taipei City has grown over the last decade. Factors that have heavily affected urban metabolism patterns include the slowdown of economic activities after the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the emergence of new urban zoning laws. We find that roadwork has intensified dramatically due to road-smoothing and short-term urban construction projects, which may have been influenced by elections. This study measures flows in an urban metabolic system and examines socioeconomic factors that have led to an increase in the consumption of cement and gravel. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Smart bricks for strain sensing and crack detection in masonry structures,smart brick; structural health monitoring; masonry structures; self-sensing structural materials; damage detection; smart materials,DIGITAL IMAGE CORRELATION; CEMENT-BASED COMPOSITES; CARBON; TOWER; TOOL; DIAGNOSIS; CONCRETE; HERITAGE; MATRIX,"The paper proposes the novel concept of smart bricks as a durable sensing solution for structural health monitoring of masonry structures. The term smart bricks denotes piezoresistive clay bricks with suitable electronics capable of outputting measurable changes in their electrical properties under changes in their state of strain. This feature can be exploited to evaluate stress at critical locations inside a masonry wall and to detect changes in loading paths associated with structural damage, for instance following an earthquake. Results from an experimental campaign show that normal clay bricks, fabricated in the laboratory with embedded electrodes made of a special steel for resisting the high baking temperature, exhibit a quite linear and repeatable piezoresistive behavior. That is a change in electrical resistance proportional to a change in axial strain. In order to be able to exploit this feature for strain sensing, high-resolution electronics are used with a biphasic DC measurement approach to eliminate any resistance drift due to material polarization. Then, an enhanced nanocomposite smart brick is proposed, where titania is mixed with clay before baking, in order to enhance the brick's mechanical properties, improve its noise rejection, and increase its electrical conductivity. Titania was selected among other possible conductive nanofillers due to its resistance to high temperatures and its ability to improve the durability of construction materials while maintaining the aesthetic appearance of clay bricks. An application of smart bricks for crack detection in masonry walls is demonstrated by laboratory testing of a small-scale wall specimen under different loading conditions and controlled damage. Overall, it is demonstrated that a few strategically placed smart bricks enable monitoring of the state of strain within the wall and provide information that is capable of crack detection.",2018

CRT glass possesses reasonable intrinsic strength, low water absorption and rich in silica, which makes the glass suitable for use as sand or pozzolan in construction materials. This work presents a comprehensive overview of literature reporting on the reuse of CRT glass to prepare glass-ceramics; cement mortar, paste, and concrete; and bricks. The effects of various critical factors on the resulting products' performance, preparation mechanisms, leaching behavior, lead fate, and environmental and human safety were investigated. The comparison of these recycling methods, and directions for future research were discussed and reported as well. Preparing cement mortar, paste, and concrete from CRT glass offer added advantages in terms of quantity of recyclable cathode ray tube glass at a given time, with minimal environmental and economic implications and thus could be an a promising value-added uses for CRT glass. The geographical distance between waste CRT glass sources and processing facilities, public policies should be taken into account in its recycling.",2018

The obtained dioctyl terephthalate by the alcoholysis is used as a plasticizer especially in order to generate the polyvinyl chloride. Polyethylene terephthalate is generally removed by means of adding it directly to the concrete mix for the construction material. In this study; instead of using it directly in the construction materials, the alcoholysis product was obtained from the polyethylene terephthalate which was used in the concrete grout. The impact of dioctyl terephthalate on the concrete grout's properties some like electrical, mechanical and fluidity properties was analyzed by the response-surface method and it was compared with the polyethylene terephthalate additive concrete grout for those properties. The results show that the electrical resistivity of concrete increased with the increasing amount of dioctyl terephthalate. The optimum dioctyl terephthalate mixed concrete grout has got 29.90-times higher electric resistance than the reference concrete grout. Moreover, 10% of the dioctyl terephthalate mixed normal weight concrete with a lower thermal conductivity of 30.3% is higher electrical resistivity of 657.7% rather than according to 10% of the polyethylene terephthalate mixed normal weight concrete. These results also show that the dioctyl terephthalate should be preferred instead of the polyethylene terephthalate in order to produce the corrosion resistance concrete mortar.

In this context, it would be desirable to duly address those issues by searching for and assessing proper solutions and strategies: the usage of eco-friendly construction materials can be considered as one of those. This paper reports upon the performance of three facades containing sustainable products that are manufactured using natural resources and, alternatively, post-consumer waste based materials; those are: hemp-concrete; and Recycled PolyEthylene Terephthalate (R-PET), respectively. The energy performance of each facade was assessed in terms of cooling and heating demands, electrical consumptions and indoor thermal comfort including indoor temperature and relative humidity. Additionally, a Carbon Footprint (CF) assessment was carried out considering both the estimated energy demands and the life-cycle emission factors associated with the energy mix of the countries where the facades were located, i.e. France and Italy. Based upon the findings of the study, the R-PET facade represented the most performing solution between the three facades in all the scenarios considered and, moreover, the humidity-sensitive flow rate ventilation system came out as a solution able to reduce the electricity consumptions. Finally, considering the Carbon Footprint results, the energy country mix emerged as a key issue, making the Italian case study the worst one, though the total electrical energy consumption were comparable with those of the other case studies.

Practical recycling applications of crushed waste glass in construction materials: A review,Waste glass; Foamed recycled glass; Normal concrete; Asphalt concrete; Fine aggregates; Construction materials; Recycling,ALKALI-SILICA REACTION; SUPPLEMENTARY CEMENTITIOUS MATERIAL; ASPHALT CONCRETE; FINE AGGREGATE; PARTIAL REPLACEMENT; DURABILITY PROPERTIES; DEMOLITION MATERIALS; LCD GLASS; FLY-ASH; SAND,"The disposal of waste glass in landfills is an important environmental challenge that many countries face around the world. The repurposing of waste glass into a construction material reduces the consumption of natural resources, minimizes greenhouse emissions and alleviates landfill scarcity. Over the last sixty-five years, numerous investigators have studied reusing crushed waste glass (CWG) as a construction material. However, CWG has not been widely used in concrete or asphalt construction applications across the globe. Additionally, barriers still exist that prevent CWG from being used as a fine aggregate in concrete, such as the severity of Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) expansions within concrete consisting of CWG, and the lack of understanding of these reactions. This paper presents an overview of previous studies carried out by researchers to reuse CWG as an aggregate in concrete and asphalt mixtures, an aggregate in unbound base and subbase applications, lightweight engineering material and a cementitious material. From the literature review conducted, it can be concluded that CWG has potential use as an aggregate in construction materials. More research is required to clarify contradictions regarding the properties of concrete containing CWG as fine aggregate, as well as further investigation of the properties of foamed waste glass concrete and ultra-lightweight fibre reinforced concrete containing expanded waste glass, and the use of glass powder as a filler in asphalt.

Increasing rate of urbanization and industrialization has lead to over exploitation of natural resources such as river sand and gravels, which is giving rise to sustainability issues. It has now become imperative to look for alternatives of constituent materials of concrete. Waste foundry sand, a by-product of ferrous and non ferrous metal casting industries is one such promising material which can be used as an alternative to natural sand in concrete. In last few decades, several studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of addition of waste foundry sand as partial and complete replacement of regular sand in concrete. It has been found suitable to be used as partial replacement of sand in structural grade concrete. A number of properties have been reviewed in the current paper, the results observed from the various studies depict that replacement of foundry sand to a certain extent enhance the durability as well as strength properties of the concrete but simultaneously decreases the slump value with the increase of replacement level of waste foundry sand.

The long-term properties of mineral-cement-emulsion mixtures,Cold recycling of asphalt pavement; Mineral-cement-emulsion mixtures; Dynamic modulus; Phase angle; Long-term behavior,COLD RECYCLED ASPHALT; RECLAIMED ASPHALT; PERFORMANCE; STIFFNESS; STRENGTH; BITUMEN,"This publication presents evaluation of long-term behavior of mineral-cement-emulsion (MCE) mixtures. MCE mixtures are among the major products of cold recycling of old asphalt pavements. They are composed by binding of the old materials reclaimed from the pavement and new mineral aggregate using two different binding agents - cement and bituminous emulsion. While bituminous emulsion dissolutes and binds materials quite fast, it does not increase the stiffness modulus of the whole mixture. Opposite behavior occurs for cement. Its effects appear slowly and all construction materials that contain cement present the increase of strength and stiffness modulus with time. Usually the increase of strength or modulus is similar for all tested materials for the same curing periods. This article investigates the impact of combination of two binding agents and their different amounts on the increase in strength and stiffness modulus of mineral-cement-emulsion mixtures with curing time. Conducted literature and laboratory studies showed that regarding the short term changes of modulus and phase angle, mineral-cement-emulsion mixtures present similar behavior to other cement bound materials, such as cement concrete or cement-bound mixtures. In the case of long-term behavior similarities to the cement-treated materials were found as well: an increase in moduli and a decrease in phase angles were observed for longer curing times. This kind of behavior illustrates that hydraulic bonds affect both mechanical and Theological long-term properties of mineral-cement-emulsion mixtures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Anisotropic mechanical performance of 3D printed fiber reinforced sustainable construction material,3D concrete printing; Fiber reinforced geopolymer; Digital anisotropy; Mechanical properties,NANOCOMPOSITES; FABRICATION; CONCRETE,"Around the globe, ground breaking projects and case studies are being presented to showcase the potential of digital fabrication with concrete, better known as 3D printing of concrete. With these explorations, underway, the key quest in 3D concrete printing is for structural stability by means of high strength and ductility. This need could be avoided by designing printable fiber reinforcement concrete or concrete with in-process 'printed' reinforcement. Therefore, in this paper, an experimental investigation was carried out by reinforcing short glass fiber (GF) of different lengths (3 mm, 6 mmand 8 mm) and percentages (0.25%-1%) in a custom-made sustainable construction material developed for 3D printing application. Thixotropic GF/geopolymer mortar was printed using a 4-Axis gantry system and later loaded in different directions for measuring the mechanical properties. Our experimental results revealed, improved properties of the printed specimens with increase in fiber percentage up to 1% and an obvious directional dependency behaviour, caused by the layer wise deposition.

In this study, rubber granule aggregate (CRA) obtained from waste tyres with 0% (control), 5%, 10% and 15% ratios by weight was replaced with the amount of fine aggregate which remains at 1-2 mm sieve opening, and mechanical and morphological properties of the samples were investigated. For this purpose, unit weight, water absorption, compressive strength for 3,7 and 28 days, freezing-thawing (100 cycles) and ultrasonic pulse tests of concrete samples were performed. Also, SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) images and EDS (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) spectrum analyses of samples were examined.

However, it is still hard to examine those small abnormal bodies since effective reflected signal from abnormity is usually rather weak. In this paper, a new ultrasound imaging technique, equivalent offset migration (EOM), is studied to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability for detecting concrete cracks. Thus, a complex numerical model along with six small scale flaws was built, and then the ultrasonic wave propagation in concrete was modeled by high order finite difference approximation method. Numerical simulation indicates that 1) there exists a strong scattering phenomenon while ultrasound propagates in concrete with multiple small scatter flaws, and 2) EOM is capable of imaging small flaws in concrete with high resolution and accuracy.",2017
INFLUENCE OF INTERMITTENT CYCLIC LOADING ON REINFORCED CONCRETE RESISTANCE MODEL,endurance; cyclic loading; exhausting destruction; cyclic stress-induced creeps; reinforced concrete,,"This article describes the study of reinforced concrete span bending structures under conditions of high-level cyclic loading. Previous studies on the development of physical models of bending reinforced concrete element fatigue resistance, cyclic effect of lateral forces, and methods of calculation, are important and appropriate owing to certain features and the essential specificity of the mentioned loading type. These primarily include the nonlinearity of deformation, damage accumulation in the form of fatigue micro- and macro-cracks, and exhausting destruction of construction materials. In this paper, key expressions determining the endurance limits of concrete, longitudinal reinforcement, and anchoring longitudinal reinforcement, which contribute to endurance throughout the entire construction, are considered. Establishing a link between stresses in the elements and deformations in the element under conditions of cyclic loading action is of equal importance because of the presence of cyclic stress-induced creep deformation.",2017
Replacement of Coarse Aggregate with Locally Available Brick Aggregate,concrete; brick; aggregate; coarse; compressive; strength; tensile; silica fume,FRESH CONCRETE; WASTE,"Due to the abundant usage of concrete as a construction material, there is a fast dwindling source of aggregates. There are regions where there is scarcity of coarse aggregate, so to resolve this problem, Bricks Aggregates (BAs) can be used as coarse aggregate. A concrete mix ratio of 1:2:4 having characteristics strength of 3000 psi has been used in this experimental work. Compressive and tensile strength of concrete mix where 50% coarse aggregate is replaced with brick aggregate and concrete mix where 100% coarse aggregate is replaced with brick aggregate and addition of silica fume as a supplementary cementing material have been evaluated at 7, 14 and 21 days of age. The experimental test results revealed the compressive and tensile strength of concrete where coarse aggregate is replaced at 50% is almost the same as that normal concrete at the 7, 14, 21 and 28 days.",2017

Both of them are known to strongly depend on the amount of water contained in its porous network and its evolution with external conditions (temperature, humidity), which can be assessed through several sorption-desorption curves at different temperature. However, the direct measurement of these curves is particularly time consuming (up to 2 month per curve) and thus, indirect means of their determination appear of main importance for evident time saving and economical reasons. In this context, this paper focuses on the prediction of the evolution of sorption curves with temperature on earth plasters and compacted earth samples. For that purpose, two methods are proposed. The first one is an adaptation of the isosteric method, which gives the variation of relative humidity with temperature at constant water content. The second one, based on the liquid-gas interface equilibrium, gives the variation of water content with temperature at constant relative humidity. These two methods lead to quite consistent and complementary results. It underlines their capability to predict the sorption curves of the tested materials at several temperatures from the sole knowledge of one sorption curve at a given temperature. Finally, these predictions are used to scan the range of temperature variation within which the evolution of water content with temperature at constant humidity could be neglected or should be taken into account.",2017

A D-optimal mixture design was used to evaluate and optimize maximum compressive strength and heavy metals leaching by varying Thiomer (20-40 wt%), ASR fly ash (30-50 wt%) and sand (20-40 wt%). The analysis of variance was utilized to determine the level of significance of each process parameters and interactions. The microstructure of the solidified materials was taken from a field emission-scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy that confirmed successful Thiomer solidified ASR fly ash due to reduced pores and gaps in comparison with an untreated ASR fly ash. The X-ray diffraction detected the enclosed materials on the ASR fly ash primarily contained sulfur associated crystalline complexes. Results indicated the optimal conditions of 30 wt% Thiomer, 30 wt% ASR fly ash and 40 wt% sand reached a compressive strength of 54.9 MPa. For the optimum results in heavy metals leaching, 0.0078 mg/L Pb, 0.0260 mg/L Cr, 0.0007 mg/L Cd, 0.0020 mg/L Cu, 0.1027 mg/L Fe, 0.0046 mg/L Ni and 0.0920 mg/L Zn were leached out, being environmentally safe due to being substantially lower than the Korean standard leaching requirements. The results also showed that Thiomer has superiority over the commonly used Portland cement as a binding material which confirmed its potential usage as an innovative approach to simultaneously synthesize durable concrete and satisfactorily pass strict environmental regulations by heavy metals leaching.

Waste glass can be utilized in construction materials, and understanding its effects on material properties is crucial in developing advanced materials. In this study, recycled crushed and expanded glasses are used as lightweight aggregates for concrete, and their relation to the material characteristics and properties is investigated using several approaches. Lightweight concrete specimens containing only crushed and expanded waste glass as fine aggregates are produced, and their pore and structural characteristics are examined using image-based methods, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray computed tomography (CT), and automated image analysis (RapidAir). The thermal properties of the materials are measured using both Hot Disk and ISOMET devices to enhance measurement accuracy. Mechanical properties are also evaluated, and the correlation between material characteristics and properties is evaluated.

Literature shows that waste reduction and recycling have received a continuous interest from researchers, but mainly from developed countries. Few reports from low- and middle-income countries are concerned about the reuse of masonry, concrete, and mortar in clay based building ceramics or recycling construction waste, but mostly in relation to concrete aggregates. Furthermore, few authors have described the major barriers and motivations for construction waste reduction. The objective of this paper is to report the findings on a research performed in Costa Rica with the objective to determine the barriers and motivations that the construction sector is facing to improve the management of the construction materials. The study is based on data collected in two phases. During the first phase, a survey was sent via e-mail to 419 main contractors registered at the School Federation of Engineers and Architects (CFIA). The second phase consisted of a focus group discussion with 49 professionals from the construction industry to analyse and validate the findings from the survey. Descriptive statistic methods helped to draw the conclusions. The result of the research is a comprehensive list of observed barriers and motivations for waste reduction practices in the construction sector.

Building surface materials have different spectral responses in the electromagnetic energy spectrum. Remote sensors can receive the energy reflection and transmission from such materials. In this study we investigated the spectral characteristics of building materials in wavelengths ranging from 350 nm to 2500 nm. We explored a new method for identifying color steel, clay, glazed tile, and asphalt concrete using hyperspectral remote sensing based on building material spectrum characteristics. We discussed methods for extracting information about the construction materials from hyperspectral remote sensing images. We described a practical applied model, based on spectrum measurements, for the analysis of common building materials, and tested the model using hyperspectral remote sensing data from the EO-1 Hyperion sensor and Chinese airborne hyperspectral data from the pushbroom hyperspectral imager (PHI) spectrometer, covering an urban area. Our results show that building surface materials can be identified from hyperspectral remote sensing images with a reasonable quality, based on the spectral sensitivity of different building materials. For example, concrete and asphalt are more sensitive than other materials. We concluded that the proposed method based on hyperspectral remote sensing images and spectral recognition techniques is an efficient way to extract information about building materials.",2017

The clay and biomass bottom ash were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) (crystallinity), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) (chemical composition), carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulphur (CNHS) (elemental chemical analysis), and particle-size distribution. The specimens were manufactured by mixing clay and 20 by weight (wt%) of biomass bottom ash, subsequently compacted and fired at 1,000 degrees C. The fired samples were characterized to determine their technological properties. The results indicate that brick formulations containing biomass bottom ash decreased the bulk density of the control bricks. At the same time, they have suitable mechanical behavior. In addition, thermal properties of clay-biomass bottom ash are manifestly better than those of the clay control bricks. The heavy-metal concentration in the leaching test of the bottom ash-clay bricks establishes that the bricks do not present environmental problems.

The unutilized red mud stored either in slurry form or in dry stacking takes vast tract of usable land and has an adverse effect on the quality of ground water, surface water and also on animal and plant life. An attempt has been made here to characterize the coarse fraction (>75 mu m) of red mud as an alternate construction material (medium value utilization). Different physical, chemical and morphological properties are investigated and the results are compared with Indian standard sand. The morphology using particle size analyzer is elaborated and correlated with engineering properties like shear strength and flowability parameters. In addition, chemical properties like pH, electrical conductivity, total dissolve solids (TDS), zeta potential, lime reactivity and leachate analysis are also investigated along with thermal property and are compared with that of Indian standard sand. The result of zeta potential test shows that the point of zero charge of red sand lies between the pH values of 5.5-6.5. Based on the lime reactivity, the red sand is found suitable as fine aggregate for cement and concrete. Low thermal conductivity of red sand reveals that it can dissipate the heat more efficiently. Leachate analysis shows that most of the heavy metals are within acceptable limit except Al. Based on the present study, the red sand can be used as a sustainable construction material there by utilizing the industrial waste and conserving natural resources. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The literature reveals the fact that modelling of deteriorated members requires a unique consideration due to brittle section behaviour. The late adaptation of seismic regulation rules and lack of decent quality construction material supply results a vulnerable building category in the island of Cyprus. This paper examines the vulnerable building category by combining concrete strength variation with different corrosion levels. A common building type representing 1980's was selected for analyses. By using the experimental data on local materials, the corrosion rate and concrete strength specific models were generated. The analyses on brittle low strength deteriorated models yielded to a reduction both in strength and ductility. The effects of considering different concrete strength on non-seismically designed deteriorated buildings were discussed herein.",2017

They are generally disposed to open fields causing traffic hazards besides potential of health hazards and environmental pollution problems. Due to its abundance and high pozzolanic characteristics, many researchers have evaluated its potential as a construction material. This paper presents an overview of some of the published results on the successful utilization of palm oil fuel ash as a supplementary cementitious material and the properties of such concrete at fresh and hardened stages. Studies indicate that there is a promising future for the use of POFA in normal, high strength and self compacting concrete as it shows high strength, low shrinkage and permeability, high resistance to carbonation, chloride, sulfate and acidic enviromnents. At elevated temperature, the POFA concrete perform better than the ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete.

Life cycle sustainability assessment of fly ash concrete structures,Fly ash concrete; Life cycle sustainability assessment; Reliability; Service life; Single-objective optimization,CO2 EMISSION; BUILDING DESIGN; CONSTRUCTION; CEMENT; ENERGY; COST; PRODUCTS; CHINA; COAL; OPTIMIZATION,"Concrete is one of the most widespread construction materials in the world, but its production is responsible for significant amounts of energy consumption, and even greater greenhouse gas emissions. However, the substitution of Portland cement with fly ash (FA) reduces both the energy consumption and the greenhouse gas emissions generated during the production of clinker. Currently, most studies of FA concrete focus on mechanical properties, sustainability assessments (environment, society and economy) of FA during its life cycle have not been reported. This paper presents a life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) that brings together environmental, economic and social impacts using a proposed three-dimensional coordinate diagram to combine the different units into a single sustainable value. The assessment method is applied to different substitutions of FA in concrete to ascertain the optimum substitution percentage across these three factors. Monte Carlo simulation is then used to evaluate the durability of concrete structures with different FA addition in order to calculate their service life. A case study is conducted of a bridge structure with different FA substitutions; this demonstrates that the addition of FA would improve the sustainability of concrete significantly in the short term. However, when the durability and service life of the structure are taken into account, without maintenance, the use of FA concrete may not improve the environment performance due a potentially shortened service life, but it can reduce the social burden and save costs significantly over the long term.",2017

MGGP and MARS are well-established methods to construct predictive modeling equations from experimental data. These modeling equations can be used to express the relationship between the chloride ion diffusion in concrete and its influencing factors. Moreover, a data set, which contains 132 cement mortar specimens, has been collected for this study to train and verify the machine learning approaches. The prediction results of MGGP and MARS are compared with those of the Artificial Neural Network and Least Squares Support Vector Regression.

Sustainability of civil infrastructure using shape memory technology,Shape memory alloys; Confinement; Earthquakes; Composites; Concrete,CONCRETE COLUMNS; BRIDGES; COMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR; ALLOYS,"The last few decades have clearly demonstrated the vulnerability of our civil infrastructure systems to problems like aging, natural, and man-made hazards including earthquakes, hurricanes, blasts, etc. The conventional materials such as steel and concrete have proven to be limited in terms of their ability to withstand the extreme demands imposed on them by modern societies. The limitations in currently used construction materials combined with the consistently growing population worldwide present new challenges and demands for researchers in the field of structural engineering. Hence, there is an urgent need for new materials that are capable of extending the service life of structures with minimal or no need for maintenance or repairs against natural and manmade hazards. Shape memory alloy (SMA) is a class of ""Smart Materials'' that have recently emerged as potential construction material with unique thermomechanical properties, namely shape memory effect and superelasticity. Two applications of SMAs in civil structures are discussed in this paper. The first application involves the use of SMA in performing seismic rehabilitation of RC bridge columns that lack flexural ductility. In this application, SMA is used in the form of thermally prestressed spirals that can apply large active confinement pressure to the columns at their plastic hinge regions to improve their flexural ductility. The experimental results of large scale shake table tests performed on two RC columns, one of which is retrofitted with SMA are discussed. The results demonstrate the great ability of SMA spirals in mitigating the damage even under strong levels of ground shaking. The second application focuses on utilizing superelastic SMA fibers as reinforcement for polymeric composite bars. The newly developed composite material is named SMA-Fiber Reinforced Polymer (SMA-FRP), and is studied as seismic reinforcing bars for moment resisting concrete frames. The results of nonlinear time history analysis prove that using SMA-FRP bars at the plastic hinge regions of the frames helps significantly in limiting the residual drifts and enhancing the energy dissipation of the frames.",2017
Behaviour of CFRC beams strengthened by FFRP laminates under static and impact loadings,Drop weight impact; Impact resistance; Flax fibre reinforced polymer; Coconut fibre reinforced concrete; Damage pattern,FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE; RESISTANCE,"This paper investigates the impact resistance of a new construction material, being coconut fibre reinforced concrete (CFRC) beams strengthened with flax fibre reinforced polymer (FFRP) laminates. To study the impact resistance of the material, a series of CFRC specimens with various FFRP thicknesses (2-, 4 and 6-layer) were experimentally studied through static and drop weight impact tests. Parameters of the FFRP-CFRC beams, i.e. the impact force, deflection, energy absorption, dynamic increase factor (DIF) and damage pattern were studied. In addition, the influence of the FFRP laminate thickness was investigated in terms of (1) flexural strength and toughness under static loading, (2) flexural behaviour under impact loading, and (3) failure mode. The results showed that FFRP laminates were effective in enhancing the flexural strength under both static and impact loadings. It is also suggested that FFRPCFRC composites could be used as environmentally-friendly materials for protective structures in resisting impact loadings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Geopolymer is considered as a green construction material and its use in AM may contribute towards sustainable environment since in AM process material is only deposited whereby it is necessary. As part of this research, an industrial robot was employed to print geopolymer mortar in layer-by-layer manner directly from 3D computer-aided design (CAD) model. The characteristic of raw materials and fresh properties were examined by rheology, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mechanical tests such as compression, flexural and tensile bond strength were conducted on the printed geopolymer in different printing directions and their performance was compared with casted samples. It was found, from the experimental results, that the mechanical properties of 3D printed geopolymer are mostly dependent of loading directions due to anisotropic nature of the printing process and retains intrinsic performance of the material.

On carbon dioxide utilization as a means to improve the sustainability of ready-mixed concrete,Concrete; Carbon footprint; Construction materials; Environmental impact; Carbon dioxide utilization,CEMENT-BASED MATERIALS; CO2; BLOCKS,"Concrete is the world's most important and widely used construction material. Carbon dioxide utilization in the production of ready mixed concrete was investigated through the injection of an optimal amount of CO2 during batching and mixing. The carbon dioxide improved the concrete compressive strength with minimal impact on fresh air content or workability. Three-way comparisons between a reference batch, reduced binder batch and reduced binder batch with CO2 addition, confirmed that the carbon dioxide could allow for a 5-8% reduction in binder loading without compromising strength. A model case shows that integrating a CO2 utilization step into conventional concrete production can, net of process emissions, reduce the carbon footprint of the concrete by 4.6%. The direct utilization is amplified to attain a carbon footprint improvement that is more than 35 times larger than the amount of carbon dioxide required. One year production at a medium sized producer would use about 24 tonnes of carbon dioxide to achieve nearly 897 tonnes of CO2 absorbed and avoided. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017

Use of steel slag as a construction material requires understanding of its engineering properties and development of a methodology to address its swelling potential. This paper focuses on the results of a series of laboratory tests (grain-size analysis, X-ray diffraction, specific gravity, compaction, maximum and minimum dry unit weight, direct shear, and long-term swelling tests) performed on samples of electric-arc-furnace ladle (EAF(L)) steel slag to assess its potential to be used as a geo-material. Direct shear test results indicated that the EAF(L) steel slag exhibits comparable frictional properties to angular crushed sand. Based on the leachate concentration levels from TCLP analyses, the EAF(L) steel slag tested was classified as Type III Solid Waste. The long-term, one-dimensional (1D) swelling test results showed continued volumetric expansion even after more than 16 months of monitoring. Replacing 5-10% by weight of EAF (L) steel slag with Class C fly ash reduced the 1D swelling to negligible levels. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017

The renewability and biodegradability of starch has made it an interesting material for industrial applications, such as production of bioplastic. This paper introduces the application of corn starch in the production of a novel construction material, named CoRncrete. CoRncrete is formed by mixing corn starch with sand and water. The mixture appears to be self-compacting when wet. The mixture is poured in a mould and then heated in a microwave or an oven. This heating causes a gelatinisation process which results in a hardened material having compressive strength up to 26 MPa. The factors affecting the strength of hardened CoRncrete such as water content, sand aggregate size and heating procedure have been studied. The degradation and sustainability aspects of CoRncrete are elucidated and limitations in the potential application of this material are discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017

Flyash is a waste material obtained from thermal power plants during combustion of pulverized coal. The research in relation to the use of sintered flyash aggregate to produce structural lightweight concrete is summarized in this paper. The manuscript discussed about the constituent parameters of the aggregate such as physical and chemical properties of flyash as well as binders, the pelletization parameters such as angle of inclination, rotation speed and duration of pelletization process and its influence on the aggregate properties. Also, the paper discussed about the sintering parameters such as temperature and duration of sintering and its significances. The physical and mechanical properties of the sintered flyash aggregates were also briefed. The review of literatures show that the specific gravity of these aggregate was 16-46% less than that of the normal weight aggregates and possess higher water absorption. The fresh, mechanical and durability properties of the concrete produced with sintered flyash concrete were also summarized. Sintered flyash aggregate concretes have the 28-day compressive strengths in the range of 27-74 MPa, with densities in the range of 1651-2017 kg/m(3). The durability properties of the flyash aggregate concretes indicate that the performance is satisfactory for structural applications.

Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing bar and alkali activated cement (AAC) concrete are promising alternative construction materials for steel bars and Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concretes respectively. In this study, the bond behaviour between GFRP bars, and MC and OPC concretes is investigated by using beam-end test specimens. Sand-coated GFRP bars with 12.7 mm and 15.9 mm diameters and embedment lengths of six and nine times the bar diameter were used. The free end and the loaded end bond slip relationships, the failure mode and the average bond stress were used to analyse each of the specimens. Additionally, the distribution of tensile and bond stress along the embedment length was investigated by installing strain gauges along the embedment length. The results of the study indicate that the tensile and bond stress distribution along the embedment length are nonlinear, and the nonlinearity changes with the load. Finite element analysis was also performed to further study the bond stress distribution along the embedment length of the bar. From the finite element analysis, it was found that the bond stress distribution depends on the embedment length of the specimens; approaching uniform distribution as the embedment length decreases.

The case study deals with a material submitted to a variation in temperature and relative humidity on its surface. A significant change is noticed around a relative humidity psi=95%. Below this threshold the temperature gradient is the main driving force for moisture transfer. The dominant mechanism becomes the capillary pressure gradient when psi > 95%. In the latter relative humidity range, phase change enthalpy becomes in the same order of magnitude as conduction heat transfer. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017

A D-optimal mixture design was further utilized in order to evaluate and optimize the parameters of Thiomer (25-35 wt%), ASR bottom ash (30-45 wt%) and sand (30-40 wt%) on the response of compressive strength. Result showed that optimum compressive strength of 55.9 MPa can be attained at 33.6, 36.4 and 30.0 wt% of Thiomer, ASR bottom ash and sand, respectively. The solidified Thiomer specimen showed superior structural strength over ordinary Portland cement concrete at curing time of 1 and 7 days. Furthermore, a mean heavy metal concentrations of 0.055 ppm C2+, 0.105 ppm Zn2+, 0.045 ppm Pb2+, 0.078 ppm Cr6+ and 0.002 ppm Cd2+ were achieved at various mixture designs in the heavy metal immobilization which satisfies stringent environmental standards. Thus, the application of Thiomer proves to be a promising construction material that can pose as an alternative over common cement due to promoting high durability and being eco-friendly.

A comparative life cycle study of alternative materials for Australian multi-storey apartment building frame constructions: Environmental and economic perspective,Laminated Veneer Lumber; Concrete; Steel; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Sustainable constructions,LAMINATED TIMBER; ENERGY ANALYSIS; WOOD; CONCRETE; EFFICIENCY; INVENTORY; PRODUCTS; INDUSTRY; IMPACTS; SECTOR,"The building construction sector contributes to a quarter of the total Australian Greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions are mainly attributed to the use of energy intensive materials. To achieve better environmental benefits and cost saving, the utilisation of wood-based construction materials is currently attracting attention. However, the manufacturing of engineered wood products consumes large quantities of chemicals and energy, which may have adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, a life cycle study was conducted to compare various materials for constructing the structural frame of a 4-storey apartment building compliant with the Australian building codes. Five alternatives were assessed: Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) manufactured from early to mid-rotation hardwood plantation logs (LVLm), LVL manufactured from mature hardwood plantations (LVLh), LVL manufactured from mature softwood plantations (LVLS), concrete and steel. The functional unit was defined as the whole building structural frame. Global Warming Potential (GWP), Acidification, Eutrophication, Fossil Depletion, Human-toxicity Potential (HTP) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) were evaluated. The LVL generally performed better than concrete and steel structural products. Particularly, LVLm had the lowest GWP (2.84E4 +/- 233 kg-CO2-eq) and LCC ($128,855 +/- 2797), which were less than a quarter of the concrete option. However, the usage of chemical preservatives and phenol-formaldehyde adhesive during the LVL production and treatment caused the HTP impact to be higher than the steel option. Monte Carlo Analysis showed that while the LVL options presented a higher sensitivity to the combined uncertainties, the overall ranking of the five options remained the same. Therefore, the inclusion of wood-based material in structural elements may significantly contribute to reduce the environmental impacts and the LCC of the construction sector. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

A new eco-friendly chip seal pavement, in which the mineral aggregate was replaced by crumb rubber obtained from scrap tires, was investigated in this study. A total of 142 chip seal specimens were prepared and tested to investigate the impact of using recycled rubber aggregate on the chip seal's micro and macro texture and their impacts on the skid resistance. The microtexture of the new proposed recycled aggregate was examined using a high resolution 3D digital microscope. The macrotexture of the new chip seal pavement was examined using image processing and sand patch methods. The skid resistance of the new chip seal under both ambient and elevated temperatures was then explored. Two types of emulsions, two types of asphalt cement binders, two types of mineral aggregate as well as two types of recycled crumb rubber were involved in the examined test matrix. This study concluded that the crumb rubber can be used in the chip seal as partial or full replacement of mineral aggregates. Using crumb rubber has a significant impact on improving both macrotexture and microtexture of chip seal. In addition, the low thermal conductivity of crumb rubber helped the chip seal resist elevated temperature without significant loss in skid resistance. A 3D geometrical model was then proposed to simulate the aggregate embedment so it can be used to design the required binder application rate that provides adequate embedment depth and skid resistance.

The present work advocates the leverage of lime (L), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) (G) and curing period (t) in quantifying the unconfined compressive strength (q(u)) and split tensile strength (q(t)) of artificially cemented jarosite. A number of strength tests are carried out on jarosite stabilised with various contents of lime (2.5-10%) and GGBS (10-40%). The results show that both, q(u). and qt increase non-linearly with the increase in lime and GGBS content. A power function has been fitted to assess the best relationship between q(t)/q(u) and L, t and G. Finally, a unique relationship between q(t) and q(u) is established - that is q(t)/q(u), being independent of all the above-listed parameters. The microstructural study also shows the presence of larger agglomeration of particles on addition of GGBS and lime, implying an increase in strength of stabilised jarosite waste.",2017
Assessment of Thermally Deteriorated Concrete by Drilling Resistance Test and Sound Level,concrete; elevated temperatures; residual strength; drilling resistance tests,ROCK PROPERTIES; STRENGTH,"Concrete being the most versatile and widely used construction material finds application in varied range of structures. Many of these like chimneys, furnaces and reactors have to sustain high temperatures and perhaps all structures have to perform at elevated temperatures in the event of fire accidents. Concrete at elevated temperatures undergoes changes in its physical structure and chemical composition and loses its strength characteristics. Need for quick assessment of fire damaged concrete for strength characteristics, has motivated this work, which explores the potential of drilling resistance test on concrete as a Non Destructive Testing (NDT) tool. Drilling times, penetration depths and sound level measurement while drilling have been recorded and analysed to provide monograms that are handy as reckoners in failure forensics.",2017

Previous studies and many modern design codes place some limits on the strength of steel and concrete for designing steel-concrete composite members, attributed to insufficient test data and design experience on their applications in construction. With this research gap being identified, an experimental program has been carried out to investigate the composite behaviour of concrete filled steel tubes (CFST) employing high tensile strength steel (FITS) and ultra-high strength concrete (UHSC). Both concentric and eccentric compression loads were applied to evaluate the overall buckling resistances and moment-axial force interaction with second-order effect considered. The yield strength of FITS under the investigation was about 800 N/mm(2) and the concrete compressive cylinder strength was up to 200 N/mm2. To examine the test results, the rotational stiffness of semi-rigid end supports was analytically derived and the stress-strain models of HTS and UHSC were properly calibrated to predict the composite behaviour through finite element analysis. The Eurocode 4 approach was then checked regarding its applicability to the said high- and ultra-high strength construction materials for composite design. A new database including 1160 test data was established to further study the reliability of the use of FITS and UHSC, and suggestions were made to extend the Eurocode 4 design approach.

A preventive strengthening method for steel columns: Experimental study and numerical analyses,Steel column; Preventive maintenance; Corrosion; Service life; Major axis; Minor axis,BRIDGES,"Techniques for structural repair and maintenance are becoming increasingly important because of increasing problems associated with aging structures. This paper introduces a method for strengthening aged steel columns by using new construction materials such as glass-fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) plates, rapid-hardening concrete, rubber-latex mortar, and reinforcing bars. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the mechanical performance of steel columns before and after strengthening, thereby assessing the effectiveness of the proposed strengthening method. Depending on the possible directions of applied load (major axis or minor axis) and the corrosion conditions, three specimens were employed in the loading tests. Static loading tests were performed on steel columns with and without strengthening. Test results, including load-deflection relationships and the strain development process of the columns, were measured and compared between the original and strengthened columns. Moreover, three-dimensional finite-element models were built to compare the strengthened and original steel columns. Both the experimental and numerical results indicate that the proposed strengthening method can significantly enhance the stiffness in the elastic stage and the load-carrying capacities in the plastic stage, resulting in significant extension of residual service life under real service conditions and improvement of seismic performance during earthquakes.

Life cycle assessment for environmental product declaration of concrete in the Gulf States,Qatari concrete; Life cycle assessment; Environmental product declaration,DESALINATION TECHNOLOGIES; WESTERN-AUSTRALIA,"Construction is the fastest-growing sector in Qatar, with a growth rate of 11.4% per year due to commencement of mega-projects. The construction industry causes significant environmental impacts in terms of global warming impacts and embodied energy consumption. Qatar has set an ambitious target to build a large number of `green or carbon-neutral' buildings across the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) by 2030. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been a crucial part in achieving this target of green infrastructure design as it offers an objective and consistent way to measure environmental impacts of construction materials and assemblies. This LCA, the first of its kind, has been carried out following Gulf Green Mark -Environmental Product Declaration-Product Category Role (GGM-EPD PCR) to assess the environmental performance of precast and ready-mix concrete using data from a Qatari concrete manufacturer. This methodology can potentially be applied to similar and other construction materials in the Gulf States to mitigate environmental impacts associated with the continuous booming of their construction industries. Current analysis shows that the use of recycled steel and electricity generated from solar radiation for concrete materials and concrete production could further reduce the environmental impacts of these Qatari products.",2017

Yet, significant efforts in improving the environmental awareness and sustainability of the construction sector are arising through the introduction of the numerous regulations, directives, and initiatives. This review work provides an overview of the most relevant existing European policies and legislation for the built environment, and the construction materials in particular. The implementation of a comparative assessment against the key elements of the international legislation and efforts enables the definition of the responsiveness of the EU in enacting policies that ensure the environmental sustainability of the sector, as well as identifies prospects for further improvement. Working towards the increase of the sustainability of the construction sector in a framework of holistic life cycle considerations is promoted in the current legislation, where identifying opportunities for energy and cost savings, utilizing natural resources efficiently and achieving waste minimization is endorsed. This work can be exploited from both policy- makers and the scientific community as guidance for transforming in a truly green sustainable construction market. The conclusions of this work indicate that the sustainability of the built environment will come through the increased use of alternative, recycled, natural and unconventional construction materials and thermal insulation materials, the exploitation of prefabricated building elements, the integration of LCA with BIM, the employment of multi- objective optimization methodologies, and the development of country- specific data for the implementation of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. These fields, as well as other factors such as globilisation and government intervention, are critical for fulfilling the vision of the European Union (EU) and will require systematic approach for their incorporation in the relevant policies to be developed and introduced in the near future.",2017
Development of the CO2 Emission Evaluation Tool for the Life Cycle Assessment of Concrete,concrete; greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; life cycle assessment (LCA),ASSESSMENT LCA,"With the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 26.9% below business-as-usual by 2020, the construction industry is recognized as an environmentally harmful industry because of the large quantity of consumption and waste with which it is associated, and the industry has therefore been requested to become more environmentally friendly. Concrete, a common construction material, is known to emit large amounts of environmentally hazardous waste during the processes related to its production, construction, maintenance, and demolition. To aid the concrete industry's efforts to reduce its GHG emissions, this study developed a software program that can assess GHG emissions incurred over the life cycle of a concrete product, and a case study was conducted to determine the impact of the proposed concrete assessment program on a construction project.",2017

FRPs have high specific strength and stiffness compared to conventional construction materials, e.g., steel. Ease of preparation and installation, resistance to corrosion, versatile fabrication and adjustable mechanical properties are other advantages of the FRPs. However, there are major concerns about long-term performance, serviceability and durability of FRP applications in concrete structures. Therefore, structural health monitoring (SHM) and damage detection in FRP-retrofitted concrete structures need to be implemented. This paper presents a study on investigating the application of Rayleigh wave for detecting debonding defect in FRP-retrofitted concrete structures. A time-of-flight (ToF) method is proposed to determine the location of a debonding between the FRP and concrete using Rayleigh wave. A series of numerical case studies are carried out to demonstrate the capability of the proposed debonding detection method. In the numerical case studies, a three-dimensional (3D) finite element (FE) model is developed to simulate the Rayleigh wave propagation and scattering at the debonding in the FRP-retrofitted concrete structure. Absorbing layers are employed in the 3D FE model to reduce computational cost in simulating the practical size of the FRP-retrofitted structure. Different debonding sizes and locations are considered in the case studies. The results show that the proposed ToF method is able to accurately determine the location of the debonding in the FRP-retrofitted concrete structure.",2017
Unsaturated hydraulic behaviour of a permeable pavement: Laboratory investigation and numerical analysis by using the HYDRUS-2D model,LID; Permeable pavement; Urban drainage; Sensitivity analysis; Infiltration,CEMENT PERVIOUS CONCRETE; CATCHMENT-SCALE; GREEN ROOFS; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; POROUS PAVEMENT; URBAN DRAINAGE; WATER; CONDUCTIVITY; RUNOFF; IMPACT,"An adequate hydrological description of water flow in permeable pavement systems relies heavily on the knowledge of the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the construction materials. Although several modeling tools and many laboratory methods already exist in the literature to determine the hydraulic properties of soils, the importance of an accurate materials hydraulic description of the permeable pavement system, is increasingly recognized in the fields of urban hydrology. Thus, the aim of this study is to propose techniques/procedures on how to interpret water flow through the construction system using the HYDRUS model. The overall analysis includes experimental and mathematical procedures for model calibration and validation to assess the suitability of the HYDRUS-2D model to interpret the hydraulic behaviour of a lab-scale permeable pavement system. The system consists of three porous materials: a wear layer of porous concrete blocks, a bedding layers of fine gravel, and a sub-base layer of coarse gravel. The water regime in this system, i.e. outflow at the bottom and water contents in the middle of the bedding layer, was monitored during ten irrigation events of various durations and intensities. The hydraulic properties of porous concrete blocks and fine gravel described by the van Genuchten functions were measured using the clay tank and the multistep outflow experiments, respectively. Coarse gravel properties were set at literature values. In addition, some of the parameters (K-s of the concrete blocks layer, and alpha, n and K-s of the bedding layer) were optimized with the HYDRUS-2D model from water fluxes and soil water contents measured during irrigation events. The measured and modeled hydrographs were compared using the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) index (varied between 0.95 and 0.99) while the coefficient of determination R-2 was used to assess the measured water content versus the modelled water content in the bedding layer (R-2 = 0.81 divided by 0.87). The parameters were validated using the remaining sets of measurements resulting in NSE values greater than 0.90 (0.91 divided by 0.99) and R-2 between 0.63 and 0.91. Results have confirmed the applicability of HYDRUS-2D to describe correctly the hydraulic behaviour of the lab scale system. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017

Impact of structural design solutions on the energy and thermal performance of an Australian office building,Energy efficiency; Ultra-lightweight concrete; Office building; Structural design,RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE; GEOPOLYMER CONCRETE; LIGHTWEIGHT; ASH; CONDUCTIVITY,"Concrete is a heavyweight construction material whose high thermal mass could increase the thermal storage capacity of a building envelope and in turn affect indoor thermal comfort. Selecting an appropriate method for concrete construction and form could also affect the total energy performance and thermal comfort of a building, a fact that is often overlooked by structural engineers. This study presents the results of energy simulations of the potential impact that concrete construction forms, in particular two slab types, and structural materials have on the energy consumption of archetypal commercial office buildings in five major Australia cities (Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Brisbane and Darwin). This study has three stages: 1) a structural analysis of two slab types (Flat and Waffle slab); 2) the selection of two types of structural concrete (conventional Normal weight concrete and novel Ultra-lightweight concrete); 3) a comparative analysis to quantify the magnitude of the change in predicted annual energy consumption due to changes in the form of construction and the type of structural concrete. The energy simulation results showed that the thermal energy performance of the building was influenced by structural materials and slab types. It is shown that the thermal capacity of the concrete construction forms can be utilized to shift thermal loads, reduce peak demand and reduce operational energy consumption. The selection of an appropriate concrete type was more important in terms of energy performance in the coldest (Melbourne and Canberra) and hottest (Darwin) climate zones of this study.

THE BEHAVIOR OF CARBON FIBER REINFORCED POLYMER (CFRP) STRENGTHENED BEAMS UNDER A MARINE ENVIRONMENT,Concrete reinforced structures; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP); Marine environment,CONCRETE BEAMS; RC BEAMS; SHEETS,"Marine concrete structures are subjected to a harsh environment and potential climate change variables. Deterioration of the structure demands drastic measures for repair and rehabilitation. Advanced composite materials exhibit unique advantages compared to conventional construction materials. Over the years, carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite material has been used widely for the repair and rehabilitation of structures. Many studies have been conducted on the performance of FRP flexural strengthened reinforced concrete (RC) members. Still, experimental studies investigating the performance of shear strengthening under real environmental conditions are lacking. This paper helps fill this gap because it is an experimental investigation of the behavior of CFRP shear strengthened RC beams under a marine environment. Specimens were exposed to cyclic (wet/dry) and full exposure to the elements for a 3-month period. Six strengthened beams and one unstrengthened beam were tested; the tested control beam failed due to a diagonal-tension crack. The increase in the concrete shear capacity of the strengthened specimens was in the range of 14-18% compared to the control beam. Thus, the results lead to the conclusion that CFRP strengthening increases the shear capacity of specimens considerably.",2017

Early age formation of micro-cracking in concrete structure severely affects the serviceability leading to high cost of maintenance. Apart from conventional methods of repairing cracks with sealants or treating the concrete with adhesive chemicals to prevent the cracks from widening, a microbial crack-healing approach has shown promising results. The unique feature of the microbial system is that it enables self-healing of concrete. The effectiveness of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICCP) in improving durability of cementitious building materials, restoration of stone monuments and soil bioclogging is discussed. Main emphasis has been laid on the potential of bacteria-based crack repair in concrete structure and the applications of different bacterial treatments to self-healing cracks. Furthermore, recommendations to employ the MICCP technology at commercial scale and reduction in the cost of application are provided in this review.",2017

CMUs are still produced using non-renewable natural aggregate which creates pressure on the natural resources and resulted in unsustainable production. Moreover, one of the drawbacks of using CMUs is its relatively high thermal conductivity and low thermal insulation capacity compared to other options such as lumber and dry walls. Motivated by the reasons above, an experimental investigation was undertaken where the mineral aggregate in CMUs was partially replaced by recycled rubber aggregate, manufactured from scrap tires, producing what is called rubberized concrete masonry units (RCMUs). This paper presents the results of the thermal conductivity and the energy efficiency of RCMUs having replacement ratios of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 37%. The thermal properties, including thermal conductivity, time to reach the thermal steady state and energy efficiency, were investigated at the material and unit levels using four different approaches. RCMUs with 10%, 20%, 37% rubber replacement ratio exhibited a reduction in thermal conductivity of 9.5%, 20%, 45% at the material level and 22%, 26%, and 34% at the unit level, respectively. Furthermore, RCMUs with 37% rubber replacement ratio cut the energy consumption by 41% compared to conventional CMUs. Results indicated that the RCMUs are more efficient by cutting both embodied and operation energy as well as it has lower thermal conductivity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017

The present survey was focused in the evaluation of activity concentration of Rn-222 and other radioisotopes related to the building materials at workplaces at Curitiba Parana State. For this purpose, the instant radon detector AlphaGUARD (Saphymo GmbH) was used to measure the average concentrations of Rn-222 in building materials, which were also submitted to gamma spectrometry analysis for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the radionuclides present in samples of sand, mortar, blue crushed stone (Gneissic rock), red crushed stone (Granite), concrete and red bricks.

Conception of a 3D Metamaterial-Based Foundation for Static and Seismic Protection of Fuel Storage Tanks,seismic isolation; multiscale resonators; metamaterials; smart foundations; fuel storage tanks; earthquake engineering,PROPAGATION; RESONATORS; LATTICES; ARRAYS; WAVES,"Fluid-filled tanks in tank farms of industrial plants can experience severe damage and trigger cascading effects in neighboring tanks due to large vibrations induced by strong earthquakes. In order to reduce these tank vibrations, we have explored an innovative type of foundation based on metamaterial concepts. Metamaterials are generally regarded as manmade structures that exhibit unusual responses not readily observed in natural materials. If properly designed, they are able to stop or attenuate wave propagation. Recent studies have shown that if locally resonant structures are periodically placed in a matrix material, the resulting metamaterial forms a phononic lattice that creates a stop band able to forbid elastic wave propagation within a selected band gap frequency range. Conventional phononic lattice structures need huge unit cells for low-frequency vibration shielding, while locally resonant metamaterials can rely on lattice constants much smaller than the longitudinal wavelengths of propagating waves. Along this line, we have investigated 3D structured foundations with effective attenuation zones conceived as vibration isolation systems for storage tanks. In particular, the three-component periodic foundation cell has been developed using two common construction materials, namely concrete and rubber. Relevant frequency band gaps, computed using the Floquet-Bloch theorem, have been found to be wide and in the low-frequency region. Based on the designed unit cell, a finite foundation has been conceived, checked under static loads and numerically tested on its wave attenuation properties. Then, by means of a parametric study we found a favorable correlation between the shear stiffness of foundation walls and wave attenuation. On this basis, to show the potential improvements of this foundation, we investigated an optimized design by means of analytical models and numerical analyses. In addition, we investigated the influence of cracks in the matrix material on the elastic wave propagation, and by comparing the dispersion curves of the cracked and uncracked materials we found that small cracks have a negligible influence on dispersive properties. Finally, harmonic analysis results displayed that the conceived smart foundations can effectively isolate storage tanks.",2017

This investigation addresses the characterization of a new animal fiber (pig hair), a massive food-industry waste worldwide, and its use in mortars. Morphological, physical and mechanical properties of pig hair are determined in order to be used as reinforcement in mortars. A sensitivity analysis on the volumes of fiber in mortars is developed. The results from this investigation showed that reinforced mortars significantly improve impact strength, abrasion resistance, plastic shrinkage cracking, age at cracking, and crack widths as fiber volume increases. Other properties such as compressive and flexural strength, density, porosity and modulus of elasticity of reinforced mortars are not significantly affected by the addition of pig hair.

Life cycle assessment of adoption of local recycled aggregates and green concrete in Singapore perspective,Life cycle assessment (LCA); Construction and demolition waste (C&DW); Recycled aggregates; Material importation and transportation; Life cycle inventory (LCI),CONVENTIONAL CONCRETE; DEMOLITION WASTE; LCA; CONSTRUCTION; STEEL,"Singapore is a city-state with limited land space and resources, and most construction materials are imported from foreign countries. In this study, a detailed whole building life cycle assessment (LCA) of a base case building in Singapore as well as material LCA were conducted with customized life cycle inventory datasets by considering materials importation and transportation in particular, and by considering the effects of adopting local recycled aggregates. Results showed that importation and transportation of construction materials significantly alter environmental impacts. This highlights the necessity of considering transportation for importing materials in Singapore context. Inclusion of local recycled aggregates for concrete production to reduce potential environmental load is significant.

Although it is well documented that the materials comprising artificial structures influence the composition of organisms that use them as habitat, little is known about how these materials may chemically react with changing seawater conditions, and what effects this will have on associated biota. We investigated the effects of ocean warming, acidification, and type of coastal infrastructure material on algal turfs. Seawater acidification resulted in greater covers of turf, though this effect was counteracted by elevated temperatures. Concrete supported a greater cover of turf than granite or high-density polyethylene (HDPE) under all temperature and pH treatments, with the greatest covers occurring under simulated ocean acidification. Furthermore, photosynthetic efficiency under acidification was greater on concrete substratum compared to all other materials and treatment combinations. These results demonstrate the capacity to maximise ecological benefits whilst still meeting local management objectives when engineering coastal defense structures by selecting materials that are appropriate in an ocean change context. Therefore, mitigation efforts to offset impacts from sea-level rise and storms can also be engineered to alter, or even reduce, the effects of climatic change on biological assemblages.

This study investigates the replacement of different sizes of bottom ash into Portland cement by reducing the content of Portland cement and examined the mechanism between bottom ash (BA) and Portland cement. A cement composite developed by 10% replacement with 1, 7, 14, and 28 days of curing and exhibited excellent mechanical strength on day 28 (34.23 MPa) with 63 pm BA. The porous structure of BA results in lower density as the fineness particles size contains high specific surface area and consume high quantity of water. The morphology, mineralogical, and ternary phase analysis showed that pozzolanic reaction of bottom ash does not alter but complements and integrates the cement hydration process which facilitate effectively the potential of bottom ash to act as construction material.",2017
Wound FRP Shear Reinforcement for Concrete Structures,Fiber-reinforced polymer; Reinforcement; Carbon fiber; Filament winding; Wound-fiber-reinforced polymer (W-FRP),BEHAVIOR; MEMBERS; BEAMS,"This paper describes the outcomes of recent research that is, for the first time, aiming to completely replace internal steel reinforcement in concrete structures with knitted prefabricated cages made of highly durable fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforcement. The proposed manufacturing technique, based on the filament winding process, allows the reinforcement to be fabricated in a precisely calculated geometry with the aim of providing tensile strength exactly where it is needed. The resulting wound FRP (W-FRP) cage designs capitalize on the extraordinary flexibility and lightness offered by FRP construction materials. This paper presents fundamental analytical and experimental studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of the wound reinforcement system and forms the basis of future efforts to develop fully automated manufacturing methods for concrete structures.

Economic Evaluation of High-Strength Materials in Stocky Reinforced Concrete Shear Walls,Construction costs; Construction materials and methods; Finite-element modeling; High-strength concrete; High-strength reinforcing steel; Reinforced concrete stocky shear walls; Safety-related nuclear structures,JUSTIFYING MATERIALS SELECTION,"Previous numerical research has shown that high-strength steel reinforcing bars (rebar) combined with high-strength concrete can increase the lateral strength of stocky (i.e., low height-to-length aspect ratio) reinforced concrete (RC) walls in noncontainment safety-related nuclear structures as well as nonnuclear building structures. However, there is currently no quantitative information on the cost-effectiveness of using high-strength materials in stocky RC shear walls. Specifically, high-strength materials can lower the total rebar volume and simplify the rebar cage construction. Furthermore, reduced rebar congestion can allow for better field inspection and easier concrete placement, potentially accelerating construction schedules and reducing construction costs. This paper addresses the current knowledge gap by conducting a parametric numerical investigation on the total rebar weight and construction cost for stocky RC shear walls. The study focuses on walls typical of noncontainment nuclear structures, but also includes results relevant for nonnuclear building structures. Ultimately, the results demonstrate the economic benefits of high-strength materials for stocky walls in nuclear structures and may provide an impetus to positively affect policy decisions pertaining to nuclear power in the United States.

Assessing the Rebound Hammer Test for Rammed Earth Material,sustainable development; rammed earth; compressive strength; rebound hammer test; nondestructive test,ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; WALLS; DURABILITY; BEHAVIOR; COMFORT; ENERGY,"Rammed-earth (RE) is a construction material manufactured from the soil. The soil is compacted at its optimum water content, inside a formwork to build a monolithic wall. RE material is attracting renewed interest throughout the world thanks to its sustainable characteristics: low embodied energy, substantial thermal inertia, and natural regulator of moisture; on the other hand, the existing historic RE buildings is still numerous. This is why several research studies have been carried out recently to study different aspects of this material. However, few investigations have been carried out to explore the possibility of applying the nondestructive techniques on RE walls. This paper presents an assessment of the well-known rebound hammer test on RE walls. The calibration curves of the rebound hammer test have been established for conventional concrete where the rebound number is more than 20. For RE material with lower compressive strengths, a new calibration curve must be established. In the present study, two soils were used and different homogenized specimens with different dry densities were manufactured and tested, to plot a general calibration curve. Then, this calibration curve was applied to RE specimens; different results at different positions in an earthen layer were observed, due to the inhomogeneity of the material. The final results showed an acceptable accuracy of the calibration curve in the prediction of the compressive strength of RE material.",2017
The contribution of wood-based construction materials for leveraging a low carbon building sector in europe,Engineered wood products; Policy drivers; Scenario modelling; Potential GHG emission savings,OPPORTUNITIES; INNOVATION; GERMANY,"Increasing the use of engineered wood products in the European Union can contribute to leveraging a shift towards a more emission-efficient production of construction materials. Engineered timber products have already been substituted for carbon and energy intensive concrete and steel-based building constructions, but they still lack the capacities and market demand to be more than just a niche market. However, in the post-crisis period after 2008 the consumption of engineered wood products began rising in Europe. In this paper we analyse options for the future development of engineered wood products taking into consideration policy barriers and technical and environmental potentials for accelerating market introduction as part of a comprehensive scenario approach. For the European building sector we assessed an achievable potential for net carbon storage of about 46 million tonnes CO2-eqv. per year in 2030. To unlock this potential a bundle of instruments is necessary for increasing the market share for engineered wood products against the backdrop of existing policy instruments such as the gradual introduction of stricter rules for carbon emissions trading or more incentives for the voluntary use of innovative wood construction materials.",2017
Environmental Compatibility of Lightweight Aggregates from Mine Tailings and Industrial Byproducts,mine tailings; red mud; waste limestone; leachability; toxicity; lightweight aggregate,STEEL SLAG; ROAD CONSTRUCTION; DAPHNIA-MAGNA; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; LEACHABILITY; TOXICITY; IMPACTS; METALS,"A lightweight aggregate was produced by sintering the mixture of gold mine tailings, red mud, and limestone at 1150 degrees C. The physical (i.e., skid resistance, abrasion resistance, and bond strength) and environmental (i.e., leachability) feasibility of this aggregate was assessed to consider its potential use as a construction material for bicycle lanes. The skid resistance (British pendulum number of 71) and bond strength (1.5 N.mm(-2)) of the aggregate were found to be appropriate for this use. However, the abrasion loss value of the aggregate was found to be 290 mg, which exceeds the limit of Korean Standard KS F 281 (200 mg). Heavy metals were found to not leach from the aggregate in various leaching tests. These include Korean (Korea Standard Method for Solid Waste), American (Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP)), and European (BS EN 12457-1) leaching tests, despite the raw materials containing significant amounts of Pb, As, and F. However, leachate extracted from the aggregate exhibited an aquatic toxicity to Daphnia magna of 13.94 TU24hr and 14.25 TU48hr, most likely due to a high pH and Ca concentration originating from the free CaO present in the aggregate. The data suggests that the physical properties of the reconstructed aggregate are appropriate for use in bicycle lane construction, however the dissolution of Ca and the pH level of the leachate need to be controlled to protect aquatic ecosystems.",2017
Bond between concrete and reinforcement under high dynamic loading,,,"In addition to the well-planned loads during life-cicle in usual structures, buildings such as embassies, military infrastructure or nuclear power plants must withstand also threads like impact and explosion due to terrorist atacks. These dynamic loads are leading to high strain rates in the construction materials. It is well known, that the mechanical properties of concrete and steel as well as their interaction change with an increase of the loading rate. The knowledge of the rate dependent bond behavior is the condition for the nonlinear analysis of high-dynamic stressed reinforced structural components, if system reserves should be activated by the formation of plastic hinges, a sealing effect against fluids and gases has to be ensured and the crack width or the deformation should be limited. The bond behavior between steel and concrete under high loading rates has been investigated. Different test configurations have been developed and an extensive test program has been performed. The results served as a basis for the development of a model for the bond behavior, where the influence of high strain rates is considered.",2017

The scope of this research include the investigation of rural religious architectural values of Eskisehir, Gunyuzu, Kuzoren Village Mosque, and the restoration applications conducted at the mosque by Directorate General of Foundations in 2016. Kuzoren Village Mosque, dated to the late 19th early 20th century, has a rectangular (close to square) main prayer area, and an open late comers' portico with wooden pillars, on the north facade of the mosque. Rubble stone, wood, straw, earth and similar local material usage, interior dome and arches made of lath and plaster, wooden pillars and such traditional construction techniques, colored decorated interior space perception, and asymmetrical window arrangement are primary rural religious architectural values of the building. In the mosque, with rubble stone main body walls, especially at interior space elements such as women's section, minber, and ceiling, wood is the mostly used construction material. Although Kuzoren Village Mosque has been examined in terms of its architectural and art history in various literature, the data obtained during latest unspoken of restoration inventions introduced with this research. Further, with this research it is aimed to contribute to the rural religious architectural studies, which is a rarely studied field, by means of Kuzoren Village Mosque as an example of rural religious architecture with its local material usage, construction technique, and original architectural elements. Field works, literature, and archival research are the primary research methods used for this study.

Long Term Leaching Behavior of Antimony from MSWI Bottom Ash: Influence of Mineral Additives and of Organic Acids,MSWI bottom ash; Antimony; Leaching; Organic acids; Waste incineration,FINE-STRUCTURE SPECTROSCOPY; FLY-ASH; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; PORTLAND-CEMENT; CARBONATION; AGGREGATE; CONCRETE; LIGANDS; IMMOBILIZATION; TEMPERATURE,"The leaching of Sb in alkaline environment is known to be mainly governed by the precipitation of Ca- and Fe-antimonates. To reduce Sb leaching from MSWI bottom ash below the regulatory limit for recycling as construction material, Ca- and Fe-containing chemicals and industrial residues were added to this bottom ash. Short term and medium long term leaching tests were performed by lab batch tests and outdoor field tests. This confirmed that the tested chemicals and industrial residues reduce Sb leaching to below the regulatory limit. Carbonation tests with subsequent leaching were performed to provide information on the long term leaching behavior of Sb from MSWI bottom ash. Upon carbonation, Sb leaching from the bottom ash to which Fe-2(SO4)(3) or Ca- and Fe-containing industrial residues were added, increased over time, but did not exceed the regulatory limit value after full carbonation. When carbonation progressed, Sb leaching from the untreated bottom ash decreased, which could not be explained by the current state of the knowledge on mechanisms for Sb leaching in alkaline environments. As the leaching of Sb after carbonation was altered similarly as that of Cu, we experimentally checked if Sb leaching could also be influenced by the presence of organic acids,. As a result, we showed that Sb leaching from MSWI bottom ash in alkaline environments is indeed influenced by the presence of organic acids like humic and fulvic acids.",2017
"Radiological, Leaching, and Mechanical Properties of Cocombustion Fly Ash in Cements",Leaching; Radiological; Cocombustion fly ash; Petroleum pet coke; Cement,PETROLEUM COKE; COAL; QUALITY; IMPACT,"Wastes are used increasingly as construction materials to make the building industry more sustainable. In this regard, the European standards indicate the characteristics to be met by fly ashes used as cement replacement for the concrete manufacturing; such requirements dictate that the fly ash must not contain dangerous substances or to emit radiation. However, the tests to be performed are not indicated, nor are the maximum limits that cannot be exceeded. In this study, two different fly ashes are analyzed, one of which is obtained from the traditional coal combustion and the other from the cofiring of 70% by weight of petroleum coke and 30% of coal. Several mortar mixes with different compositions were manufactured, and chemical, physical, mechanical, leaching, and radiological tests were carried out on them. Both ashes satisfy the normative requirements about their chemical properties, volume stability, and setting time. The compressive strength of the cocombustion ash mortars was lower than those made with coal ash, although they showed a high strength activity comparable to that obtained for portland cement, in compositions up to 20%. Cements with cocombustion ashes as additive have not presented leaching nor radiological problems with regard to standards and recommendations. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2017
Life cycle assessment (LCA) of benchmark concrete products in Australia,Acidification; Cement; Concrete; Eutrophication; Global warming; Grout; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA); Mortar; Ozone layer depletion; Render,SOAKING TREATMENT METHOD; GENERAL-PURPOSE CEMENT; LIMESTONE CONTENT; RIGID PAVEMENTS; INVENTORIES; MANUFACTURE; PERFORMANCE; IMPROVEMENT; POTENTIALS; IMPACT,"A comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study was performed to investigate the environmental impacts associated with the manufacture of fourteen benchmark concrete products in Australia including concrete, mortar, grout and render. This study provides datasets for the reference cementitious construction materials which aid the construction industry to evaluate the environmental impact of construction more consistently. In addition, an appropriate formulation for the manual calculation of the environmental impacts of customised concrete mix-designs was investigated. Benchmark products were defined based on the average mix-design currently applied by the concrete industry and in compliance with the Australian cement and concrete standards. Normal and special grade concretes with strength in the range of 20 MPa to 100 MPa, mortars type M1 to M4, as well as grout and render were defined. The cradle-to-gate LCA model for each product was defined based on the ISO Standards 14040 and 14044 frameworks and in conjunction with modules A1 to A4 of European Standard EN 15804. GaBi software program version 7.2.2 was applied to ensure consistency and reproducibility of the environmental impacts for each product. The major impact classes were determined and discussed using Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) CML 2001 classification. Results showed that in all cases cement had the highest contribution to the impacts of concrete products. Using less cement in concrete products either by substitution of it with supplementary cementitious products or manufacturing cement with increased mineral additions has the potential to reduce environmental impacts. It was found that the Global Warming Potential (kg CO2-Eq per cubic metre) of the products ranged from 209 to 521 kg. Other regional environmental impacts, such as acidification, ozone layer depletion, and eutrophication, were also investigated and reported for each product. It was found that acidification was in the range of 0.670 to 1.609 kg SO2-Eq, and eutrophication was in the range of 0.108 to 0.259 kg Phosphate-Eq per cubic metre of concrete products in Australia. Establishing the industry reference point for cementitious products supports sustainability in production and enables tracking of future changes in the emissions of cementitious construction materials to ensure that concrete products are the responsible choice for construction. The decrease of cement clinker content through increasing mineral (limestone) addition is strongly suggested. In addition, the reported method for approximating environmental impacts of other concretes with customised mix-designs was found accurate and applicable.",2017

It is commonly disposed of in landfills. The use of cogeneration plants, and subsequently the quantity of ash generated and disposed, has increased significantly in India and other developing economies. Moreover, disposal of sugarcane bagasse ash causes environmental pollution and reduction of useful land area. A number of earlier research studies have reported on the excellent pozzolanic characteristics of sugarcane bagasse ash in concrete. The present study is focused on the performance evaluation of sugarcane bagasse ash as an ingredient in construction materials such as alkali-activated concrete, paver blocks, and unburnt bricks. Results from the study showed significant improvement in the characteristics, specifically strength and durability of bagasse ash blended specimens. Sugarcane bagasse ash and slag-based ambient-cured geopolymer specimens showed enhancement in compressive strength and workability in comparison with slag-based geopolymer. No efflorescence was observed in SCBA-based unburnt bricks, but water absorption in SCBA unburnt bricks was higher compared with fly ash bricks. Sugarcane bagasse ash blended paver block specimens exhibited significant resistance against water penetration and sorption compared with control specimens.

Degradation Process of Postconsumer Waste Bottle Fibers Used in Portland Cement-Based Composites,Waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles; Waste high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles; Degradation cement-based composite; Fiber reinforcement,RECYCLED PLASTIC AGGREGATE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PET FIBER; REINFORCED CEMENT; CONCRETE; MORTARS; CRACKING,"The degradation of synthetic fibers derived from postconsumer wastes and used in fiber-reinforced cement mortars was studied. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene postconsumer bottles were immersed in an alkaline medium of a 1-M solution of sodium hydroxide and portland cement paste. Then, the fibers' surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). This study showed that the fibers have a progressive surface deterioration over time when immersed in either of the two media. Degradation of fibers immersed in pozzolan-portland cement pastes was also observed. The results from the degradation process of these fibers show that it was stronger when they were immersed in the portland cement system (pH = 12.9), although the pH value was lower than that of the NaOH solution (pH = 13.8), suggesting that the degradation process in portland cement also depends on the formation of solid hydration products. The preliminary results of this study show overall good behavior of the studied fibers. This behavior generally improves when using pozzolans. Considering that fibers and pozzolans are obtained from wastes, and therefore have low economic and environmental costs, the possibility of using these materials in developing countries should be considered. The use of these wastes would, on the one hand, improve the properties of construction materials, and on the other, enable proper management of waste that could otherwise eventually pollute the environment.

Recycled glass as a supplementary filler material in spent coffee grounds geopolymers,Construction; Glass; Coffee grounds; Geopolymer; Recycling,FLY ASH GEOPOLYMER; PAVEMENT BASE/SUBBASE APPLICATIONS; BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; WASTE GLASS; CRUSHED GLASS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; S-H; STRENGTH; CONCRETE; AGGREGATE,"Recycled glass (RG) is a demolition waste, rich in silica and with a high shear strength and has been used as a replacement material for sand in various construction applications. Spent coffee grounds (CG) is a waste material derived from brewing coffee and has been recently studied as a recycled construction material, due to its physical resemblance to sandy soils. Geopolymerization, is a green process which produces cementitious compounds using aluminosilicate-rich materials and alkaline liquids. In this research, a new geopolymer construction material was produced using RG as a supplementary filler material to stabilize CG. Fly ash (FA) and slag were used as the precursors to induce geopolymerization in this new RG + CG construction product. To maximize the potential strength of the geopolymer, fine RG was added into geopolymer mixes in proportions of 25%, 50%, and 75% to observe the effects on the final RG + CG product strength. The mixes were compressed into cylindrical specimens, cured at room temperature (i.e., 21 degrees C) and 50 degrees C for 7 and 28 days, and tested for their unconfined compressive strength (UCS) to observe the effect of the various RG replacement ratio on the strength of CG geopolymers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to further explain the role of RG in influencing strength development. Higher RG contents were found to lead to higher UCS values. A lower liquid-to-precursor (L/P) ratio was required to achieve a saturation point in strength development. RG was found to provide mechanical strength and supplementary chemical bonding strengths by dissolving and contributing Si ions to form geopolymeric substances. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Potential use of reclaimed asphalt pavement and recycled concrete aggregate in base/subbase layers of flexible pavements,Pavement; Recycled material; Stresses; Resilient modulus; Constrained modulus,HOT MIX ASPHALT; CRUSHED GLASS; BASE LAYER; ROAD BASES; SUBBASE; CONSTRUCTION; MIXTURES; DEBRIS,"In current road and pavement engineering practices, the lack of fresh natural aggregate (granular material) supplies with increasing processing costs have led to use various reclaimed recycled materials from old structures as a source of construction materials. Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP), and Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) have been used as aggregates for pavement construction for some time. This study is focused on the characterization of blended materials containing 50% and 75% of RAP with fresh granular materials and RCA to evaluate whether they are suitable for granular base/subbase layers of flexible pavements. A series of laboratory tests was performed to determine the resilient modulus (M-R) and the constrained modulus (M-c) for both fresh granular materials and their blends. Statistically, the notable increase was found in the M-R values of the blended samples containing 75% RAP material and 25% fresh granular, particularly at higher levels of bulk stresses. It was also found that the accumulative strains during cyclic loading generally increase with an increase in the percentage of RAP contents in the blended samples. M-c test results show an increasing trend with the increasing level of axial stress, however, M-c value decreases with increasing percentage of the RAP content. Never-the-less, the t-test showed that accumulative strains during M-c tests were found to increase significantly with an increase in the percentage of RAP contents. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Properties of concrete containing polished granite waste as partial substitution of coarse aggregate,Polished granite waste; Abrasion; Water permeability; Compressive strength,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; DURABILITY; STRENGTH; MARBLE,"Disposal of solid waste materials is a great concern in, cities all around the world. Some of these waste materials are not biodegradable, which often leads to disposal crisis and environmental pollution. Many efforts are being made for the recycling of different types of solid wastes with a view to utilize them in the production of various construction materials. The granite stone industries produces vast amount of by-product rock waste and as a result, many residential and, agricultural areas are settled over the landfills which are basically composed of these waste materials. This paper reveals the use of polished granite waste from discarded tiles as a partial replacement for coarse aggregates in cement concrete. It was observed that the incorporation of polished granite waste in concrete decreases the compressive, flexural tensile and pull-off strength, while better results were observed for water absorption, abrasion and water permeability. The concrete containing polished granite waste, substituted up to 20% of natural coarse aggregate could be recommended for all applications and the substitution from 20% to 40% could be recommended for non-structural applications, pavement etc. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Tracing and imaging minor water seepage of concealed PVC pipe in a reinforced concrete wall by high-frequency ground penetrating radar,Water seepage; Ground penetrating radar; Water perturbation patterns,LEAK DETECTION; GPR; MOISTURE; REFLECTOMETRY; AMPLITUDE; SIGNAL; WAVE,"This paper studies the perturbation patterns of GPR images as a tool for tracing water seepage pathway in a plastic and concealed water pipe in a full-scale concrete wall specimen. Water seepage was triggered with a water circulation system and a pre-drilled hole (as seepage point) in a PVC pipe concealed in a concrete wall. Making use of a 2 GHz antenna, different GPR perturbations patterns on the PVC pipe (as weak scatterers) and several steel bars (as strong scatterers) in concrete, were mapped. The time-lapse changes of spatial spread and degree of water seepage were monitored for 59 days to trace the water seepage path. The perturbation patterns enable the observation of the wave attenuation explained by the well established theories of water in construction materials. Analysis in the validation experiment pushed the limit of GPR that the use of high-frequency GPR is potentially useful to trace and image minor degree of water seepage in concrete.

In this paper, the structural bending performance of post-tensioned, glass-FRP hybrid beams is evaluated by means of advanced Finite-Element (FE) numerical analyses. To this aim, a concise recapitulation of existing research on several typologies of glass-FRP hybrid beams is first provided. Based on earlier experimental and preliminary FE research outcomes, further detailed discussion is then proposed for the specific concept of glass-FRP post-tensioned glass beams. FE parametric simulations for quasi static bending loading configuration and room temperature are compared for such systems, typically including a laminated glass (LG) cross-section and an adhesively connected, post-tensioning FRP tendon, As shown, several aspects should be properly taken into account when investigating the overall performance of these systems, as far as both their elastic and post-cracked performance are highly sensitive to various mechanical and geometrical input parameters. A sensitivity FE study is hence presented, aiming to better explore their typical performance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
Development of a High Strength Geopolymer by Novel Solar Curing,Geopolymer; Solar curing; Fly ash; Activator; Early age strength,CALCIUM SILICATE HYDRATE; FLY ASH/SLAG PASTES; ASH GEOPOLYMER; CONCRETE; SLAG; GEL; COMPOSITE,"Geopolymer is a popular construction material derived from different sources of aluminosilicates known for its environmental benefits and excellent durability in harsh conditions. However, the curing of fly-ash based geopolymer normally requires a thermal treatment that increases the manufacturing cost and carbon footprint. This paper explored a new economical and environmentally-friendly alternative, i.e. solar curing, that harnesses solar radiation to achieve accelerated geopolymerization process. Geopolymer mortars coated in two different greyscales namely solar curing black (SCB) and 40% black (grey, SCG) were prepared to study the effect of solar radiation absorption ability on the strength of the specimens, along with ambient cured specimens (ATC) for comparison. Mechanical properties such as workability, compressive strength, stress-strain relationship from 1 day to 28 days were tested. The SCB specimens that can easily reach 65 degrees C under the sun showed a substantial improvement of the compressive strength especially at the early age, i.e. 49.2 MPa at 1-day compared with 25.5 MPa for the ATC ones. At 28-day, SCB reached 92 MPa in compressive strength which is 17.8% (13.9 MPa) higher than that of ATC. SCG showed a moderate enhancement in strength. Through in-depth physical and chemical characterizations, the structure and morphology of geopolymers were identified through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). It was found that geopolymer cured by solar radiation had more calcium aluminate silicate content hence leading to a higher mechanical strength. Furthermore, a titration study that determines the conversion rate of the activators inside geopolymers suggested a faster geopolymerization process in the solar cured specimens.",2017
Compressive strength and microstructural properties of spent coffee grounds-bagasse ash based geopolymers with slag supplements,Coffee grounds; Bagasse ash; Geopolymer; Recycling,BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; FLY-ASH; SUGARCANE BAGASSE; S-H; CONCRETE; CEMENT; CLAY; EMISSIONS; PRODUCTS; RESIDUES,"Spent coffee grounds (CG) is a beverage waste derived from the drinking coffee. Bagasse ash (BA) is the residue obtained from the burning of sugarcane for electricity. This paper aims to create and assess the feasibility of a recycled construction material formed by binding CG with a BA geopolymer, through the alkaline activation of BA using sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Slag (S), an industrial waste, was used to supplement CG+BA mixes. The mass ratios of the granular solids used were 70CG:30BA, 70CG:10BA:20S, 70CG:20BA:10S, and 70CG:30S. Strength development was assessed using the Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) test. Microstructural analyses were done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Specimens were cured at 21 degrees C and 50 degrees C, for durations of 7, 28, 60, and 90 days. This study found that 50 degrees C curing was necessary to adequately strengthen the mixes and inhibit organic content growth at long curing durations. Conclusively, this CG+BA geopolymer requires extended curing periods to achieve high UCS. The maximum recorded UCS in this study was 1482 kPa, achieved by 70CG:20BA:10S cured at 50 degrees C for 90 days. 70CG:20BA:10S provided the optimum aluminosilicate-to-alkali ratio for geopolymerization. Under optimum curing conditions, the geopolymer mixes were found to meet the minimum specified UCS requirements for subgrade materials in various countries. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Predicted mechanical performance of pultruded FRP material under severe temperature duress,,RESIDUAL STRENGTH; CONCRETE; SUSTAINABILITY,"Pultruded FRP (fibre reinforced polymer) materials have attracted the attention of civil engineers with their high strength weight ratio and environmentally friendly production and use. Mechanical analysis of pultruded FRP profiles is complex since the material is anisotropic and becomes more complex when thin FRP dedicated hollow cross sections are involved. This is particularly relevant with square or rectangular construction forms where the corners of the material are suspected to produce weak points under compressive loading. FRPs are also believed to behave contrarily when subjected to heat and thermal duress. This research investigates problems in predicting their behaviour under compression (hollow square pultruded FRP sample) using different analytical and modelling approaches. The mechanical behaviour of the material is investigated under different thermal conditions through finite element simulation and the results are then compared with previously conducted laboratory research analysis. The large deformation in anisotropic materials is simulated to provide better prediction regarding the failure mechanism of this material. Finite element simulation is then used to estimate the performance of similar and often competitive construction materials to GFRP (i.e.: wood, concrete and steel) under similar thermal and compressive duress.

Spent fluorescent lamp glass as a substitute for fine aggregate in cement mortar,Fluorescent glass; Cement mortar; Mercury leaching; Properties; Recycling,CRT FUNNEL GLASS; RAY TUBE GLASS; WASTE GLASS; CONCRETE; MANAGEMENT,"In recent years, recycled waste materials have been widely used to produce construction materials in an effort to reduce the utilization of natural resources and post-consumer wastes entering landfills. In this paper, the results of an experimental programme on studying the feasible use of spent fluorescent glass (FG) as a fine aggregate replacement in cement mortar are presented. Two types of FG were adopted in this study, one with (FG-A) and one without (FG-B) heating treatment at around 375 degrees C, to ensure the removal of mercury within the broken FG. The use of FG up to 40% to replace sand showed no obvious difference in density, but demonstrated an enhancement in workability and less shrinkage in the cement mortar. In comparison, the reduction of mechanical strength for a given content of FG-A usage in mortar is relatively lower than that of FG-B. This could be due to the FG-A (after the heating treatment) being free from the organic lacquer and the smooth coating, resulting in a better bond with the cement paste matrix. All the FG samples experienced big length changes due to the alkali-silica reaction (ASR), associated with their high solubility and the original microcracks present in the interior of the thin FG particles. The Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) results indicated that utilizing of both FG-A and FG-B in the cement mortar could effectively reduce the leachability of mercury, from 12.99 mg/L and 70.55 mg/L (determined original FG-A and FG-B values before they were incorporated into the cement mortar) to below the permissible limit of 0.5 mg/L. However, the replacement ratio of FG should be limited to 30% or below. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
A comparative analysis of embodied carbon in high-rise buildings regarding different design parameters,Building height; Construction material; Embodied carbon; High-rise building; Recycled material; Structural form,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT,"The building sector accounts for one third of the global greenhouse gas emissions, of which a substantial amount is embodied carbon from construction material production. While previous studies concentrated on analyzing the carbon emissions of low-rise buildings, they have overlooked high-rise buildings, which also have large impacts on the carbon emissions of a city. Moreover, high-rise buildings use different construction materials and structural forms, resulting in large variability in their embodied carbon estimates. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the relationships between different design parameters and the embodied carbon in high-rise buildings. The results serve as a basis for making more environmentally-sustainable decisions when designing high-rise buildings in order to reduce the carbon emissions from the building sector. Different high-rise buildings are designed by varying the construction materials (namely reinforced concrete, structural steel and composite materials), recycled contents (steel scrap and cement substitutes), structural forms (i.e., core-frame, core-outrigger, tube-in-tube and mega-brace) and building heights. The embodied carbon values are evaluated and compared, by considering the carbon emissions from material manufacture and transportation. Given the same structural form and building height, steel buildings have 50-60% less total weight, but 25-30% more embodied carbon than composite and reinforced concrete buildings. If 80% of the steel used in buildings is recycled, the embodied carbon in steel buildings is reduced by around 60% and becomes the least among all buildings. The embodied carbon per floor area against building height follows a concave upward trend, indicating that each structural form has a suggested height range where embodied carbon is minimum. When the building height exceeds the suggested height range, the structural efficiency of the building decreases with considerable growths in material demand and embodied carbon.

Analysis and comparison of environmental impacts and cost of bio-based house versus concrete house,Bio-based house; Concrete house; Environmental impact; Cost; BIM; Energy analysis,,"In order to reduce the amount of energy being spent in the construction industry and to achieve the EU Climate and Energy Package goals by 2020, new ways of constructing houses is required. This research proposes construction of bio-based nearly zero energy or passive houses as one solution. Typical house construction methods in the Balkan region are analysed and compared to current Austrian house construction methods (in particular straw bale house built to passive house standards), since Austria is now one of the leading countries in Europe when it comes to offering smart and eco-friendly construction methods. This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the environmental performance of straw bale house in the Balkan region, develop the mainstream acceptance and use of straw as a construction material by proving that, such home is not only healthier for the environment, but also economically justifiable to construct than concrete/brick homes usually built in this region of the world. This is done via energy analysis in both BIM and Baubook software and construction cost calculation and comparison of two different house types virtually placed in Bosnia and Herzegovina as a representative country of Balkan region. Type 1 is bio-based house, while Type 2 is concrete house of similar geometry. During the analysis, it was discovered that Type 1 house is in compliance with passive house standards, while Type 2 isn't. Furthermore, energy use intensity according to BIM analysis for Type I is half of the value of the Type 2 house. Peak heating load for Type 2 house is much larger than for the Type 1 house. Global warming potential of Type 1 house is negative, which means that bio-based materials absorb CO2 during its life. Global warming potential for Type 2 is 435.02 kgCO(2)/m(2). In addition to this, it costs slightly less to construct Type 1 - house than Type 2 house. Therefore, this paper proves that Type 1 - Bio-based house is cheaper to construct and more energy efficient than Type 2 - Concrete house that is typically being constructed in the Balkan region.

Evaluating Mechanical Properties of Macro-Synthetic Fiber-Reinforced Concrete with Various Types and Contents,fiber reinforced concrete; compressive strength; elastic modulus; flexural strength,,"Concrete, as one of the most widely used construction materials, has a brittle behavior. Adding fibers with different types and contents would affect the ductility behavior and mechanical properties of concrete. Hence, an experimental study was conducted to investigate effects of type and content of polymer fibers on mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced concrete such as flexural strength, compressive strength, indirect tensile strength, and elastic modulus. In the present research, the concrete samples were made and, then, evaluated, using three different types of polymer fibers, including twisted, barchip, and fibrillated, with the contents of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 volume percentages, respectively. The results showed that by adding fibers to the concrete samples, the flexural and tensile strength was increased by 19.6-81.69% and 0.84-34.29%, respectively; besides, the addition of the fibers to concrete reduced the compressive strength and elasticity modulus by 4.57-26.32% and 12.48-37.08%, respectively. The concrete containing twisted and barchip fibers, despite the different types of fibers, had similar flexural performance.",2017
Self-Compacting Concrete in the Temple of Sagrada Familia,Self-compacting concrete; Sagrada Familia; Gaudi,EVOLUTION,"The Temple of Sagrada Familia presents singularities in terms of both the original design by architect Antoni Gaudi and the duration of the construction, which started more than 120 years ago. In fact, its design was conceived before the development of reinforced concrete. Therefore, the construction materials and processes have evolved to adapt new technologies without compromising the vision of Gaudi. This willingness to maintain the original designs has obliged the technicians to resolve details that were not defined in the project, including the issue of how to cast elements at great heights and with a high amount of reinforcement. In this context, the possibility of using self-compacting concrete (SCC) emerged. This paper describes the different experiences in the Temple of Sagrada Familia with SCC, from requirements that led to using this material to the design of the mixes and the casting of the elements in situ.

Evaluation of Transport Properties of Concrete Made With E-Waste Plastic,waste management; concrete technology; pollution; water absorption; E-waste,,"An experimental program was carried out to study the transport properties of concrete made with E-waste plastic (high impact polystyrene (HIPS)). The concrete was prepared with different percentages (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50) of HIPS as partial replacement of natural coarse aggregate by volume. The transport properties of concrete, such as water absorption and sorptivity, were investigated and results were reported. The percentage of water absorption of concrete with HIPS shows higher value compared to the control concrete. The increase in HIPS increases the water absorption of concrete but the values were within the permissible limit. The sorptivity values were increased with increase in HIPS content; all values were higher than control concrete; however, it decreased with increase in curing age. The sorptivity results were in line with that of water absorption results. Recycling of E-waste plastic (HIPS) as an aggregate in concrete as a new construction material may be one of the feasible solution to environment pollution, natural aggregate depletion and E-waste recycling.",2017
HYBRID BRIDGE STRUCTURES MADE OF FRP COMPOSITE AND CONCRETE,FRP composite; concrete; hybrid structures; bridges; shaping,,"Despite many advantages over the conventional construction materials, the contemporary development of FRP composites in bridge engineering is limited due to high initial cost, low stiffness (in case of glass fibers) and sudden composite failure mode. In order to reduce the given limitations, mixed (hybrid) solutions connecting the FRP composites and conventional construction materials, including concrete, have been tested in many countries for 20 years. Shaping the hybrid structures based on the attributes of particular materials, aims to increase stiffness and reduce cost without losing the carrying capacity, lightness and easiness of bridges that includes such hybrid girders, and to avoid the sudden dangerous failure mode. In the following article, the authors described examples of hybrid road bridges made of FRP composite and concrete within the time of 20 years and presented the first Polish hybrid FRP-concrete road bridge.

With these developments bring out new challenges on mainly construction materials. Hence, many studies ultimately reporting various waste management strategies which involves both eco efficient parameters. In the row, recent studies have been paid their focus on the construction materials which includes fine and course aggregates. Generally, the existing studies focused on alternatives for these construction aggregates, but still there is enough room to explore further.

Selection of Construction Project Taking into Account Technological and Organizational Risk,,FUZZY-LOGIC; CONCRETE,"During the implementation of construction projects, there is permanently a certain level of technological and organizational risk. This is due to the fact that the data on conditions for a construction project tend to have different levels of uncertainty. Even the projects of the same size and terms of implementation vary. The failure risk of individual works results from technological and organizational factors, such as, for example, the difficulty of technological execution of individual works; availability of construction materials; the difficulty of the organization of individual works; availability of qualified personnel, availability of necessary machinery and equipment in the technology, etc. These factors affect the time and the cost of construction projects. When taking into account their influence, while selecting an option for construction project, it is crucial to maintain the contractual cost and time.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a tool widely used to evaluate the environmental performance of buildings, materials and activities. Saudi Arabia has a rapidly growing construction sector with over $1 Trillion of ongoing projects. The housing sector, annually needing over 2.32 million new residential units in coming years, is yet to entertain environmental performance of buildings in its list of priorities. The present work undertakes a LCA study of a three-bedroom modern villa located in Dhahran. Providing the structural details of the villa, an account of the 18 main construction materials in terms of quantity and application has been produced. Embodied energy of these materials has been estimated adopting cradle-to-gate' approach. Environmental impacts of the materials have been modeled with the help of SimaPro software. The results suggest that concrete accounts for more than 43% of the total embodied energy of the house and is also the predominant material in terms of the overall environmental impacts.

For this reason, three types of mortar with the same mechanical strength class (R3 25 MPa, according to EN 1504-3) were tested and compared; they were based on CSA cement, an alkaline activated coal fly ash, and OPC. Firstly, binder pastes were prepared and their hydration was studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal-thermogravimetric (DT-TG) analyses. Afterwards, mortars were compared in terms of workability, dynamic modulus of elasticity, adhesion to red clay bricks, free and restrained drying shrinkage, water vapor permeability, capillary water absorption, and resistance to sulfate attack. DT-TG and XRD analyses evidenced the main reactive phases of the investigated binders involved in the hydration reactions. Moreover, the sulfoaluminate mortar showed the smallest free shrinkage and the highest restrained shrinkage, mainly due to its high dynamic modulus of elasticity. The pore size distribution of geopolymeric mortar was responsible for the lowest capillary water absorption at short times and for the highest permeability to water vapor and the greatest resistance to sulfate attack.",2017

The objective of this experimental study was to develop construction materials applicable to lightweight wall system by using ground granulated blast furnace slag and paper ash, which are industrial by-products. Specifically, we carried out an experimental research on the properties of a lightweight matrix that could have application to lightweight wall systems without involving any use of Portland cement that emits massive amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) from chemical process and burning fuel; the major culprit behind global warming. In this study, we used NaOH alkaline activator to achieve the strength of a ground granulated blast furnace slag-based matrix without using general Portland cement. As a result, the mechanism was uncovered as to how NaOH alkaline activator led to the generation of hydrogen gas through reaction with the unreacted Si of paper ash. In addition, we found that construction materials applicable to lightweight wall systems could be manufactured by using ground granulated blast furnace slag and paper ash, industrial by-products.",2017
Sludge quantification at water treatment plant and its management scenario,Water treatment sludge; Quantification; Sludge management; Reuse,WASTE; AGGREGATE; CEMENT; REUSE; BRICK; SOIL,"Large volume of sludge is generated at the water treatment plants during the purification of surface water for potable supplies. Handling and disposal of sludge require careful attention from civic bodies, plant operators, and environmentalists. Quantification of the sludge produced at the treatment plants is important to develop suitable management strategies for its economical and environment friendly disposal. Present study deals with the quantification of sludge using empirical relation between turbidity, suspended solids, and coagulant dosing. Seasonal variation has significant effect on the raw water quality received at the water treatment plants so forth sludge generation also varies. Yearly production of the sludge in a water treatment plant at Ghaziabad, India, is estimated to be 29,700 ton. Sustainable disposal of such a quantity of sludge is a challenging task under stringent environmental legislation. Several beneficial reuses of sludge in civil engineering and constructional work have been identified globally such as raw material in manufacturing cement, bricks, and artificial aggregates, as cementitious material, and sand substitute in preparing concrete and mortar. About 54 to 60% sand, 24 to 28% silt, and 16% clay constitute the sludge generated at the water treatment plant under investigation. Characteristics of the sludge are found suitable for its potential utilization as locally available construction material for safe disposal. An overview of the sustainable management scenario involving beneficial reuses of the sludge has also been presented.",2017

These 1100-1300 degrees C when heated in (shock method), they turn into a mass full of bubbles. The volume of gas output and aggregate increases about 5-6 times during expansion process. Expanded clay aggregates are preferred for lightweight construction materials because of both light and hard outer surface sintered. Such a choice because the reduction of dead load, but also has the advantage that the desired level of compressive strength. This study has studied to determine the expansion behavior of the clay samples taken from the Ankara-Kalecik Tekebel locality. About 3000 m2 clay pitch of 350 to 400 kg samples were taken from three different points of 1 mm were sieved off. Taken clay samples were passed through a 1 mm sieve.

Concrete samples (100*100*100 mm) were produced with this aggregate, and their compressive strength and specific bulk density were investigated. The aggregate subjected to heat treatment in 10 minutes at 1150 degrees C provided the desired properties. Because of a 3.2% of the expansion rate and density of 0.970 g / cm(3) and the independent spaces in the aggregate, it was observed that the produced aggregates are capable of floating on water. Furthermore, 28 day compressive strength and specific bulk density of concrete produced with expanded clay aggregates were 44, 9 MPa and 1,492 g/cm(3), respectively.",2017

Recently, it has been explored as a construction material. While works had been conducted on deploying biochar for road construction, there is an emerging trend of using biochar as concrete admixture. In comparison, using biochar this way will reduce more greenhouse gas emissions than if carbon is captured and sequestered through mineralization and deployment in construction. The use of biochar-containing construction materials to capture and then lock atmospheric carbon dioxide in buildings and structures can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 25%. In this review, attention was focused on evaluating biochar's capability for carbon adsorption, which depends on factors such as pyrolysis conditions (specifically, pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and pressure) and activation methods (and without surface modification).

Cracking is an unavoidable and inherent weakness of most cement-based construction materials including shotcrete. In this study, the effect of Bacillus Subtilis on healing and mechanical properties of shotcrete was evaluated. For this purpose, bacteria were introduced into mix design and curing solution in order to examine the effect of each approach on the compressive strength, tensile strength, permeability, porosity and healing of shotcrete specimens. The results of uniaxial compressive test showed up to 30% increase in the compressive strength of bacteria-exposed shotcrete specimens compared to control specimens. This strength improvement was 10% more in shotcrete specimens than in the conventional cast concrete specimens with the same mix design. The presence of bacteria, both in the mix design and curing solution, was found to enhance the tensile strength and decrease the water absorption and porosity of shotcrete. The maximum reduction in water permeability at 28 days was observed in the specimens cured in the bacteria-containing solution. The ability of bacteria to heal the cracks created in the specimens was also evaluated in the present work. Bacterial precipitation of calcium carbonate in the pores of specimens was confirmed by SEM/XRD analysis. The results give clear evidence supporting the utility of calcium carbonate precipitating bacteria for healing the cracks and improving the durability of shotcrete. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

BOF slag-bitumen mixes have shown better resilient moduli, rutting resistance, bonding and moisture damage resistance and stripping resistance than mixes with natural aggregates and they can also be high quality substitutes for natural aggregate in lower road pavement layers. Regrettably, most southern African specifications do not cater for slags resulting in limited BOF slag reuse hitherto. This may be due to observed pavement performance problems arising from some chemical constituents in this slag. Excessive free lime (f-CaO) and periclase (MgO) in slags react with water, resulting in large volume expansions which can lead to premature failure when used in roads. Aging treatment hydrates these oxides, thus ensuring allowable slag expansion. Low C3S and C2S contents in BOF slag make it a poor hydraulic binder. It may nonetheless, be used in soil stabilisation when activated by lime and other pozzolans. Heavy metals such as chromium, vanadium and nickel in the slag could potentially leach and pollute the environment. Assessment and monitoring of such elements are necessary for the environmental acceptance of using BOF slag in road pavements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
Moisture content influence on the thermal conductivity of insulating building materials made from date palm fibers mesh,Date palm fibers mesh; Mortar; Water content; Thermal conductivity; Theoretical models,THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; CEMENT COMPOSITES; CONCRETE; DENSITY; PERFORMANCES; ENVIRONMENT,"Vegetal fibers used alone or as additive in composite construction materials bear a growing interest owing to their several advantages such as their lightening and insulation effects. However, they are very hydrophilic. An experimental study was carried out on the water absorption and effect of humidity on thermal conductivity and density of binderless board of date palm fibers (DPF) mesh and a composite based on mortar reinforced with different percentage of DPF mesh varying from 0% to 51%. The obtained results show that the thermal conductivity and density of binderless board and composite increase significantly with volumetric water content. The incorporation of DPF mesh in the mortar has a positive effect, regardless of the water content of the composite, as it lowers its density (lightening effect) and decreases its thermal conductivity (insulation effect) owing to the increase of its total porosity. The addition of DPF to mortar lowers its water retention capacity related to the open porosity which is a positive effect when considering that trapped water increases the thermal conductivity of the insulating materials. The experimental findings on the evolution of thermal conductivity with water content of DPF mesh boards and MDPF composites were fitted to the theoretical models available in the literature. The best fitting models were used to identify the values of the intrinsic thermal conductivities of DPF and mortar. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
Introducing a curaua fiber reinforced cement-based composite with strain-hardening behavior,Curaua; Lignocellulosic fiber; Natural fiber composite; Strain-hardening; Engineered cementitious composites; Concrete,LIGNOCELLULOSIC FIBERS; MORPHOLOGY; BRAZIL; ECC,"Castable, cementitious short-fiber composites with ductile, strain-hardening behavior have been made using renewable curaua plant fiber. Using plant fiber reinforcement lowers the embodied energy of the material compared to that of previously reported strain-hardening cementitious composites, which have used synthetic, petroleum-based polymer fibers. In this study, physical, chemical, and mechanical characterization of the curaua fiber is conducted, followed by iterative design of curaua-reinforced cementitious composites. The aim of the research is to highlight and expand the range of functional uses for curaua fiber in construction applications, and to improve the sustainability of strain-hardening cementitious composites. Design challenges associated with using natural fibers in place of synthetic fibers in cement mortar matrices including water absorption and disparate physical characteristics leading to weak fiber matrix interfacial bonding were addressed with silane coupling agent and mechanical fiber debundling treatments. The resultant curaua-reinforced composites are promising construction materials for building facade and cladding applications based on their lightweightedness, low thermal conductivity, and material toughness derived from a combination of tensile strength and tensile ductility.

Both groups included four mortar mixes containing Portland cement, sand, u-FA. Group 1 used RSS as a water replacement and Group 2 used water. Cement was replaced with 0, 10, 20 and 30% u-FA of total binder weight and one Liquid/Binder ratio of 0.8 was used. Mortar mixes were tested for their flowability, Total Water Absorption (TWA), Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV), compressive strength and drying shrinkage. The outcomes of the investigation were encouraging in that cement-based materials containing RSS demonstrated good engineering properties in comparison to the control mixes. The inclusion of u-FA significantly reduced flowability; however improved long-term compressive strength for both groups. The greatest compressive strength was recorded for the mixes with 10-20% u-FA replacement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
Recycled plastic granules and demolition wastes as construction materials: Resilient moduli and strength characteristics,Plastic; Demolition; Waste; Recycling; Stiffness; Strength,DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; CONCRETE; AGGREGATE; PAVEMENT; SUBBASE; STATE; LLDPE,"Vast quantities of plastic and demolition wastes are generated annually by municipal and commercial industries in all developed and developing countries. The sustainable usage of recycled plastic and demolition wastes as alternative construction-materials has numerous environmental and economic advantages. New opportunities to recycle plastic and demolition wastes into alternative resource materials for construction industries would mitigate landfill issues and significantly reduce global carbon emissions. Infrastructure projects typically consume significant quantities of virgin quarry materials, hence the usage of plastic and demolition wastes as alternative construction materials will divert significant quantities of these wastes from landfills. In this research, three types of recycled plastic waste granules: Linear Low Density Polyethylene filled with Calcium Carbonate (LDCAL), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) were evaluated in blends with Crushed Brick (CB) and Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP). The blends prepared were evaluated in terms of strength, stiffness and resilient moduli. Resilient moduli prediction models were proposed using Repeated Load Triaxial (RLT) tests to characterize the stiffness properties of the plastic/demolition waste blends. Polyethylene plastic granules with up to 5% content were found to be suitable as a road construction material, when blended in supplementary amounts with demolition wastes. This research is significant, as the usage of plastics as a construction material, in combination with demolition wastes will expedite the adoption of recycled by-products by construction industries. Furthermore, the plastic blends were prepared without the requirement for any further operations, such as reshaping plastic granules into fibers, hence leading to significant energy and costs savings.

Strain hardening cementitious composites incorporating high volumes of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash,Incineration fly ash; IFA; Strain hardening cementitious composites; SHCC; Friedel's salt,BLENDED CEMENT; HEAVY-METALS; CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR,"This paper reports the potential use of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (IFA) as cement supplement for the production of strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCC). Results showed that IFA is not a conventional pozzolan according to ASTM C618. Certain chemical reaction; however, occurred when IFA is used together with cement as evidenced by the formation of Friedel's salt in IFA-SHCCs. As a result, the compressive strength as well as tensile ductility of IFA-SHCCs can be maintained when up to 20% cement was replaced by IFA. At higher replacement level, however, excessive alkali metal chloride may leach out from the matrix leading to porous honeycomb microstructure of matrix which results in reduced compressive strength but enhanced tensile ductility of IFA-SHCCs. Leaching tests showed that almost all heavy metals concentration complied with the limits set in the Dutch Soil Quality Decree for construction materials. This suggests SHCC binder can effectively immobilize heavy metals in IFA potentially due to the low water-to-binder ratio of IFA-SHCCs matrix. Preliminary evaluation indicates that IFA may be used to replace cement in the production of SHCC. Further studies are necessary to investigate the long-term environmental impact of IFA-SHCCs.

This paper presents the strength characteristics of geopolymer concrete (GPC) developed with fly ash and GGBS as binders, combined Sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) solution as alkaline activators. The parameters considered in this research work are proportions of fly ash and GGBS (70-30 and 50-50), curing conditions (Outdoor curing and oven curing at 600 degrees C for 24 hours), two grades of concrete (GPC20 and GPC50). The mechanical properties such as compressive strength, split tensile strength and flexural strength along with durability characteristics were determined. For studying the durability characteristics of geopolymer concrete 5% H2SO4 solutions was used and the specimens were immersed up to an exposure period of 56 days. The main parameters considered in this study were Acid Mass Loss Factor (AMLF), Acid Strength Loss Factor (ASLF) and products of degradation.

These composite materials are a combination of matrix and textile materials. There isn't much research done about the usage of polymer modified matrices in textile reinforced cementitious composites. In this study, matrix materials named as fine grained concretes (d(max) <= 1.0 mm) were investigated. Air entraining effect of polymer modifiers were analyzed and air void content of fine grained concretes were identified with different methods. Aim of this research is to study the effect of polymer modification on the air content of fine grained concretes and the role of defoamer in controlling it. Polymer modifiers caused excessive air entrainment in all mixtures and defoamer material successfully lowered down the air content in all mixtures. Latex polymer modified mixtures had higher air content than redispersible powder modified ones. Air void analysis test was performed on selected mixtures. Air void parameters were compared with the values taken from air content meter. Close results were obtained with tests and air void analysis test found to be useful and applicable to fine grained concretes. Air void content in polymer modified matrix material used in TRCC found significant because of affecting mechanical and permeability parameters directly.",2017
Assessment of attached and unattached progeny concentrations of Rn-222/(220) Rn and their contribution to dose using deposition-based progeny sensors,Attached and unattached progeny; Building materials; LR-115 type-II; Progeny sensors; Unattached fraction,INDOOR RADON CONCENTRATION; THORON DECAY PRODUCTS; LUNG-CANCER; WIRE SCREEN; FRACTION; DWELLINGS; INDIA; EXPOSURE; HIMALAYA; AIR,"The exposure of radiation from natural sources to population has become an important issue in terms of radiological protection. Mostly natural radiation comes from radon ((222) Rn), thoron (Rn-220) and their solidshortlived daughter products that are the main threat to public health risk. The results presented in this paper are from a survey carried out in 40 villages of Jammu district, Sub-Mountainous region of Jammu and Kashmir, India, to quantify progeny concentration of radon and thoron using a passive time integrating, deposition-based technique. For estimating the total (attached ? unattached) progeny concentration of radon/thoron, direct radon/thoron progeny sensors (DRPS/DTPS) have been used and only attached progeny concentration of radon/thoron has been measured by using wire-mesh capped direct radon/thoron progeny sensors (WM-DRPS/WM-DTPS). The study has been conducted for a period of 1 year during winter, rainy and summer seasons in all 112 dwellings. The exposure time of the sensors was 4 months. In this survey, the variability of progeny concentration of radon and thoron based upon variation in building construction materials and seasonswise has also been discussed and efforts have been made to provide the reason for these variations. The highest level of progeny concentration of radon/thoron was found in the mud-type dwellings compared with dwellings made of concrete, cement and marble. Indoor and outdoor gamma dose rate (mu Svh(-1)) has also been measured and correlated indoor gamma annual effective dose (mu Svy-1) with progeny annual effective dose (mu Svy(-1)).",2017
Thermo-mechanical characterization of construction material lightened by olive pomace,Porous materials; Lightened concrete; Thermo-mechanical properties; Moisture,PLANE SOURCE TECHNIQUE; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; BUILDING-MATERIALS; DIFFUSIVITY; MOISTURE; CAPACITY; DENSITY,"The development of porous materials requires a thorough knowledge of their physical properties. When used as thermal insulation, the properties that govern their insulating capacity are thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat. The presence of moisture, some of its origin, in buildings causes damage to walls that extend from the formation of mold in complete impregnation through the degradation of the thermal and mechanical performance. The major objective of this study is to determine the physical properties of a building material lightened by vegetable fiber (concrete pomace olive), used as an insulation bearer. Our goal is to develop and expand the field of use of these materials in construction. A judicious choice of additions proportions and implementation techniques will be considered. A particular interest is the thermal characteristics and mechanical strength, which is a decisive criterion for selecting a material in the construction. We determine the thermal conductivity of the materials studied with experimental equipment that allows us to make measurements of the thermal properties under actual use conditions (temperature and humidity) and also the study of the mechanical compressive strength of the materials studied and the interest in these materials is highlighted.",2017
Energy-efficient slum house using alternative materials,building information modelling (BIM); energy conservation; materials technology,BUILDINGS; ASH,"The development of permanent energy-efficient houses for ever-increasing urban slum dwellers using sustainable construction materials is a major challenge in developing countries such as India. The exposed building surfaces (walls and roof) play a significant role in controlling the peak cooling load demand in climatic zones where median temperatures are high. This study examines the baseline building model performance for peak cooling load demand using the traditional construction materials for walls (fly ash bricks) and roof (reinforced cement concrete (RCC)). As approved by standards and local government practice, the building plan for one-, two-and three-storied structures was modelled in Revit software. With the aim to achieve energy efficiency in a cost-effective manner over the base case model, bio-fuel ash cellular lightweight (BFA-CLW) bricks and expanded polystyrene geofoam (EPGF) as an insulator were analysed. Results indicate that the model with BFA-CLW bricks and an EPGF-RCC roof is energy efficient, cost competitive and would conserve peak cooling load as compared with the base case building model. It can be concluded that to enhance the energy efficiency of urban slum houses, the application of locally available novel sustainable products and a computational approach for faster design decisions should be practised.",2017

SAP samples intended for such use should be pre-tested with respect to their absorptivity as well as their kinetics of ab-and desorption prior to implementation in concrete or mortar. This not only reduces workloads in concrete laboratories in pre-testing modified cement-based mixtures but in fact discloses essentials of the eventual performance of the SAP in concrete and other cementitious materials. The review at hand outlines fundamentals of the thermodynamics of polymer chemistry as a basis for the sorptivity tests. The importance of the ionic composition of the test liquids and the interplay among expansive (swelling) and collapse-causing chemical forces in the hydrogel network are highlighted. Methods of free sorptivity testing in adequate saline solutions as well as absorbency determined subject to the application of external forces are summarised. Advantages and drawbacks of these methods are discussed, including a validation of anticipatory evaluations of SAPs' performance as admixtures in cement-based building materials. Apart from sorptivity pre-tests several methods of instrumental analytics for the chemical characterisation of SAP samples are drawn up, which represent standard approaches of polymer-chemical analytics.",2017
Method and application of characterisation of life cycle impact data of construction materials using geographic information systems,Buildings; Earthquake; GIS; LCA; Python; Regionalisation; Transport distance; Wind,ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION; LAND-USE; UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS; GIS; LCA; BIODIVERSITY; SENSITIVITY; ASSESSMENTS; BUILDINGS,"Purpose This research presents a methodology to characterize life cycle impact data (LCIA) of alternative construction materials outside of the European context. Methods This methodology was based on the characterization of data and life cycle assessment (LCA) using geographic information systems (GIS), which has been proposed as an effective alternative for this purpose. The data were characterized at three levels: global, represented by different production efficiency of materials; regional, represented by the type of electricity mix used in the production and the national transport at the country level; and local, represented by external factors, such as seismic and wind risk zones at the city level. A comparative LCA was used as case study to test the methodology. The functional unit for the LCA was defined as an 18 m(2) core shelter unit consisting of structural elements only. The bill of materials for five designs were calculated, each using a distinctive construction material: bamboo, brick, concrete hollow block, ferro-cement panels, and soil-stabilised bricks. The contributions' variability and uncertainty analysis were used to validate the consistency of the results. The effect of the external constraints (earthquakes and wind) were analysed, and the environmental impact over the whole life cycle was assessed. Five house designs were calculated in twenty locations based on three levels of production efficiency and three transport distance ranges for each country. Results and discussion The results of the bamboo, concrete hollow block and ferro-cement houses overlapped and changed depending on the construction materials' transport distance. Therefore, the level of impact of an average bamboo house can also be achieved by a high-performance block or ferro-cement house. The results showed that in most cases, the buildings with high technical performance can be achieved with low environmental impacts. Conclusions The use of GIS enables the development of characterized LCIA data for construction materials and buildings with a high degree of consistency. Moreover, the proposed approach was able to accurately represent the range of production practices used outside Europe. Finally, the use of the proposed methodology allows for the assessment of building in the early stages of design when uncertainty is at its highest, thereby identifying the improvement potential of each design and recognising the structural needs in specific locations.",2017
Challenges in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of stabilised clay-based construction materials,Clay; Life Cycle Analysis; Stabilisation; Soil; Cementation; Sustainability,,"The preference of clay-based materials for sustainable construction is well-established. The establishment of sustainability credentials of emergent construction materials is very subjective, and most available tools are not fully equipped to deal with individual material systems, such as composite cement- or lime-based cementitious systems, including clay-based blocks and bricks. The main problem emanates from the challenges of the audit of each aspect of the material processing, and especially the quantification of the most relevant inputs into the composite product. The variability in material ingredients, and lack of data for each aspect of the manufacturing processes involved creates major challenges. Incorporation of materials with long and complex recycling processes further exacerbate the challenge. These incorporations create problems in terms of accurate material trails and data for input in a robust Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of individual products. This paper reports on a simplified approach towards full LCA of seven clay-based brick products developed in UK (4) and Spain (3), based on known material data and estimated energy inputs in the manufacturing processes. The UK-based bricks comprise of Lower Oxford Clay (LOC), stabilised using combinations of hydrated lime, Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag (GGBS) and Portland cement (PC). In order to test the robustness of the proposed approach, results on UK-based bricks are compared with a parallel LCA on clay-based product developed in Spain. Finally, the clay-based products are compared with a typical Portland cement-based concrete block and fired clay brick. In the LCA, boundary conditions include fixed transport, thus attempting to factor only the material ingredients, their known atmospheric emissions, and estimated energy inputs during processing. Results suggest that the most challenging aspect in the undertaking of LCA is the availability of reliable input data. Results also show that there are numerous parameters that can reliably and corroboratively facilitate the comparison of performance, besides carbon dioxide emissions.",2017
Assessment of self-sensing capability of Engineered Cementitious Composites within the elastic and plastic ranges of cyclic flexural loading,Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC); Self-sensing; Cyclic loading; Carbon-based materials,HEALING CAPABILITY; REINFORCED CEMENT; CONCRETE; COMPRESSION; SENSORS,"Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) are emerging construction materials with proven mechanical and durability characteristics. These outstanding properties make the material an attractive choice for different infrastructure types. But the growing use of ECCs brings about the need to monitor the health of the structures that employ them. This study therefore focused on the self-sensing capability of ECC with different carbon-based materials (multi-walled carbon nanotubes [CNT], graphene nanoplatelets [GNP], carbon black [CB] and carbon fibers [CM when subjected to repetitive loading and unloading cycles within the elastic and plastic ranges. Tests were conducted on beam specimens loaded and unloaded under four-point bending loading. Within the elastic range, 30% of the ultimate flexural strength was decided for application on the tested specimens. For the plastic range, prismatic specimens prepared for cyclic flexural loading at high levels were loaded up to 70% of their ultimate flexural strength. Experimental findings showed that for all proposed ECC mixtures, self-sensing of imposed damage (i.e. loading) was successful for both elastic and plastic ranges, while the self-sensing of load removal (i.e. unloading) in the elastic range was not achieved as successfully. This was most probably due to very small imposed damage and continuously increasing intrinsic electrical resistivity of individual carbon based materials under loading, which cannot be discharged upon unloading. Compared to other carbon-based materials, CF utilization during ECC production was the most effective method for self sensing of cyclic loading and unloading in the elastic and plastic ranges. Improving the proven superior mechanical and durability properties of ECC materials with self-sensing characteristic will multiply the benefits for truly sustainable infrastructures.

Long-Term Performance of Recycled Concrete Aggregate for Subsurface Drainage,,PRECIPITATION,"Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is one of many sustainable construction materials, and its use in drainage systems by replacing virgin aggregate is beneficial from both economic and environmental perspectives. However, the use of RCA as pipe backfill material may cause a long-term performance issue such as clogging due to fine accumulation and calcite precipitation on filter fabric. Therefore, this study investigated long-term performance of RCA regarding flow rate and calcite precipitation. Long-term permeability testing was conducted to measure the reduction of flow rate with time, and the effect of filter fabric's opening size on the flow was also evaluated. Additionally, an accelerated calcite precipitation (ACP) procedure was devised and used to estimate lifetime calcite precipitation of RCA. Two key findings are: (1)excessive RCA fine accumulation can cause significant reduction in RCA's drainage performance; and (2)the clogging due to calcite precipitation of RCA may not be as significant as the existing and/or accumulated RCA fine.",2017
Modification of traditional Chinese ginger nut and its mechanical behavior,Chinese ginger nut; Modification method; Mechanical properties,HYDRAULIC LIME MORTARS; DURABILITY; TECHNOLOGY; BUILDINGS; MASONRY; CEMENT,"The ginger nut has been used as building materials in Dadiwan site in Qin'an County, Gansu Province, China, and it was confirmed as the earliest lightweight concrete in China. However, the ginger nut is not a proper construction material because it does not contain cementitious components. In this paper, original ginger nut were calcined under different temperatures and the properties of the resultant modified ginger nut were analyzed. 1100 degrees C was chosen as optimal calcination temperature according to CaO, beta-CaSiO3 and Ca2Al2SiO7 content. Based on mortar workability and strength as result of curing time, 0.33 was selected as the optimal water binder ratio of the ginger nut mortar. The results of the mechanical tests revealed that the mortar exhibited ductile behavior, and it is possibly due to the special structure between aggregates and hydration or carbonation products. Finally, several tests carried out to determine weathering resistance abilities of the ginger nut mortar showed that they will probably serve as restoration material for stone or soil relics.

Dynamic simulation of unrestrained interlocking Tuned Liquid Damper blocks,Masonry block; Damping ratio; Frequency ratio; Transmissibility ratio; Tuned Liquid Damper,MASONRY WALLS,"The objective of the study is to develop a new construction material as an alternative for expensive dampers. A Tuned Liquid Damper (TLD) system that is cast in a concrete masonry unit has been proposed. The block has been examined in its individual characteristics to consider the resonant effect of the building subjected to a wide range of water depth, d(w), from 5 mm to 80 mm. The TLD block was designed to internal dimensions of 190 mm (length) x 60 mm (width) x 90 mm (height) in accordance to the Uniform Building Code (UBC) and Eurocode 8. Sine-sweep responses results were plotted in transmissibility ratio, u(t)/u(g) to frequency ratio, omega/omega(n). The block at a depth of d(W) was simulated and empirically calculated. Tests for dw of 50 mm, 60 mm, and 70 mm have verified the fundamental frequency, f(n) to be similar with the simulated and calculated eigenvalues. Further study of the combined structural model and TLD blocks test as a system has been compared with the numerical simulations. The results varied by approximately 2%. The system has recorded reduction of responses immediately at the test of dw, 5-80 mm. Optimum performance has been recorded at 60 mm. The test results employed half-power bandwidth to obtain the damping ratio. The damping has been contributed by both viscous damping component and inertia of the moving water body. The Rayleigh stiffness damping component has not been identified to participate in the forced excitation performance reduction. It was found that the new innovative block with tuned liquid can significantly increase the damping characteristics. Hence, the research is necessary to propose an alternative new construction material to withstand earthquake and wind disasters on buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
A general method for retrieving thermal deformation properties of microencapsulated phase change materials or other particulate inclusions in cementitious composites,Effective medium approximations; Micromechanical modeling; Property measurement; Phase change materials; Construction materials; Cementitious composites,EXPANSION; CONCRETE; LIMESTONE; CRACKING; MODULI,"This study examined the effects of spherical core-shell particle inclusions, such as microencapsulated phase change materials (PCMs), on the thermal deformation behavior of cement-based composites. First, simulations of volumetric thermal deformation in representative microstructures were carried out, based on the finite element method (FEM), to predict the effective thermal deformation coefficient of the composites. Excellent agreement was found between the effective thermal deformation coefficient predicted by FEM and by the effective medium approximation (EMA) developed by Schapery (1968). Furthermore, the effective thermal deformation coefficient of cementitious composites with either microencapsulated PCM or quartz particulates was measured. The measured effective thermal deformation coefficients together with Schapery's model were used to retrieve the thermal deformation coefficients of the inclusions themselves. The thermal deformation coefficient of PCM microcapsules was estimated to be similar to that of the shell component due to partial filling of the microcapsules. The results show a means for (i) retrieving the thermal deformation properties of functional core-shell inclusions and (ii) for designing cementitious composites with PCMs which find use in the built environment and high-performance composites.",2017

Concrete mixtures were prepared containing 0, 20, 50, 75 and 100% of BA as a substitute for river sand and 20% of FA as a replacement for OPC. Tests carried out were Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP), sulfate and acid attack (change in compressive strength, microstructure and weight) and elevated temperature effects (loss in compressive strength and mass as well as change in pulse velocity). Results showed that submerging coal ash concrete (CAC) mixtures in 5% sulfuric acid solution resulted in less reduction of compressive strength and mass loss compare to that of the control concrete. Moreover, sulfate resistance tests on concrete mixtures indicated that there were no mass loss and no reduction in compressive strength of all the mixtures after submersion in 5% magnesium sulfate solution. CAC showed higher weight loss and greater compressive strength reduction at elevated temperatures. From TCLP results, it is concluded that none of the elements leached higher than the maximum concentration of contaminants for toxicity characteristics. It indicates that transportation, disposal and utilization of BA and FA as clean construction material's replacement could be utilized to reduce their environmental problems, increase efficiency and reduced unit cost production of concrete.

Sustainable transformation of fly ash industrial waste into a construction cement blend via CO2 carbonation,Carbon dioxide; CO2 utilization; Green cement; Carbonation; Fly ash; Sequestration,MINERAL CARBONATION; STEEL SLAG; ACCELERATED CARBONATION; AQUEOUS CARBONATION; SEQUESTRATION; STORAGE; CONCRETE; LIME,"This study investigates the potential approach of utilising CO2 to produce carbonated fly ash (CFA) in a cement blend for new 'green' construction materials. The aqueous fly ash (FA) carbonation experiments are performed in a batch bench-scale glass reactor to study the effect of different CO2 flow rates (of 2 and 4 ml/min) and water-to-FA ratios (15 and 7.5 ml/g) on the carbonation process. A longer carbonation time is obtained for the water-to-solid ratio of 7.5 ml/g compared with 15 ml/g at the same CO2 flowrate while a faster carbonation process is achieved at higher CO2 flowrate at the same solid dosage. The maximum carbonation efficiency of 16.9% is calculated for water-to-solid ratio of 15 ml/g based on the variation in the Ca2+ ions concentration in the liquid phase. However, using the carbonate content of the solid samples results in a much higher carbonation efficiency of 83.5% corresponding to a final CO2 uptake of around 3.2%, i.e. 32 g CO2/kg FA. The CFA is then used to prepare cement paste blends in which Portland cement (PC) is replaced with CFA at different replacement levels of 10 and 30% (w/w) using the water-to-cementitious material ratio of 0.4. Mechanical strengths of CFA-PC mortars, cured for 14 days under ambient conditions, are compared with those prepared from pure PC in order to investigate the effect of FA pre-carbonation on the performance of green cement with low-carbon footprint. The results show that the CFA-PC mortars containing 10% CFA has slightly lower compressive strength than that of the pure cement, however with increasing the CFA replacement level to 30%, significant reduction in the compressive strength of mortars is observed.

In this investigation, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) has been used to produce geopolymer cement (GPC) at ambient temperature and at about 100% relative humidity, the influence of replacing slag by 5 and 10% of fly ash or clay-bricks wastes (Homra) as well as the effect of sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide ratio (SS:SH) in the alkaline activator solution on the properties of the produced geopolymer have been investigated. This was done through measurement of compressive strength values, water absorption as well as performing FTIR spectra, XRD patterns and SEM imaging. From the experimental results, the optimum percentage replacement of GGBS with FA or Homra is 5%. Besides, the optimum SS: SH ratio is 1 by weight, while 0.5 ratio produces the lowest compressive strength and higher water absorption values. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017
Mechanical and electrical properties of cement paste incorporated with pitch-based carbon fiber,pitch-based carbon fiber; compressive strength; electrical resistance; polarization; cement paste,MATRIX COMPOSITES; MESOPHASE PITCH; LATEX,"The compressive strength and electrical resistance of pitch-based carbon fiber (CF) in cementitious materials are explored to determine the feasibility of its use as a functional material in construction. The most widely used CFs are manufactured from polyacrylonitrile (PAN-based CF). Alternatively, short CFs are obtained in an economical way using pitch as a precursor in a melt-blown process (pitch-based CF), which is cheaper and more eco-friendly method because this pitch-based CF is basically recycled from petroleum residue. In the construction field, PAN-based CFs in the form of fabric are used for rehabilitation purposes to reinforce concrete slabs and piers because of their high mechanical properties. However, studies have revealed that construction materials with pitch-based CF are not popular. This study explores the compressive strength and electrical resistances of a cement paste prism using pitch-based CF.",2017

Composites containing different amounts of PET particles, as partial replacement to cement by weight, were characterized by destructive and non-destructive testing. So, the thermal conductivity, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and sorptivity coefficients of composite made up of mixtures of PET polymer were measured; the adverse environmental conditions are simulated by using various acid solutions. The corrosion process was monitored by measuring the mass loss and compressive strength for different periods. The experimental investigation revealed that the addition of PET particles reduces the UPV; furthermore, thermal conductivity and sorptivity of the composites have been decreased. So, the decrease of the sorptivity-value is favorable to the durability of the specimen structures. On behalf of the resistance to aggressive environments, it was found that the course of action of acid attack is dependent on the type of acid and solubility of the calcium salt formed. The presence of PET was found to lower the detrimental effect of acids on composite. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction and FT-IR analyses were used to better understand the cement hydration products of the deteriorated mortars. In this way, the obtained PET-mortar composites would appear to be low-cost materials which would contribute to resolving some of the solid waste problems in addition to conserving energy.",2017
Alien plant species establishment is associated with reduced soil acidity in the vicinity of concrete block structures,alien species; disturbance; pH; Pine Barrens; species richness,INVASION; COMMUNITIES; MECHANISMS,"We hypothesized that in the oligotrophic, acid soils of the New Jersey Pine Barrens, where native diversity and invasability appear to be low, the weathering of concrete block construction material over time has reduced resistance to plant species' invasion by reducing soil acidity. We also sought to determine whether alien species' success in disturbed Pine Barrens soil differs from that of the non-Pine Barrens North American plant species whose presence in the region is associated with anthropogenic soil disturbance. In the field, species richness of native Pine Barrens species, non-Pine Barrens species, and alien species was determined along with current-year aboveground biomass production and soil pH along transects extending from concrete block buildings and from paired control transects without concrete block buildings. Soil inorganic nitrogen was measured near and far from buildings. Additionally, a pot study using native soil amended with ground concrete was conducted to determine its effect on pore-water pH. Richness was significantly greater near buildings, with alien species concentrated within 6 m of buildings. Alien plant biomass was greater within 3 m of buildings than farther along the transects; however, productivity along the transects did not vary. Soil pH was elevated within 7.5 m of buildings and soil nitrate concentration was greater near buildings. The ground-concrete soil amendments were found to significantly elevate pore-water pH. We conclude that disturbed habitats with acid soil conditions possess a degree of ecosystem resistance to alien plant species establishment. However, this may be overcome by raising the soil pH.",2017

Experimental results show that carbonation can increase the diameter of impedance curve for all the cement-based materials. The type of cement-based material has great impact on carbonation process, which can be distinguished from the measured impedance spectrum. Functional relationships among charge transfer resistance, carbonation time, and carbonation depth are obtained, which can provide an effective way to predict the carbonation depth of various types of cement-based materials.

Due to the high concentrations and mobility of pollutants, bottom ash cannot readily replace virgin construction materials. Over the last decade, many research efforts have addressed these issues in view of newly developed engineering applications. However, the required quality of bottom ash varies for each application. In this review we focus on the ternary relationship between engineering applications, chemical barriers/limitations and treatment technologies for municipal solid waste incinerator bottom ash. For each intended engineering application [loose(bulk) construction aggregates; sand, aggregate or cement replacement in concrete; raw material for cement or ceramics] the appropriate treatment technologies are selected to overcome identified chemical barriers. This allows future top-down design decisions, starting from the most promising engineering application of bottom ash. The main chemical barrier for bottom ash recycling as loose construction aggregates is the leaching of heavy metals and/or metalloids. This can be overcome by size separation, carbonation, mild heat treatment or by using mineral additives. In structured concrete, the presence of metallic aluminum or zinc causes early cracking and a high chloride concentration causes corrosion of reinforcement steel. Therefore, recent developments in wet/semi-dry separations facilitated enhanced eddy current separation to remove non-ferrous metals. The washing of bottom ash to remove chloride, is to date the sole technology to prepare bottom ash as raw material for cement kilns. Finally, when bottom ash is used as feedstock for ceramics production, recent knowledge was generated to allow for selecting thermal process parameters in such a way that leaching of both heavy metals and metalloids is minimized.",2017
How Does the European Recovery Target for Construction & Demolition Waste Affect Resource Management?,Recovery; Construction & demolition waste; Life cycle assessment; Resource efficiency,,"The revised EU Waste Framework Directive (WFD) includes a 70 % target for recovery of construction and demolition (C&D) waste. In order to study the potential change in the resource management of the main C&D waste fractions, as a consequence of fulfilling the WFD target, a Nordic project (ENCORT-CDW) has been performed. Waste fractions studied included asphalt, concrete, bricks, track ballast, gypsum-based construction materials and wood. Recovery scenarios were identified and estimations were made regarding expected savings of primary materials, impact on transport, and pollution and emissions. For wood waste, the main differences between re-use, material recycling and energy recovery were evaluated in a carbon footprint screening based on life cycle assessment methodology. The study concluded that the EU recovery target does not ensure a resource efficient and environmentally sustainable waste recovery in its present form since: It is very sensitive to how the legal definitions of waste and recovery are interpreted in the Member States. This means that certain construction material cycles might not count in the implementation reports while other, less efficient and environmentally safe, recovery processes of the same material will count. It is weight-based and consequently favours large and heavy waste streams. The result is that smaller flows with equal or larger resource efficiency and environmental benefit will be insignificant for reaching the target. It does not distinguish between the various recovery processes, meaning that resource efficient and environmentally safe recovery cannot be given priority. Improved knowledge on C&D waste generation and handling, as well as on content and emissions of dangerous substances, is required to achieve a sustainable recovery.",2017

To bridge this gap, in this study, SFRC panel specimens with panel thickness to projectile diameter ratios of 3.5 or smaller were tested to evaluate the impact resistance of SFRC. Test variables included the steel fiber volume fraction, panel thickness, size of coarse aggregates, and impact velocity. The test results were used to evaluate various impact design equations for plain concrete, and, also using the design equations, the test results were evaluated in depth.

ENVIRONMENTAL UTILITY OF WOOD SUBSTITUTION IN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS USING LIFE-CYCLE ANALYSIS,Life-cycle analysis; wood; commercial buildings; Athena Impact Estimator for Buildings; global warming potential,CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE; ENERGY; PERCEPTIONS; ARCHITECTS; BALANCES; TIMBER,"Wood is the predominant construction material in the US residential sector. In commercial and midrise construction, the use of wood is limited compared with reinforced concrete and steel. Wood, being a natural, renewable material that sequesters carbon, is a natural fit for newer construction with enhanced sustainability goals. The objective of this study is to evaluate and identify the environmental utility (avoided emissions) of using wood in place of steel and concrete in the commercial construction and renovation sectors in Oregon, United States. The study used comparative, cradle-to-grave, life-cycle analysis, with Athena Impact Estimator for Buildings. Six case studies that represent different building functionalities, material systems, and construction techniques were modeled via the user interface input option, and the results were evaluated for global warming potential (GWP) and impacts on energy sources, such as fossil fuel consumption, when structural materials are substituted using wood. Out of the six case studies, one building was completely redesigned as per current codes using wood as the major structural material. Bills of materials for both wood redesigns and the as-built designs were used as input in the software and subsequently analyzed. Results showed that the average reduction in GWP due to wood substitution was about 60% across the six case studies. These findings reinforce the perception of wood as a green building material having potential for commercial construction.",2017
A patent landscape on application of microorganisms in construction industry,Biocement; Cement; Concrete; Microorganisms; Mortar; Patent landscape,CARBONATE PRECIPITATION; CONTAMINATED SOIL; CEMENT INDUSTRY; CONCRETE; BIOREMEDIATION; BIOTECHNOLOGY; REMEDIATION; EMISSIONS,"Construction biotechnology includes research and development of construction materials and processes that make use of various microbes. The present technology landscape gives a perspective on how microbes have been used in construction industry as cement and concrete additives by analyzing patents filed in this technology arena. All patents related to the technology of interest published globally to date have been reviewed. The earliest patent filing in this technology domain was recorded in the year 1958 and the patenting activity reached its peak around mid to late 1990s. The early technology was mainly focused on microbial polysaccharides and other metabolic products as additives. Year 2002 onwards, biomineralization has taken precedence over the other technologies with consistent patent filings indicating a shift in innovation focus. Japan has been the global leader with highest number of patents filed on application of microbes in construction industry. Southeast University, China has topped the patent assignee list with maximum number of filings followed by Kajima Corp. and Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. Most patent applications have claimed microbe based bio-products. Construction-related microbial technologies are mainly based on activity of different microorganisms such as urease-producing, acidogenic, halophilic, alkaliphilic, nitrate and iron-reducing bacteria.

The development of Bayer derived geopolymers as artificial aggregates,Bayer process; Impurity removal; Bayer geopolymer; Artificial aggregate,RED MUD,"The Bayer process is the hydrometallurgical production of alumina, subsequently used within the chemicals industry and for smelting to aluminium. Bauxite deposits have with time become more problematic to process, frequently containing impurities that build up within the Bayer process liquor, reducing circuit efficiency and requiring dedicated reduction processes. The Bayer Circuit and residue washing processes are based upon the retention of the costly process liquor resulting in some impurities continuing to concentrate till they reach their solubility limits. A counter intuitive method of impurity removal is the export of a Bayer liquor bleed stream and its replacement with clean caustic. The Bayer liquor bleed stream would need to be of sufficient volume to act as an impurity removal process, but what to do with the costly and highly caustic aluminate solution? Following concentration, the Bayer liquor can be exported for utilisation in the production of Bayer derived geopolymers, a possible new construction material. Only the commercial application of the Bayer process liquor would allow the utilisation of the impurity removal process, potentially benefiting both industries. Bayer liquor and fly ash (a coal combustion product) have been utilised to make a new class of ambient-cured construction geopolymers with compressive strength in excess of 30 MPa. Industrial synergy allows for the production of Bayer derived flyash geopolymer products of very low embodied energy (concrete binder of 0.27 GJ/t) and associated carbon footprint. To establish a Bayer derived geopolymer industry of large enough volume to allow economies of scale, several product markets and applications will be required to generate consistent demand. One such market is to manufacture artificial aggregate from Bayer-derived geopolymer mortars. An artificial aggregate would normally have a high embodied energy however here it has been calculated to be 0.22 GJ/t, similar to other manufactured or recycled aggregates. Production rates could be between 0.1 and 10 million tonnes per annum per alumina refinery, depending upon local economics and refinery operational conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Towards sustainable concrete,,,"Every step in the life cycle of a material leaves a footprint on our planet. From the extraction or harvesting of raw materials to their conversion into familiar products, and then from the daily use of such products to their disposal, each phase has to be managed responsibly to avoid the risks related to the depletion of resources, increase in CO2 emissions and waste accumulation. Due to their large worldwide consumption, the environmental impact of some materials is particularly critical. For instance, concrete is one of the most important construction materials used in houses and infrastructure, where it is usually combined with metal alloys for structural reinforcement and decorative purposes. Metals are also used in a wide range of applications, from kitchen tools to vehicles and rocket engines. We asked experts in concrete research and metallurgy their opinions of the critical aspects related to the sustainable production, use and disposal of these materials, and their views on the strategies that are being adopted and may be further explored to decrease the environmental burden of these commodities. In the case of concrete, partial or complete replacement of one of its components, Portland cement, is essential to cut the CO2 emissions and energy consumption caused by its production. Defect engineering of metal alloys may be a viable approach to tune the mechanical response of structural materials without increasing the number of elements included in their composition.",2017
Integrating phase change materials into concrete through microencapsulation using cenospheres,Thermal energy storage; Phase change materials; Cenospheres; Microencapsulation; Concrete,THERMAL-ENERGY STORAGE; N-OCTADECANE; COMPOSITE; FABRICATION; BUILDINGS; AGGREGATE,"Phase change materials (PCMs) can enhance the building energy efficiency through thermal energy storage and thermal regulation. Microencapsulated PCMs (MEPCMs) provide a better utilization of PCMs with building materials. This study proposes a novel method to encapsulate PCMs into cenospheres which are hollow fly ash particles generated in coal burning power plants with size ranging from a few micrometers to hundreds of micrometers. The shell of the cenosphere inherently has some small pores which are sealed by a thin layer of glass-crystalline film. By removing this film through chemical etching, these holes can be exposed, providing paths for PCMs moving into the internal void of cenospheres. A thin layer of silica is coated on the PCM loaded cenospheres to prevent the possible leakage of liquid PCMs. The produced PCM microcapsules are referred to as CenoPCM, which can be directly added into traditional construction and building materials such as concrete to produce thermally active concrete. Prototype thermally active cement mortar integrated with the produced CenoPCM capsules have also been manufactured and characterized for its mechanical and microstructural properties. The characterizations showed that there was only minor reduction in strength and the mortar remained strong enough for building application. From this work, it is found that the produced CenoPCM capsules have great potential to be added into construction materials for reducing energy consumptions in buildings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the stress-strain behaviour of tie-confined self-compacting SCC is analysed and a comparison is made with SCC prepared without self-curing agents. The methodology included studying the stress-strain behaviour of two grades of self-compacting SCCs and comparing the results with normal SCC subjected to water curing and no curing. To determine the stress-strain behaviour, prism specimens were tested under axial compression. Lateral ties and longitudinal bars were used in the prisms and two grades of concrete of compressive strength were used.

Improved Image Unevenness Reduction and Thresholding Methods for Effective Asphalt X-Ray CT Image Segmentation,Asphalt pavements; Construction materials; Image techniques; Tomography; X-ray analysis,COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; ENTROPY; SELECTION; ALGORITHM; CONCRETE,"The internal structure of asphalt mixture revealed by X-ray computed tomography (CT) images provides useful information in a variety of civil engineering applications. This paper studied two image processing issues commonly encountered in asphalt X-ray CT images: image intensity unevenness caused by beam hardening effect and unrealistic image segmentation. Inspired by nonuniform illumination correction techniques, a grayscale morphological method is proposed to solve image intensity unevenness. Two modified multilevel thresholding methods are developed to effectively divide the asphalt CT images into three phasesair voids, binder, and aggregates. The comparisons of existing multilevel thresholding methods with the ones developed in this study indicate that the proposed methods provide more consistent, robust, and accurate results. Moreover, the developed thresholding objective functions enable a user to easily adjust thresholds to match visual examination or laboratory test results through modifying a single parameter. The developed methods help improve the analysis of asphalt CT images for various engineering applications. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2017
Comparison of environmental benchmarks of masonry and concrete structure based on a building model,Masonry; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon footprint; Embodied energy; Environmental benchmarks,EMBODIED ENERGY,"Construction materials have distinguished energy consumptions and different emissions of carbon dioxide from fabrication up to application. The processes and the treatments needed to transform the raw materials into the final products, the transport to the construction sites and the techniques used for their application, all contribute to the differences in embodied energy and carbon footprint of these materials. In an environmental assessment one wonders what kind of constructive solution is environmentally more favorable. This study refers to the environmental comparison of reinforced concrete and clay bricks. Through a digital three-dimensional building model the required data are analyzed. The building is once considered with a reinforced concrete structure, consisting of columns, beams and slabs, with brick walls in between the columns in the periphery and interior of the building. Then, structural masonry with clay blocks in the exterior and interior walls is studied. Both models are analyzed in two versions. In the first version the slabs are of reinforced concrete and in the second version the slabs are built in pre stressed concrete beams and clay blocks. The building model represents for all solutions equal conditions. The comparison is limited to the quantification of the most important environmental parameters, the embodied energy and CO2 emissions. The results of this study show that the Masonry Model Version 1 has a 11% reduction in CO2 and 12% reduction in energy consumption, while Version 2 of both models has a 39% reduction in CO2 emissions and 41% reduction in embodied energy in case of Masonry Model and 30% reduction in CO2 emissions and 32% embodied energy in case of the Concrete Model compared to the Concrete Model with reinforced concrete slabs. These differences are due to the reduction of reinforced concrete, which is more significant in Versions 2. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017

The environmental and economic aspects of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) containing concrete have led research studies to investigate the possibility of incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in concrete. Metakaolin (MK) is one SCM with high pozzolanic reactivity generated throughout the thermal activation of high purity kaolinite clay at a temperature ranging from 500 degrees C to 800 degrees C. Although many studies have evaluated the effect of MK on mechanical properties of concrete and have reported positive effects, limited articles are considering the effect of MK on durability properties of concrete. Considering the lifetime assessment of concrete structures, the durability of concrete has become of particular interest recently. In the present work, the influences of MK on mechanical and durability properties of concrete mixtures are evaluated. Various experiments such as slump flow test, compressive strength, water permeability, freeze and thaw cycles, rapid chloride penetration and surface resistivity tests were carried out to determine mechanical and durability properties of concretes. Concretes made with the incorporation of MK revealed better mechanical and durability properties compared to control concretes due to combined pozzolanic reactivity and the filler effect of MK.",2017
Estimation of reinforcing effects of FRP-PCM method on degraded tunnel linings,Degraded tunnel lining; FRP-PCM method; Direct shear test; Bending test; Numerical simulation,CONCRETE BEAMS; RC BEAMS; FLEXURAL BEHAVIOR; CFRP SHEETS; STEEL; PERFORMANCE; SHOTCRETE; CAPACITY; JOINTS,"Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) is a practical alternative construction material that has been extensively adopted in the reinforcement of concrete structures. The reinforcing effect of FRP grids needs to be quantitatively estimated when the grids are applied to degraded tunnel linings to assist with the maintenance design. In the present study, the reinforcing effect of FRP grids embedded in Polymer Cement Mortar (PCM) shotcrete (the FRP-PCM method) on degraded tunnels was estimated. Laboratory direct shear tests and bending tests were carried out on specimens reinforced with various grades of FRP grids to obtain the mechanical properties of the bonding surfaces between the PCM and the concrete reinforced by FRP grids. The bending test results showed that the bearing capacity of beams reinforced by FRP grids subjected to bending loads improved by around 40%. A numerical modeling of the reinforced tunnels by the FRP-PCM method was performed using the properties obtained from these laboratory tests to investigate the reinforcing performance of the FRP-PCM method on degraded tunnel linings. Numerical models with different loosening pressures acting on the tunnel lining, ground classes, degrees of lining deterioration, and degrees of tunnel health were considered, and the suitable conditions under which the application of the FRP-PCM method could effectively reinforce tunnel linings were proposed.

Methodology for the Assessment of the Ecotoxicological Potential of Construction Materials,cement-based; construction materials; ecotoxicology; assessment methodology; environmental risk,FLY ASHES; TOXICITY; CONCRETE; COMBUSTION,"Innovation in construction materials (CM) implies changing their composition by incorporating raw materials, usually non-traditional ones, which confer the desired characteristics. However, this practice may have unknown risks. This paper discusses the ecotoxicological potential associated with raw and construction materials, and proposes and applies a methodology for the assessment of their ecotoxicological potential. This methodology is based on existing laws, such as Regulation (European Commission) No. 1907/2006 (REACHRegistration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals) and Regulation (European Commission) No. 1272/2008 (CLPClassification, Labelling and Packaging). Its application and validation showed that raw material without clear evidence of ecotoxicological potential, but with some ability to release chemicals, can lead to the formulation of a CM with a slightly lower hazardousness in terms of chemical characterization despite a slightly higher ecotoxicological potential than the raw materials. The proposed methodology can be a useful tool for the development and manufacturing of products and the design choice of the most appropriate CM, aiming at the reduction of their environmental impact and contributing to construction sustainability.",2017

When designing a building facility, it is imperative to minimise the environmental burdens caused by buildings, particularly in terms of natural resource consumption as well as pollutants and waste generation due to the use of construction materials. Despite that, it is difficult for decision makers to ascertain the environmental impacts embedded in or emitted from new buildings, as there is no agreed upon approach to assess the environmental impacts of construction materials. In this paper, a midpoint life cycle impact assessment method is employed to assess the environmental impacts of construction materials. Four institutional buildings in Hong Kong that serve different social functions are examined. The type and the amount of materials used in those projects along with their environmental impacts are delineated. The results reveal that steel reinforcement, aluminium, copper, ceramic tile and concrete are the five most predominant materials in terms of environmental impacts in the selected institutional buildings in Hong Kong.

A geotechnical perspective of raw earth building,Compressed earth blocks; Earthen construction; Rammed earth; Raw earth; Soil compaction; Suction,RAMMED EARTH; STRENGTH; BLOCKS; DURABILITY; CLAY,"Much research has been devoted over the past 30 years to the development of construction materials that can lower the environmental and economic costs of buildings over their entire life by reducing embodied energy, minimizing air conditioning needs and cutting down demolition waste. In this respect, raw earth is an attractive material because it is natural and largely available. In its simplest form, this material consists of a compacted mixture of soil and water which is put in place with the least possible transformation. Raw earth construction has been practised in ancient times but has only recently been rediscovered thanks to modern technology, which has improved fabrication efficiency. If properly manufactured, raw earth exhibits comparable mechanical characteristics and better hygro-thermal properties than concrete or fired bricks. After a brief historical overview, we discuss the advantages of raw earth construction in terms of environmental impact, energy consumption and indoor air quality together with the main obstacles to its wider dissemination. We also review the hydro-thermo-mechanical behaviour of raw earth in the context of the recent geotechnical literature, by examining the dependency of key parameters such as strength, stiffness and moisture retention on: (a) material variables (e.g. particle size and mineralogy), (b) manufacturing variables (e.g. density and stabilization) and (c) environmental variables (e.g. pore suction, ambient humidity and temperature).",2017
Effectiveness of sewage sludge ash combined with waste pozzolanic minerals in developing sustainable construction material: An alternative approach for waste management,Sewage sludge ash; Mortar; Cementitious materials; Alkali activation; Waste management,CEMENTITIOUS MATERIAL; PORTLAND-CEMENT; FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; INCINERATION; EMISSIONS; MORTARS; SYSTEMS; LIME,"Utilization of the sewage sludge ash in fabricating the construction material would be an effective alternative approach under the sludge management scheme other than landfilling. The present investigation deals with the utilization of the recycled sewage sludge ash (SSA) combined with the quicklime (QL) and blast furnace slag (BFS) as a cementitious material in controlling the physical and mechanical performances of mortar. The mortar samples were prepared using the different amount of SSA, QL, BFS, and alkali activator (AA). The performance of the sewage sludge ash based mortar (SAM) was evaluated measuring the bulk density, apparent porosity, compressive strength, flexural strength, and shrinkage strain, etc. The result reveals that the higher dose of AA (50% weight w.r.t the volume of water used) and QL (20% w.r.t weight of the total cementitious material) influences the mechanical strength of SAM. Additionally, the optimum dose of the BFS (10% w.r.t. weight of the total cementitious material) leads to yield a maximum compressive strength (31.3 MPa) of SAM. Finally, based on the analytical analysis, a model has been proposed to explain the overall performance of the SAM. Hence, the utilization of SSA (70%) combined with QL (20%) and BFS (10%) for the fabrication of mortar and concrete is assumed to be an effective alternative technique in developing sustainable construction material and waste management as well.

Transforming Enhanced Landfill Mining Derived Gasification/Vitrification Glass into Low-Carbon Inorganic Polymer Binders and Building Products,Enhanced landfill mining; Plasma gasification; Solid recovered fuel; Vitrification; Inorganic polymer binders,CONTROL APC RESIDUES; PLASMA GASIFICATION/VITRIFICATION; WASTE TREATMENT; SLAGS,"The current paper reviews the concept of the production of high-added value construction materials produced as part of a zero waste enhanced landfill mining process. The calorific fraction of the excavated waste is concentrated to produce a solid recovered fuel, which is introduced to a gasification/vitrification process to be converted to a synthetic gas, a slag and a metal alloy. The slag is subsequently cooled to produce a glass. The glass is milled and blended with an alkaline silicate solution to produce an inorganic polymer binder. The binder can be used as an alternative for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in concrete to produce precast construction materials, such as pavers, tiles and wall elements. Pilot industrial production and testing of the durability, environmental footprint and economic feasibility of the process are currently being performed. Traditional OPC based production lines can be used, and when comparing with OPC based concrete, materials with similar to improved properties (e.g. higher hardening rate and higher final strength) can be produced.",2017
Mechanical performance of high strength concrete made from high volume of Metakaolin and hybrid fibers,Hybrid fiber; Metakaolin; Compressive strength; Split tensile strength; Bond strength,POLYPROPYLENE,"Among all construction materials, concrete made with Portland cement is one of the most used material all over the world. Reinforced concrete with short fibers distributed randomly was found to improve strength characteristics of cementitious matrices by controlling the initiation and/or spread of cracks. In this study, mechanical properties of high strength concrete with hybrid fibers were investigated. The properties included compressive strength, split tensile strength and bond strength of 21 mixtures containing hybrid fibers and Metakaolin. Combination of fibers, often called hybridization, refers to a composite of two or more types of fibers rationally combined in a matrix in order to produce a mixture that develops benefits from each fiber and shows a very good behavior. This study investigated the combination of different fiber proportions of steel and polypropylene in the presence of Metakaolin for a 60 MPa grade concrete at a total fiber volume fractions of 0.25% and 0.50%. It is concluded that the optimum percentage of cement replacement by MK is 15% either with the hybrid fiber fraction of 0.25% or 0.50%. The addition of different percentages of hybrid fibers to the concrete mixtures was effective for gaining strength at all testing ages. An increase in compressive strength of (13.62%, 24.17%, and 27.51%) for fiber content of 0.25% and (20.57%, 38.07%, 43.34%) for fiber content of 0.50% was observed at 28 days, respectively.

Behavior of RC beams strengthened with strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCC) subjected to monotonic and repeated loads,RC beams; Strengthening; UHP-SHCC; Ductility; Repeated load; Dissipated energy; Stiffness degradation,PERFORMANCE,"Ultra High Performance Strain Hardening Cementitious Composites (UHP-SHCC) is a newly developed construction material, has large advantages on large strain capacity as well as high compressive and tensile strength, which is useful for strengthening or repair concrete members. However, some important obstacles need to be studied, such as the strain localization occurs in the UHP-SHCC strengthening layer around the substrate concrete cracks, which severely limits the ductility of the strengthened beam subjected to monotonic and repeated loads. In the present study, ten specimens were tested experimentally, which divided into two major groups, each group contains five specimens, one as a control and four strengthened with constant UHP-SHCC layer thickness having variable reinforcement ratios embedded in the middle of the strengthening layer. Two types of loading were applied; Monotonic loading for the first group and short time repeated loading for the second group. The recorded tests showed that use additional reinforcement embedded in the strengthening layer for beams strengthened with UHP-SHCC become sufficient at certain limit to eliminate the observed early strain localization and to gain adequate ductility under both monotonic and repeated loading. Another important conclusion is the strengthening of RC structures using an unreinforced UHP-SHCC layer may lead to a brittle failure especially in case of repeated loading. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Composite Phase-Change Material Mold for Cost-Effective Production of Free-Form Concrete Panels,Free-form building; Concrete panel; Phase-changing material; Mold; Computerized numeric control; Construction materials and methods,,"Because free-form concrete panels are cast in different shapes depending on the part, the mold to produce these panels must vary by size and shape, making it difficult to reuse the mold. In addition, manufacturing a curve-shaped mold is difficult and requires a lot of labor. To solve this problem, a technology to manufacture molds made of phase-changing materials (PCMs) that can be semipermanently reused to produce various types of curved shapes was developed. However, because of the characteristics of the PCM mold materials, crystallization occurs within the mold, which increases cooling times and causes deformation in the mold due to shrinkage. This paper describe the development of a composite phase-changing material mold for quality production of free-form concrete panels, and this composite is used to solve the problems mentioned previously. The composite PCM mold developed herein does not induce crystallization, which reduces the cooling energy and cooling time by 50% or more, and improves the solidification shrinkage rate to 95% or better. The composite described in this paper will help increase the productivity of free-form concrete members and reduce production costs. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2017
Lifecycle Cost Analysis of Flat Roofs of Buildings,Energy performance; Flat roofs; Lifecycle cost analysis; Maintenance; Service life; Construction materials and methods,ENERGY SAVINGS; COOL ROOFS,"Flat roofs have had been gaining in popularity in several countries, and the roof is one of the building envelope elements where most thermal exchanges with the exterior occur, and this considerably influences the thermal performance of buildings. There is little international information on the joint thermal and economic performance, on the relevant methods of analysis, or on the comparison of various types of flat-roofing systems. A group of 472 flat roofs were studied, including roofs with limited access, accessible for people, and accessible for vehicles. All the costs associated with the lifecycle of flat roofs were estimated to find the most advantageous solutions in economic and energetic terms. It was found that material acquisition and execution costs are the most determinant; inverted flat roofs with limited accessibility are more economical; lightweight concrete with expanded polystyrene granules used as shaping layer and atactic polypropylene polymer bituminous or polyvinyl chloride thermoplastic membranes are the most economical solutions.

GIB is a hazardous pollutant that poses a threat to ecosystems, thus emphasizing the urgent need to find a sustainable and technologically viable way of utilizing GIB and thereby minimizing its risks. The paper aims to assess the feasibility of GIB as a possible sand replacement in the manufacturing of concrete. At a 0.50 water-to-cement ratio (w/c), feasibility studies were performed and analyses were done for 10, 25, 40, 55, and 70% sand replacement by GIB in the manufacturing of concrete. Strength and durability of concrete with different percentages of GIB particles were ascertained by comparing the results of compressive strength, flexural strength, abrasion, shrinkage, permeability, carbonation, acid attack, chloride penetration, and corrosion tests with the results from a control concrete. Test results were ably explained by using auxiliary analyses such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD).

Study of a hemperete wall exposed to outdoor climate: Effects of the coating,Hemp concrete; Hygrothermal behaviour; Outdoor climate exposure; Natural Prompt cement,HEMP CONCRETE; HYGROTHERMAL PERFORMANCE; LIME,"Hemp concrete is becoming a popular building construction material, as it has a low environmental impact and helps reducing the heat conductivity of walls. The generally used binder is lime, but in this study a prompt natural cement binder was used. The objective of this study was to analyse the behaviour of a hemperete wall in realistic conditions. 2 test walls made of prefabricated hemp concrete blocks were built. Those walls were exposed to the outdoor climate on the one side, and to a controlled indoor climate on the other side. 2 different exterior coatings were applied. The experiment lasted one year. In addition, numerical simulations were carried out. The model was used to determine the material properties and to help understand the behaviour measured. The results show that an important humidification of the wall can occur if the coating is not well chosen. The exterior coating must be very permeable to water vapour, but it seems to be important to prevent the absorption of rain as well, otherwise, the humidity inside the wall can lead to degradations such as mould growth or increased thermal conductivity. Both numerical simulation and measurements show that applying a vapour permeable coating on the blocks does not slow down the drying process, the hemperete itself being the limiting factor.

A detailed investigation of the mechanical properties of four different fly ash geopolymer concretes was carried out up to 1 year of age. Compressive, flexural, and splitting tensile strengths, elastic modulus, and Poisson's ratio of four geopolymer concretes at 1 year ranged between 28 and 88 MPa (4.06 and 12.76 ksi), 3.92 and 6.3 MPa (0.568 and 0.914 ksi), 1.86 and 4.72 MPa (0.27 and 0.684 ksi), 10.3 and 29 GPa (1493.5 and 4205 ksi), and 0.16 and 0.28, respectively. The results show an increase in performance observed between 90 and 365 days for all concretes depending on the fly ash properties. Tarong displayed the highest increase while Gladstone had the least, although Gladstone did display the best performance throughout. The nature of the gel matrix formed, in terms of uniformity and compactness, was observed to determine the mechanical properties. The nature of the interfacial transition zone formed between coarse aggregate and mortar and its density was observed to govern the tensile strength.

The column offers an ideal opportunity for the use of high-strength steel plates in construction, with their high yield stresses being fully utilized and without welding (and without welding residual stresses). The rationale for the column form and its expected advantages are explained and demonstrated through laboratory tests. Prefabricated glass fiber-reinforced polymer tubes of 1.5 and 3.0 mm thick and 203 mm diameter were infilled with concrete having a nominal strength of 32 MPa, with most specimens encasing steel plates of various configurations and yield stresses ranging from 290 to 455 MPa. Results from concentric and eccentric compression tests involving 13 specimens are presented to confirm the expected structural advantages. The results demonstrated that the concrete in the tested specimens was very effectively confined, and that buckling of all the steel plates was prevented by the encasing concrete up to and beyond the rupture of the fiber-reinforced polymer tubes, leading to full structural utilization of the construction materials and very ductile column responses under concentric and eccentric loadings. The needs for future research on high-strength steel plate-concrete-filled fiber-reinforced polymer tube columns are also discussed.",2017
Stiffness and deformation properties of spent coffee grounds based geopolymers,Coffee grounds; Geopolymer; Resilient moduli; Recycling,FLY-ASH; RESILIENT MODULUS; SUBGRADE SOILS; CEMENT; SLAG; CONCRETE; CLAY; STABILIZATION; PRECURSORS; BEHAVIOR,"Spent Coffee Grounds (CG) are the granular organic waste material from the food and beverage industry resulting from the brewing of coffee, and are often disposed to landfills. Fly Ash (FA) is the primary by-product of coal-combustion power-plants used for energy generation. Slag (5), on the other hand, is an industrial waste generated from iron-ore refineries. In this research, geopolymers comprised of various mix designs of CG, FA, and S were developed via alkaline activation to create a green construction material out of these traditional waste materials. The intended use for this recycled construction material was as a subgrade fill, which if successfully implemented would considerably reduce the need of disposing such waste materials into landfills. In this article, key design parameters including Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), resilient moduli (M-R) and permanent deformation characteristics of CG-geopolymer remoulded cylindrical specimens are evaluated using simulated long-term Repeated Load Triaxial (RLT) tests. Regression parameters used in two M-R prediction models, namely the Bulk Stress Model and 2-Parameter Model, were determined for the CG geopolymers. The developed 3-Parameter Model was found to be valid for predicting the M-R of CG geopolymers. When cured at 21 degrees C, the M-R for CG + FA geopolymers is generally lower than that of CG + S geopolymer specimens. Curing at 50 degrees C reduces this difference of MR values between FA and S geopolymers. At 50 degrees C curing, the M-R of some mixes, notably 70CG:30FA + 90Na(2)SiO(3):10NaOH, 70CG:30 S + 90Na(2)SiO(3):10NaOH, and 7OCG:30 S + 5ONa(2)SiO(3):5ONaOH decreases after 28 days of curing while gaining increased UCS. This indicates that these geopolymer can gain improved ductility while developing high strengths under optimum curing conditions. This article evaluates key design parameters including the M-R for CG geopolymer specimens, which enables coffee grounds to be used as green recycled construction materials in roads.

High performance concrete requirements for prefabricated high speed railway sleepers,High-speed railway; Concrete sleepers; High performance concrete; Carousel method; High early strength; Concrete segregation; Delayed ettringite formation,,"Modern high-speed railway tracks require the use of prefabricated high performance concrete sleepers. Compared to wood sleepers, high performance concrete sleepers with their higher density and weight, provide the required stability to railway tracks for high-speed travel. Higher durability of concrete compared to wood also provides an important basis for the preference of concrete as the construction material for railway track sleepers. This paper, through a case study of sleeper production for a high-speed railway project, presents the strength and performance requirements and addresses unique production aspects of prestressed concrete sleepers designed with high strength concrete produced by the carousel method. This paper also highlights the importance of concrete tensile strength in sleeper design and prevention of aggregate segregation during sleeper production and the important provisions for the attainment of early concrete strength within carefully monitored curing conditions to prevent delayed ettringite formation.

Dynamic Quality Control of Process Resource to Improve Concrete Supply Chain,Concrete technology; Feedforward information; Radio-frequency identification (RFID); Process resource; Supply chain; Embedded sensors; Concrete curing; Construction materials and methods,EARLY-AGE; CONSTRUCTION; TEMPERATURE; INSPECTION; MANAGEMENT,"The latest literature on quality management in the construction industry asserts that it has not been embraced as a holistic approach to improve overall performance. It is felt that management's insistence on punch-list inspection creates barriers to adopting the model that fosters a culture of constant improvement embraced by total quality management (TQM). With this recognition, this research paper presents a model that extends the output-oriented process model to pursue continuous improvement along the supply chain. Extensive field observations and discussions with contractors show that the ready-mixed concrete supply and placement suffers the loss of information when concrete is delivered in truckloads and sampled for quality testing in the laboratory. Without recording the spatial boundaries of a truck volume of poured concrete, a failing quality report leads to large costs for core-drilling to find the location of the unacceptable concrete poured 28days earlier. The latter part of the paper will present the work to design and field-experiment a feedforward control method that also served as a novel electronic as-built documenter. Ruggedized radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags were added (embedded) as the concrete flowed from the truck into the hopper of the pump. A hand-held RFID reader not only detected 14 out of the 15 embedded tags, but the tags' readability served as an indicator of the concrete's curing progress. The unique contribution of this research project can be seen in the experimental work established by the feasible evidence measured from a real-world construction context. In order to overcome the ingrained view of reactive inspection in concrete supply chains, this research offers a proposed approach whereby its workability is evaluated through first-hand examination.

"Development, Testing, and Implementation Strategy of a Translucent Concrete-Based Smart Lane Separator for Increased Traffic Safety",Translucent concrete; Structural testing; Road management; Traffic safety; Accident mitigation; Plastic optical fiber; Implementation strategy; Construction materials and methods,POST-INSTALLED ANCHOR; GLASS-POWDER; MODEL,"The design of roads has seen incremental changes in the past few decades while cars have advanced leaps and bounds in safety technology. Most of these technologies reply on road markings along with cameras, radars, and high-tech software to achieve the desired results. However, one piece of the traffic safety puzzle has so far gone undetected and has virtually remained unchanged since its advent, the lane markers; with the advancements in car technology, we also need high-tech road systems that can couple with the car's safety systems to reduce road accidents. In this regard, the presented research details the development, testing, and real-world application strategy for a new translucent concrete-based lane separator. The developed device is capable of transmitting colored light by embedding the plastic optical fibers in the self-compacting concrete. The proposed device can be embedded in the road surface for road illumination and for conveying real-time useful information to the drivers, such as traffic density, to optimize lane saturation, sudden stoppage in traffic ahead of the vehicle, road blockage, and changes in road geometry. The optimum volume of plastic optical fiber tendon is selected as 3% by experimentation. This resulted in 11% loss of compressive strength, which is much less than reported in literature. This reduction in loss of strength can be attributed to the innovative idea of using rough surface to improve the bonding of the plastic optical fiber tendon and the surrounding concrete. Strength test, temperature test, and skid resistance testing was conducted to evaluate the structural performance of the developed prototype. From the presented results and analysis, it can be concluded that the proposed device can be used for both flexible and rigid pavements. Furthermore, the newly developed material can be used for architectural and aesthetical purposes. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2017
Construction Techniques Used to Automatically Pass Standard Box Girders through Special Passenger-Line Tunnels,Girder-transporting vehicle; Distance; Tunnel; Construction; Automation; Construction materials and methods,VEHICLE; DESIGN; SYSTEM,"When a box girder passes through a rail tunnel erected for special passenger lines, the box girder frequently exceeds the inner profile of the lining, making it difficult to travel through a tunnel without collisions. After comparing several methods for accommodating vehicles used to transport box girders when they pass through rail tunnels, reducing the height of filled concrete in the inverted arch was determined to be the most suitable option. In addition, analysis of associated problems such as the need to maintain the height of the filled concrete in the inverted arch, running speed of girder-transporting vehicles, space geometry in tunnels, and safety of girder-transporting vehicles carrying box girders while passing through tunnels was carried out. An automatic control system was designed according to the construction process in this study. Inspection tests were carried out by use of a trestle-built model and after actual box girders, meanwhile the safety and viability were determined. The system detected distances using signals from ultrasonic and laser ranging devices. The system can be switched to the automatic drive mode. The control system automatically adjusts the direction and speed. These steps allow the 129 components found on standard box girders to pass through the tunnel safely and successfully.

Comparative LCA on using waste materials in the cement industry: A Hong Kong case study,Bio-fuel; Cement production; Energy consumption; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Waste glass,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; PORTLAND-CEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; MANUFACTURING PROCESS; ALTERNATIVE FUEL; CO2 EMISSIONS; CONCRETE; ENERGY; EFFICIENCY; INVENTORY,"Cement is traditionally regarded as an energy and emission intensive construction material. The reduction of environmental impacts in the cement industry has gained increasing concern worldwide for environmental sustainability. As a resource-scarce city, cement production in Hong Kong is associated with high CO2 emissions, thus contributing significantly to the high environmental impacts in the construction industry. This study herein has been conducted to comprehensively assess the energy consumption and global warming potential impacts of different types of cement manufactured in Hong Kong using life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques. Two sustainable strategies for the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gases emission in the cement industry were then proposed. The LCA results showed that ordinary Portland cement production has high environmental impacts mainly clue to the import of associated raw materials and burning of fossil fuel. The use of alternative material, such as fly ash would help to reduce the environmental impacts. Significant impacts reductions associated with cement production can be further achieved by strategies such as the use of glass powder from locally generated waste glass bottles as part of the raw materials, and the use of a bio-fuel produced from locally generated wood wastes as a co-fuel with coal. The assessment results indicated that about 12% of the total greenhouse gases emission and 15% of energy consumption can be reduced from the cement industry in Hong Kong by using waste materials to replace virgin materials (clinker/coal).

A sustainable application of recycled tyre crumbs as insulator in lightweight cellular concrete,Recycled tyre crumbs; Lightweight cellular concrete; Sound insulation; Thermal insulation; Permeability; Porosity,TIRE-RUBBER PARTICLES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; AGGREGATE; PERFORMANCE; REPLACEMENT; DURABILITY,"End-of-life waste tyres are known to have negative economic and environmental impacts due to the difficulty associated with their disposal and recycling. The use of recycled tyre crumb (RTC) as a component of construction materials has emerged as a potentially sustainable solution to this environmental issue. There exists extensive research covering the use of RTC as a filler in conventional concrete. However, there are very limited studies focused on insulation properties of RTC in lightweight cellular concrete (LCC) as a sustainable application that can add value to the final product. This study investigates the effects of different RTC contents on compressive strength, porosity, thermal conductivity, sound insulation and water permeability of LCC as an insulator. A rather homogeneous distribution of tyre crumbs within LCC structure was achieved. It has been found that LCC samples containing RTC are suitable as insulators because the sound and thermal insulation are improved as rubber content is increased compared to the sample with similar density but without RTC. The insulation properties of this product also come with the same total porosity and a significant reduction in the rate of water permeability compared to the sample without RTC. 3D restructuring of micro-CT scan images of this composite revealed the effects of tyre crumb on the total and local porosity of this composite. Despite the fact that addition of tyre crumb reduced the strength, surface treatment of crumb rubber with sodium hydroxide solution exhibited significant improvement in the compressive strength of LCC as the result of better physical bonding with hydrated cement proven by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis.

Why Excavation of a Small Air Shaft Caused Excessively Large Displacements: Forensic Investigation,Air shaft; Diaphragm walling; Excavation; Wall displacement; Ground settlement; Soft clay; Design; Construction,CENTRAL-ISLAND TECHNIQUE; DEEP FOUNDATION PIT; SOFT CLAY; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; PREDICTION; CULVERTS; ADJACENT; WALLS,"Any deficiency in excavation design or construction could lead to excessively large retaining wall and ground displacements, usually accompanied by damage to adjacent structures or facilities. This paper documents a case history of a small air shaft excavation in Shanghai soft clay. Its maximum lateral wall displacement and ground settlement were twice and three times the local deformation control criteria and 3 and 14times those of one adjacent air shaft excavation featuring similar subsurface conditions, geometric size, and supporting system. To identify probable causes pertaining to its poor performance, a comprehensive investigation was carried out in both design (propping element, supporting system stiffness, wall penetration ratio, and jet grouting of basal soils) and construction (excavation duration, excavation width, exposed wall length, and management of heavy-duty truck and stockpile of construction materials). The investigations show that there were several major contributory factors, among them were adoption of cast concrete struts at deep excavation level, removal of underlying jet-grouted soil layer before fully curing of concrete strut, and passing over of trucks and stockpiling of construction materials nearby. On the basis of the analysis of its field instrumentation data and comparison with the adjacent air shaft excavation and another four subway station excavations, adverse effects of the identified contributory factors were quantified, valuable lessons were learned, and graphical solutions for estimating effects of excavation width and exposed wall length on lateral wall displacement and predicting diaphragm walling-induced ground settlement were derived.

Strength and behaviour of recycled aggregate geopolymer concrete beams,recycled aggregate; geopolymer concrete; mechanical properties; flexural behaviour,DURABILITY,"In the present day scenario, concrete construction is rapidly becoming uneconomical and non sustainable practice, due to the scarcity of raw materials and environmental pollution caused by the manufacturing of cement. In this study an attempt has been made to propose recycled aggregates from demolition wastes as coarse aggregate in geopolymer concrete (GPC). Experimental investigations have been conducted to find optimum percentage of recycled aggregates (RA) in GPC by replacing 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of coarse aggregates by RA to produce recycled aggregate geopolymer concrete (RGPC). From the study it has been found that the optimum replacement percentage of recycled aggregates was 40% based on mechanical properties and workability. In order to study and compare the flexural behaviour of RGPC and GPC four beams of size 175 mmx150 mmx1200 mm were prepared and tested under two point loading. Test results were evaluated with respect to first crack load, ultimate load, loaddeflection characteristics, ductility and energy absorption characteristics. Form the experimental study it can be concluded that the addition of recycled aggregate in GPC causes slight reduction in its strength and ductility. Since the percentage reduction in strength and behaviour of RGPC is meager compared to GPC it can be recommended as a sustainable and environment friendly construction material.",2017
Mechanical behaviour of hypercompacted earth for building construction,Raw earth; Hypercompaction; Compacted earth bricks; Young modulus; Compressive strength; Rammed earth; Earth construction; Bio-sourced construction materials,STABILIZED RAMMED EARTH; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; SOIL; IMPACT,"This paper investigates the mechanical behaviour of a hypercompacted unstabilized earth material manufactured by compressing a moist soil to very high pressures up to 100 MPa. The hypercompaction procedure increases material density, which in turn improves mechanical characteristics. Samples were manufactured at the scale of both small cylinders and masonry bricks. The effect of ambient humidity on the mechanical characteristics of the material was investigated at the scale of cylindrical samples, showing that both strength and stiffness are sensitive to environmental conditions and tend to increase as ambient humidity reduces. The strength of the bricks was instead investigated under laboratory ambient conditions by using different experimental configurations to assess the influence of sample slenderness and friction confinement. Additional tests were also performed to evaluate the influence of mortar joints and compaction-induced anisotropy. Overall, the hypercompacted earth material exhibits mechanical characteristics that are comparable with those of traditional building materials, such as fired bricks, concrete blocks or stabilized compressed earth.",2017
Photocatalitically Active Concrete: How Innovative Construction Materials Can Contribute to the Degradation of Dangerous Air Pollutants,,,"The handling of environmental pollution caused by air pollutants like NOX, SO3 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is still a major challenge, especially in urban areas. One possibility to degrade these substances is by their oxidation on the surface of an illuminated photocatalyst, like the well known white pigment titanium dioxide (TiO2). Under illumination, oxidizing species are formed on the TiO2 surface, which are then able to decompose organic and inorganic species. By direct adding of or supplementary coating with the photocatalyst innovative building materials like concrete, plaster, floor plates and roof tiles are accessible, which not only fulfill their main task but also improve the air quality of the environment.",2017
Comparison of inundation depth and momentum flux based fragilities for probabilistic tsunami damage assessment and uncertainty analysis,Tsunami; Cascadia Subduction Zone; Fragility curves; Building damage; Momentum flux; Disaster resilience,EAST JAPAN TSUNAMI; BUILDING DAMAGE; CURVES; OREGON; SEASIDE; HAZARDS; MODEL; SCALE; VULNERABILITY; METHODOLOGY,"Annual exceedance probabilities of the maximum tsunami inundation depth, h(Max), and momentum flux, M-Max, conditional on a full-rupture event of the Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) were used to estimate the probability of building damage using a fragility analysis at Seaside, Oregon. Tax lot data, Google Street View, and field reconnaissance surveys were used to classify the buildings in Seaside and to correlate building typologies with existing fragility curves according to the construction material, number of stories, and building seismic design level based on the date of construction. A fragility analysis was used to estimate the damage probability of buildings for 500-, 1000-, and 2500-year exceedance probabilities conditioned on a full-rupture CSZ event. Finally, the sensitivity of building damage was estimated for both the aleatory and epistemic uncertainties involved in the process of damage estimation. Probable damage estimates from the fragility curves based on h(Max) and on M-Max both generally. show higher damage probability for structures that are wooden and closer to the shoreline than those that are reinforced concrete (RC) and further landward of the shoreline. However, a relatively high and somewhat unrealistic damage probability was found at the river and creek region from the fragility curve analysis using h(Max). Within 500 m from the shoreline, wood structure damage shows significant sensitivity to the aleatory uncertainty of the tsunami generation from the CSZ event. On the other hand, RC structure damage showed equal sensitivity to the aleatory uncertainty of the tsunami generation as well as the epistemic uncertainties due to the numerical modeling of the tsunami inundation (friction), the building classification (material and date of construction), and the type of fragility curves (depth or momentum flux type curves). Further from the shoreline, the wood structures showed similar aleatory and epistemic uncertainties, qualitatively similar to the RC structure sensitivity closer to the shoreline.",2017
Development of lightweight ceramic construction materials based on fly ash,Porosity; Lightweight ceramic brick; Insulation; Fly ash,,"This study aims to demonstrate the suitability of using lightweight ceramics as a construction material in preference to autoclaved aerated concrete and pumice blocks or the more commonly used brick. For construction applications, ceramics show good stability under fatigue loadings and severe environmental conditions and are an economical alternative to other materials. Although bricks have better mechanical properties than the new generation construction materials, thermal insulation properties of brick are much lower. Hence, the use of bricks as a fired construction materials is becoming increasingly unfavorable; as a result, brick manufacturers are losing their market share day-by-day. This study aims to develop an alternative fired lightweight, ceramic construction material with fly ash with relatively better mechanical and thermal insulation properties.",2017
Structural performance of ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete beams,curing; deflection; flexural behavior; moment capacity; steel fibers; toughness; ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete,REACTIVE POWDER CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,"Ultra-high-performance fiber-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) is a relatively new construction material. In comparison with conventional high-strength concrete, UHPFRC does not usually contain coarse aggregates larger than 6-7 mm in size. This paper presents the outcomes of an experimental study of UHPFRC beams subjected to four-point loading. The effect of two parameters was studied, namely, the fiber content and the temperature of the curing water. Eight UHPFRC beams were tested, comprising six beams reinforced with rebars and two beams without rebars. Three fiber contents were investigated in this study (1, 2, and 4% in volume). The study investigated two curing temperatures of water, 20 and 90 degrees C. The results presented in this paper include deflections, toughness energy, and moment capacity and also includes a comparison with calculations according to EC2 provisions. A minor difference was observed in the deformation and flexural behavior of beams with fiber contents of 1 and 2% (in volume). However, beams with 4% (in volume) fibers exhibited a higher flexural capacity. Only flexural failure was observed and no shear-related failure was recorded. Beams with 1% (in volume) fibers for both curing regimes had the highest peak load toughness energy. Beams reinforced with rebars and cured at 20 degrees C had a significantly higher bending resistance.",2017

For the prompt reuse and insufficient reclamation site, quality control of FA which is main productive construction material from coal ash is very important. Assessed Pozzolanic-activity Index (API) test which needs only 2 days for evaluation of pozzolanic reaction is currently considered as an alternative of activity index measurement. This paper aims for an applicability of API test for prompt quality control and investigation of domestic FA properties. For the work, FAs from two different power plant types are prepared, and quality tests are carried out based on Korean Standards (KS) methods and API method. Lots of test results are compared with those from API and K-value test for FA with age of 7 days-1 year. From the test results for FA aged 1 year, API results are evaluated to be closely related with those from activity index and K-value, and the correlations are improved with increasing ages regardless of plant types. The applicability of API test is verified and the reduced period of FA quality evaluation can accelerate prompt use and the related process of FA.",2017

The shell material was a gelatin-acacia gum crosslinked coacervate and the produced microcapsules had diameters ranging from 300 to 700 mu m. The shell material designed with switchable mechanical properties. When it is hydrated exhibits soft and 'rubbery' behaviour and, when dried, transitions to a stiff and 'glassy' material. The microcapsules survived drying and rehydrating cycles and preserved their structural integrity when exposed to highly alkaline solutions that mimic the pH environment of concrete. Microscopy revealed that the shell thickness of the microcapsules varies across their perimeter from 5 to 20 mu m. Thermal analysis showed that the produced microcapsules were very stable up to 190 degrees C. Proof of concept investigation has demonstrated that the microcapsules successfully survive and function when exposed to a cement-based matrix. Observations showed that the microcapsules survive mixing with cement and rupture successfully upon crack formation releasing the encapsulated sodium silicate solution.",2017
Effect of lime stabilization on the mechanical and micro-scale properties of recycled demolition materials,Lime; Demolition materials; Stabilization; Resilient modulus; Recycling,CONSTRUCTION; WASTE,"Sustainable reuse options for Construction and Demolition (C&D) materials in civil engineering applications have been an emerging topic in recent years. Crushed Brick (CB), Recycled Crushed Concrete (RCA) and Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) comprise a major fraction of the wastes going to landfills. This research investigates the performance of lime stabilized C&D materials as road materials. Tests were undertaken on unbound and lime stabilized C&D materials with 1% to 5% hydrated lime. The laboratory investigation included particle size distribution, California Bearing Ratio, modified Proctor compaction, Repeated Load Triaxial (RLT) test and Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests. The effect of temperature curing, up to 40 degrees C was investigated and compared to ambient temperature. The resilient modulus results indicated that the lime stabilized RCA and CB were viable options for construction of subbase layers of pavement while RAP did not meet the requirements of a road construction material. UCS values of RCA and CB met the minimum requirement for cementitious materials after 7 days of curing. In addition to evaluating the mechanical properties, micro-scale analyses were also conducted using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) to understand the behavior of the lime stabilization of C&D materials.

Preparation of lunar regolith based geopolymer cement under heat and vacuum,Lunar regolith; Lunar construction; Geopolymer; Lunar habitation,CONCRETE,"Ever since the beginning of the space program, lunar habitation has always been on peoples' minds. Prior researchers have explored habitat building materials some based on earth-based construction materials, some based on in-situ lunar resources. Geopolymer cement is a cementitious binder made of aluminosilicate materials such as lunar regolith. A cementitious binder made of lunar regolith as the main geopolymer precursor, instead of as an added aggregate, is a solution that has not been deeply explored in prior works. This research explores the curing process of lunar regolith based geopolymer cement in an environment that loosely approximates the lunar environment, using the lunar average daytime temperature and a vacuum. The results did not show much promise for the samples cured under both heat and vacuum as the longest-cured data point did not meet compressive strength standards, but another pathway to lunar habitation may be found in a separate set of samples that cured under heat and ambient atmospheric pressure.

Reducing greenhouse gas emission and forest resource consumption is imperative. Producing, manufacturing, and using construction materials such as concrete, steel, and formworks consume abundant energy and produce considerable waste, affecting the natural environment. Specifically, formwork engineering, which involves substantial forest resource harvesting and waste production in manufacturing and using timber formworks, requires attention. Ctirrently, formwork engineering in Taiwan has typically adopted timber formworks. In 2013-2015, the annual average total floor area of reinforced concrete buildings was 30,950,383 m(2) in Taiwan. Converting this number to the number of timber formworks revealed that a staggering 1,843,437 cedar trees aged 30 years were required annually for the aforementioned total area, excluding other types of engineering such as bridges and retaining walls. This study sought to reduce the use of timber formworks to decrease deforestation, preventing forest resource depletion. Specifically, plastic formworks exhibit considerably improved reusability, low manufacturing costs, and favorable recyclability. The recyclability of plastic formworks enables the reuse of the material and purpose of environmental sustainability. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2017
A MESOSCALE INVESTIGATION ON THE SIZE EFFECT OF THE FRACTURE CHARACTERISTICS IN CONCRETE,Meso-scale; Size effect; Concrete; Cracking process,,"The size effect or scaling phenomenon is a fundamental problem when dealing with fracture of geomaterials. Concrete is considered as one of world's most widely used construction materials. The design in civil engineering of structural concrete should take into account the size effect when extrapolating the experimental tests at laboratory scale to structures with large dimensions. The size effect is generally investigated on the nominal strength which is an important parameter for design in civil engineering. However, the fracture characteristics are also considered in structural concrete codes. The limitation of cracking (crack width, crack length, etc.) are important aspects to consider in order to guarantee a safe conception. This paper deals with a numerical analysis of size effect on the nominal strength and on the cracking characteristics in concrete beams. Numerical simulations of geometrically similar notched beams of various sizes are performed using a mesoscopic approach with an isotropic damage model. In order to properly describe the cracking process, a post processing method based on the fracture energy regularization is adopted. The size effect on crack-opening and crack length evolution is investigated by comparing the numerical results with experimental data obtained by digital image correlation technique. The numerical results prove the ability of the mesoscopic approach to describe the size effect on the global behavior and the local behavior of concrete. The numerical investigation reveals the existing of a size effect on the cracking process evolution.",2017
Experimental Optimization of High-Strength Self-Compacting Concrete Based on D-Optimal Design,Self-compacting concrete; Design of experiment; D-optimal design; Response surface; D-optimality; Construction materials and methods,FLY-ASH; CEMENT,"Because of the high variability in the material content of high-strength self-compacting concrete (HSSCC), a huge number of trial sets (experiments) are often essential to find the optimum mixture proportions needed to achieve desired HSSCC properties. In the current investigation, an effort was made to considerably reduce the number of such experiments and to study the influence of different mixture parameters on the properties of HSSCC using a response surface method coupled with D-optimal design of experiment (DOE). In this study, water-binder ratio, cement content, fine-aggregate percentage, fly ash content and superplasticizer content were chosen as input variables, with compressive strength, passing ability, segregation, and manufacturing cost as responses. For each response, a full quadratic model and second-order polynomial equation was developed using central composite design (CCD) and D-optimal design. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out to check adequacy. Responses were analyzed in blocks where two mixture parameter vary and others stay constant. To determine the efficiency of the approach, the D-optimality of the CCD and D-optimal design were studied and compared. It was found that the D-optimal design reduces the number of trials 40.38-50% compared with standard design with less significant change on responses (0.32-0.54% change for compressive strength, 0.93-0.415% change for passing ability, 0.99-1.35% change for segregation and 3.9-4.35% change for cost), and provides dependable predictions as demonstrated in this investigation.",2017
Stiffness Properties of Recycled Concrete Aggregate with Polyethylene Plastic Granules in Unbound Pavement Applications,Stiffness; Resilient modulus; Recycled materials; Polyethylene plastic; Pavement subbase; Pavement base,DEMOLITION MATERIALS; CONSTRUCTION; SUBBASE; BRICK,"The growing population in the modern world has resulted in an increase in waste generation and stockpiles. There have been increasing concerns on how to sustainably reuse wastes in civil and geotechnical engineering applications. Two major municipal waste streams are plastic wastes and recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) generated by demolition activities. A potential application for growing stockpiles of plastic and RCA waste is in the construction of roads because pavement base and subbases typically demand significant quantities of construction materials. In this research, RCA was blended with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastics. A range of geotechnical tests such as California bearing ratio (CBR), unconfined compressive strength (UCS), and repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests were conducted on RCA-HDPE and RCA-LDPE blends. Comparison of CBR, UCS, and RLT results with those of typical quarry materials indicated that RCA-HDPE and RCA-LDPE can be used sustainably in the construction of pavement base and subbase layers.

Thermal characteristics of these samples were experimentally determined in terms of conductivity, diffusivity, capacity and effusivity. Furthermore, flexural and compressive strength of the samples were systematically evaluated. The results show that the DPF mesh has a positive effect on the thermomechanical properties of the composite material. Indeed, it significantly enhances the insulating capacity of the mortar, increases heat diffusion damping rate and makes mortar lighter. The DPF mesh also ameliorates the mortar ductility while respecting the mechanical requirements for construction materials. The mortar-DPF mesh composite could be classified among the structural and insulating materials according to the functional classification of RILEM. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
"Properties of alkali-activated controlled low-strength material produced with waste water treatment sludge, fly ash, and slag",Controlled low-strength material (CLSM); Water treatment sludge (WTS); Fly ash; Ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS); Alkali-activated CLSM,INDUSTRIAL BY-PRODUCTS; SOLIDS-TO-LIQUID; RICE HUSK ASH; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; MATERIALS CLSM; ECO-CEMENT; GEOPOLYMERS; CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE; MORTARS,"Controlled low-strength material (CLSM) is a self-compacting, flowable, and low-strength construction material that is used widely in variety construction applications. The present study evaluates the properties of CLSM that was prepared using a mixture of class-F fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) with the addition of three different ratios (0%, 10%, and 20% as calculated by combined FA and GGBFS weight) of waste water treatment sludge (WTS). A sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution was used to activate these powder materials in the mixture in order to produce the alkali-activated CLSM. The effects of adding WTS on the properties of both fresh and hardened CLSM are evaluated using workability, setting time, drop ball time, unit weight, compressive strength, and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) tests. Moreover, a scanning electron microscope (SEM) coupled with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to examine the microstructural properties of the CLSM. Results show that adding WTS to the CLSM samples reduces workability and increases fresh unit weight and compressive strength. Additionally, initial setting time and drop ball time are both associated positively with level of WTS content. Moreover, the liquid-to-solid (L/S) ratio and the alkali equivalent (AE) are shown to affect the properties of the CLSM significantly. The TCLP assessed leaching concentrations of heavy metals are all significantly below the regulatory thresholds that are currently allowed by the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in Taiwan. Finally, the properties of the CLSM sample with an LAS ratio of 0.9, WTS of 10%, and AE of 9% are found to conform well to the requirements of the Public Works Department, Taipei Government in terms of design principles and provisions.

THE USE OF RECYCLED MATERIALS FOR PAVEMENTS IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA,,,"There have been a number of innovations and developments in Western Australia in recent years on the use of recycled materials in road pavement construction. Materials used or being researched include demolition materials (concrete, bricks and tiles), asphalt millings, existing granular pavement material, scrap rubber, glass, plastic and vitrified clay pipe. There are sound environmental reasons for making use of recycled materials. In terms of cost, savings in landfill fees are a significant factor. In some cases, the addition of recycled material to standard road pavement materials such as bitumen and asphaltic concrete results in an improvement in properties. A key objective of this paper is to facilitate the wider adoption of the use of recycled materials in road pavement construction. This document was produced by a working group from the Western Australian Pavements Group (a subcommittee of Australian Geomechanics Society comprising Consultants, Main Roads WA, Local Government, Material Suppliers, Contractors and Researchers).",2017
Applications of Nanocomposites in Architecture and Construction.,Nanocomposites; Nanodesign; Nanotechnology,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; NANO-PARTICLES; CEMENT; COMPOSITE; COATINGS; CONCRETE; FILMS,"This paper is a review article that has as objective to offer an overview of the use and application of nanocomposites in architecture and construction industries on the basis of a review of scientific literature from the architect's standpoint. The applications divide and classify mainly according to the use of nanomaterials to improve their properties and functioning from a number of categories of construction materials such as: improvement of strengths of Portland-based concrete adding nanomaterials: improvement of reinforcing steel's corrosion and deterioration resistance adding nanomaterials; use of nanocomposites to repel dampness and dust, fingerprints and bacteria in construction components; thermal insulation and UV protection; in newgeneration photovoltaic cells and panels; high-quality, long-lasting waterproofing materials and sealants; in electronic parts and components of telecommunication and illumination; in the production of water filters, purifiers and treatment equipment. It is concluded that improvement to such materials by means of nanocomposites will depend on a number of situations such as: design, amounts, characterization and assessment of construction materials in relation to components and construction systems; weather and degradation conditions that affect materials; conditions of use and maintenance that affect the materials, procedures and quality in the production and construction of the components and materials.",2017
Acceleration of Intended Pozzolanic Reaction under Initial Thermal Treatment for Developing Cementless Fly Ash Based Mortar,cementless mortar; pozzolanic reaction; thermal treatment; fly ash; silica fume,BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; GEOPOLYMER CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; CURING TEMPERATURE; DRYING SHRINKAGE; SILICA FUME; AUTOGENOUS SHRINKAGE; AMBIENT-TEMPERATURE; HIGH-VOLUME,"Without using strong alkaline solution or ordinary Portland cement, a new structural binder consisting of fly ash and hydrated lime was hardened through an intensified pozzolanic reaction. The main experimental variables are the addition of silica fume and initial thermal treatment (60 degrees C for 3 days). A series of experiments consisting of mechanical testing (compressive and flexural strength, modulus of elasticity), X-ray diffraction, and measurements of the heat of hydration, pore structure, and shrinkage were conducted. These tests show that this new fly ash-based mortar has a compressive strength of 15 MPa at 91 days without any silica fume addition or initial thermal treatment. The strength increased to over 50 MPa based on the acceleration of the intensified pozzolanic reaction from the silica fume addition and initial thermal treatment. This is explained by a significant synergistic effect induced by the silica fume. It intensifies the pozzolanic reaction under thermal treatment and provides a space filling effect. This improved material performance can open a new pathway to utilize the industrial by-product of fly ash in cementless construction materials.",2017
Current Trends of Durability Design and Government Support in South Korea: Chloride Attack,durability design; design code; deterministic approach; probabilistic approach,SERVICE LIFE PREDICTION; REINFORCEMENT CORROSION; PROBABILISTIC APPROACH; RELIABILITY-ANALYSIS; RC STRUCTURES; CONCRETE; DIFFUSION; MODEL,"Concrete is considered to be a construction material with high durability and excellent fire resistance. However, degradation occurs, leading to structural safety problems and expensive maintenance costs. Currently, durability design and its concepts are provided in the concrete specifications and structural design codes in many countries, but they vary in terms of the design methodologies and users' demands. Reinforced concrete (RC) structures based on a reasonable durability design with a quantitative procedure can prevent unnecessary maintenance expenses and reduce environmental loads. This paper presents the current trends of durability design in South Korea and government support for infrastructure. In this work, the two representative durability design philosophies (deterministic and probabilistic approaches) are briefly summarized, and the current guidelines and related requirements for durability design in several countries are investigated. Durability design is now changing from simple material requirement control to performance-based design with quantitative parameters considering various exposure classifications and evaluation processes. RC structures based on reasonable durability design can make a great contribution to reducing maintenance costs and environmental effects like CO2 emissions.",2017
UTILIZATION OF AGGREGATE QUARRY WASTE IN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY,Aggregate Quarry Waste; Compressive Strength; Flexural Strength; Unit Weight,BEHAVIOR,"The use of solid wastes as a new ingredient in construction materials is one possible innovative effort to reduce environmental degradation and to facilitate sustainable use of natural resources. The disposal of the huge amount of wastes from aggregate quarry (WAQ) is one adverse environmental effects of quarrying activities. Finding useful application of this solid waste, specifically as a substitute for fine aggregates in concrete mix, alleviates disposal problems and helps the construction industry to come up with concrete products at lesser cost. This study investigates the structural performance of concrete with WAQ as substitute for fine aggregates in a concrete mix following ASTM standards. Concrete with WAQ as fine aggregates achieved almost 78% of its target compressive strength. The reduced compressive strength is due to the finer and less-angular particles of WAQ in comparison to sand. Empirical model was formulated that can be used to predict the compressive strength of concrete with WAQ as substitute for sand. Using the formulated model, the optimum compressive strength can be achieved at 85% substitution for sand. The flexural strength of concrete with WAQ was in the range of 69% to 72% of the flexural strength of concrete without WAQ. The presence of WAQ in the concrete mixture has no significant effect in its unit weight, however, it affects the workability of the mix due to its cohesive property thus requires higher water-cement ratio. Test results proved that concrete with WAQ as substitute for fine aggregates has strength properties adequate for structural application.",2017
Current State of Reflective Cracking in the United States,Reflective cracking; Composite pavements; Combined survey data analysis; Construction materials and methods,,"Reflective cracking is the most common type of distress for composite pavements that employ a hot-mix asphalt surface course over a portland cement concrete slab. Reflective cracking left untreated is known to contribute to a rougher and noisier ride and to hasten the premature failure of the surface material at or near joints. Nevertheless, the current practices of many states in the United States to manage reflective cracking are not effective due to the lack of having systematic procedures in place for not only evaluating the actual reflective cracking condition but to select the appropriate treatment methods through the decision-making process as well. To overcome the current practical issues, the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) conducted a research study to develop a decision-making process to enhance treatment selection for reflective cracking in composite pavements. A survey of all state DOTs was conducted within the INDOT study to determine the current state of the practice in managing reflective cracking. This paper synthesizes all the levels of knowledge gathered in four selected topic areas by analyzing the data collected through the survey: (1) reflective cracking treatment methods, (2) testing methods, (3) factors and constraints to select correct treatment methods, and (4) decision-making methods. The analyzed results of the survey were combined with the results of two previous surveys in order to validate the reliability of the survey results presented in this paper as well as obtain more comprehensive knowledge about reflective cracking management practices nationwide. For the combined data analysis, the separate approach was used. In conclusion, this paper contributes the following to the body of knowledge: (1) provides detailed information about the topics surveyed; (2) identifies consistent perceptions in terms of the prevalent treatment methods, treatment method preferences, widely used testing methods, and systematic decision-making procedures; and (3) estimates more precise statistics at the national level.

Development of national and local exposure models of residential structures in Chile,Exposure model; Seismic vulnerability; Residential building stock; Seismic risk; Digital surveys; Remote sensing,SEISMIC VULNERABILITY; EARTHQUAKE; BUILDINGS; SATELLITE,"Large-scale impacts from natural disasters suffered by society encourage researchers and public agencies to develop methods to evaluate, mitigate, respond, and recover from these events. A key aspect for the calculation of the potential earthquake losses is to properly describe the characteristics and value of assets exposed to seismic hazard. This article describes a methodology to develop an exposure model at a census-block resolution for residential structures in Chile using statistical data. The methodology is based on three steps: (1) obtaining dwelling count, construction material and location from census data, (2) defining classification rules for dwellings associated with houses and apartment buildings, and (3) assigning structural typologies and replacement cost. The resulting exposure model consists of a database with the number of residential structures classified into 18 structural typologies at each census block and the associated replacement cost. A total of 4,259,804 residential structures were identified in the national exposure model. Overall, clay brick and concrete block masonry account for 53.5 % of the structures of the country followed by timber (33.7 %), reinforced concrete (8.1 %), and adobe (4.6 %). Also, a methodology using remote digital survey techniques is proposed and used to obtain local exposure models for the cities of Iquique, Rancagua, and Osorno. The results of the national exposure model are compared with the local exposure models. An important feature of the proposed methodologies is that the building stock is classified into structural typologies, which is a key aspect for conducting seismic risk assessment. The methodologies used to construct the national and local exposure models may be extrapolated to other countries by adjusting the classification rules. The exposure models that were constructed represent an important input for risk calculations, by improving the technical capabilities for seismic risk management of the country.",2017
Design technology based on resizing method for reduction of costs and carbon dioxide emissions of high-rise buildings,CO2 emission; Resizing method; High-rise building; Sustainable structural design,SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURAL DESIGN; EMBODIED ENERGY OPTIMIZATION; REINFORCED-CONCRETE COLUMNS; WIND-INDUCED RESPONSE; CO2 EMISSIONS; TALL BUILDINGS; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; LIFE-CYCLE; MODEL; CONSTRUCTION,"Construction materials are known to cause a considerable environmental impact during their manufacturing and construction phases. The environmental impact such as CO2 emissions can be calculated based on the amount of materials used. To reduce CO2 emissions, it is necessary to develop technologies that can reduce the amount of materials used in the design phase. This study proposes a design technology that applies a resizing method to reduce the cost and carbon dioxide emissions of high-rise buildings. This technique increases the natural frequency of the structure and decreases the structural weight by reducing the wind load acting on high-rise buildings. The proposed technique is applied to a 37-story real building in order to compare the cost and CO2 emissions pre- and post-application of the technique. The cost and CO2 emissions in the phases of material manufacturing, material transportation, and on-site construction are considered. As a result of the application, it was confirmed that the redesign obtained with the proposed technique reduces the cost by 29.2% and CO2 emissions by 13.5%, when compared to the initial design.

Experimental evaluation of mechanical and thermal properties of recycled rubber membranes reinforced with crushed polyethylene particles,Rubber membrane; HDPE particles; Particles influence; Tensile strength; Environmental damage,HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; TIRE RUBBER; ASPHALT MIXTURES; CONCRETE,"Recycled rubber powder from shredded End of Life Tyres (ELTs) has been used for the development of a new membrane as sustainable construction material. However, due to the environmental exposure of this recycled rubber membrane, climate conditions may contribute to premature deterioration of the material, reducing their mechanical strength and durability over time. To improve it, crushed particles from recycled High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) pellets can be added in the rubber matrix. Particles addition in composite materials are known for enhancing their physical and mechanical behaviour, although it is not clear how this influence works in this specific case. For these reasons, physical, mechanical and thermal behaviour of particle-reinforced rubber membranes conditioned under different environmental states have been studied. With these purposes, four different membranes with the same rubber powder gradation, but with four different percentages of crushed polyethylene particles and preconditioned under four different environmental conditions (dry, water-saturated, cold and ageing) have been considered. The influence of polyethylene particles on the mechanical behaviour of the membranes has been evaluated using tensile strength tests. Additionally, the heat transfer capacity of the membranes has been measured through thermal conductivity tests. Main results of the study showed that polyethylene particles reduced the bulk density of the membranes but increased the air voids content. Moreover, it was found that the crushed polyethylene particles can form channels inside the membranes that reinforce the structure of the composite material. However, probability analysis results proved that HDPE particles did not significantly contribute to improve tensile mechanical properties of the membranes evaluated under different environmental conditions. Finally, the HDPE particles addition increased the thermal conductivity of the membranes, but with low heat-transfer ability, so these membranes have potential uses with thermal facing purposes.

Utilization of catalyzed waste vegetable oil as a binder for the production of environmentally friendly roofing tiles,Catalyzed Vege-Roofing tile; Catalyst; CO2 emission; Embodied carbon; Embodied energy; Waste vegetable oil,CONCRETE; CARBONATION,"Climate change has become a major issue in recent years owing to the emission of greenhouse gases. Mitigation measures are required to overcome the challenges pertained to greenhouse gases emissions. This research paper attributes to the utilization of catalyzed waste vegetable oil as a binder for the production of roofing tiles to replace the conventional construction materials such as clay and cement A novel methodology of utilizing catalyzed waste oil incorporated with sand and filler was adopted and the innovative product produced is entitled as catalyzed Vege-Roofing tiles that discovered to be economical and environmentally friendly in contrast to the traditional binders. It is believed that an extended heat curing of vegetable oil resulted in a complex oxy-polymerization reaction converting it into a rigid binder. Triplicate prototypes samples were manufactured to optimize the final conditions for the fabrication of catalyzed Vege-Roofing tiles. Optimized conditions were then implemented to produce standard catalyzed Vege-Roofing tiles and these fabricated tiles have shown flexural stress of up to 12 MPa for 18 h of curing. Moreover, these novel tiles were tested for permeability and water absorption according to the ASTM standards and have shown impermeability and remarkably low water absorption. Progressively, the embodied energy and embodied carbon requirements for these tiles found to be 0.64 MJ/kg and 0.327 kg CO2 per equivalent respectively which is quite less in comparison to the traditional binders. Conclusively, environmentally friendly and economic production of tiles, conservation of existing resources and overcoming the issue of waste management are the remarkable outcomes of this research.

Detection and Monitoring of Gap in Concrete-Based Composite Structures Using Microwave Dual Waveguide Sensor,Non-destructive testing and monitoring; dual waveguide sensor; dielectric permittivity; reflection coefficient; transmission coefficient; concrete composite structures; gap; measurement error; simulation,CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; SYSTEM; REFLECTION; INSPECTION; COLUMNS,"A recently developed microwave dual waveguide sensor is applied for the measurement of gap in concrete-based composites in this paper. The sensor includes two waveguide sections embedded in a metal plate and opened in the structure under test. A transceiver that generates, transmits, and receives microwave signals, and a measurement unit that measures reflection and transmission coefficients is the other components of the sensor measurement system. The sensor is designed, built, and tested with concrete-metal and concrete-dielectric layer-metal specimens. Then, the sensor with the specimens has been modeled using Computer Simulation Technology Microwave Studio. Extensive simulations are performed to determine the complex dielectric permittivity of concrete in the area of measurement from the measured data, and to carry out the parametric study of concrete-based composites. It is demonstrated that the measurement and simulation results are in good agreement. It is also shown that the proposed system can measure relatively small gaps (0.2-2 mm) in the concrete based composite structures at the X-band. Measurement and simulation results show that the proposed sensor can be used for detection and evaluation of gap in composite structures, such as concrete-filled steel tubes and concrete members covered by dielectric coatings.",2017

Concrete containing 20% of fly ash (FA) is prepared and the binder is replaced with TDFA (Tire Derived Fuel Ash) from 3.0 to 12.0% by weight. The mechanical and durability performance in the concrete with FA and TDFA are evaluated considering the replacement ratio of TDFA, which is the 1st study on TDFA application to concrete as a binder in South Korea. For the work, various tests are performed for quantitative durability evaluation like compressive strength, carbonation resistance, accelerated chloride diffusion, and freezing/thawing action. In order to investigate pore structure and additionally generated compounds, micro observation tests with MIP (Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), and XRD (X-ray Diffraction) are also performed. Despite of replacement of TDFA with high Braine and abundant CaO, concrete with TDFA can provide a reasonable improvement in durability due to packing effect. The durability improvement in FA-based concrete with varying TDFA replacement is comprehensively evaluated and the related mechanism is also studied through micro observation tests.

Effects of red mud and Alkali-Activated Slag Cement on efflorescence in cement mortar,Efflorescence; AASC; Red mud; Alkali activator; Binder effect,HYDRATION; CONCRETE,"Recently AASC (Alkali Activated Slag Cement) is utilized for construction materials in order to reduce environmental load like abundant CO2 emission. Red mud which is a byproduct from Bauxite ores process has a strong alkali component containing 10.0-15.0% of Na2O, so that it can be used for an alkali activator or retarder for cement hydration. This work presents an evaluation of efflorescence characteristics in cement mortar with AASC and red mud. For the work, OPC (Ordinary Portland Cement) and AASC are used as matrix binder, and varying replacement ratios of red mud (0.0-30%) are prepared. In order to evaluate the efflorescence characteristics in the binders with red Mud, analysis of water absorption and porosity are performed. The changing efflorescence areas with weight loss are also measured. The compounds in efflorescence are quantitatively analyzed through various techniques such as EDS, XRD, SEM, TGA, and alkali leaching test. In the work, the accelerated efflorescence mechanism and its characteristics are quantitatively evaluated considering the effects of binder types and red mud replacement ratios.

Influence of construction material uncertainties on residential building LCA reliability,Building LCA; Uncertainties; Relative contribution,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; ENERGY BUILDINGS,"Life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely used to evaluate the environmental impacts of buildings, but due to uncertainties, the final results can be unreliable. To increase the reliability of LCA results, this study identifies the building materials that have the largest relative contribution to buildings' impacts and uncertainties. To do so, the impacts of 15 single-family houses and 15 multi-family building projects situated in France are evaluated. Only the uncertainties related to input parameters for building materials are considered (service life, characterization factors and quantity). The results obtained in this study show that LCA will still be able to distinguish significantly between two projects if their difference is higher than approximately 20%. Furthermore, the impacts of the buildings' exploitation phase do not show any correlations with the impacts related to the construction Materials. The exploitation phase dominates the non-renewable energy consumption while waste impacts are most influenced by building materials. The contribution to global warming potential is shared between both phases. Finally, reinforced concrete was identified as the largest contributor to the environmental impact of both building types. In contrast, insulation materials and non-structural wood were the largest contributors to the uncertainties of the final results for single-family houses and multi-family buildings, respectively.

Study on the behaviour of rubber aggregates concrete beams using analytical approach,Rubber aggregates; Method of initial functions; Beams,INITIAL FUNCTIONS; PLATES,"Concrete is one the most extensively used construction material all over the world. Many scientists and researchers are in quest for developing alternate construction material that are environment friendly and contribute towards sustainable development. Huge amount of rubber tyres waste is being generated day by day which creates the disposal problem and has many environmental issues. As this scrap rubber waste is an elastic material having less specific gravity, energy absorbent material can be used as a replacement material for obtaining lightweight concrete. In present study an attempt is made to partially replace the rubber aggregates by coarse aggregates in concrete and to study its impact on properties of concrete. A modified concrete is prepared by replacing coarse aggregates in concrete with rubber aggregates by varying the replacement proportion from 0% to 20% with increment of 5%. 3 cubes for each percentage of replacement are casted and tested after 28th days of curing. The physiomechanical properties like density, compressive strength and elastic properties of modified concrete are determined from concrete cubes experimentally and further stresses and displacement at every 50 mm depth of beams are determined analytically by method of initial functions (MIF). MIF is an analytical method in which elastic properties and theoretical loads are used to analyse the beams without conducting any experimental programme. The analytical results by MIF are compared with bending theory. (C) 2016 Karabuk University. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

Facile preparation of sulfur polymer cement via low-temperature curing,Sulfur polymer; Cement; Viscosity; Bending strength,ELEMENTAL SULFUR; CONCRETE; COPOLYMERIZATION; AGGREGATE,"Sulfur has been considered as one of the promising construction materials because of its excellent mechanical and chemical properties, and ease of abundant production. However, there are some challenges for revealing high performance of sulfur materials due to their rigidity and shrinkage. While polymerized sulfur has been suggested as an alternative, the conventional process to synthesize sulfur polymer (SP) is unfavorable for practical applications due to the explosive reaction. Here, we report a facile route to prepare a SP without exothermic reaction through a post-curing process of the as-prepared SP. The reaction between sulfur and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) was carried out within 10 min at 140 degrees C to form a precursor of the SP, followed by solidification at room temperature. The as-prepared SP was again heated to 120 degrees C for curing process. The cured SP cement (SPC) exhibited the decreased viscosity and increased bending strength compared to conventionally prepared SPC regardless of the reaction time.",2017

Abstract Active bending of hardened concrete plates for the construction of spatially curved surfaces The utilization of concrete as construction material can be increased sharply by optimizing the form of the structure according to impacting loads. The particular forms found can exemplarily be concrete shells and have a free formed geometry in most cases requiring a complex mold to be produced. One approach invented at the TU Wien is to simplify the production by bending initially flat hardened concrete plates to single and double curved structures. The core of the construction method is the bending process itself. The concrete as well as the reinforcement have to be able to absorb the occurring strains. The bending properties of 50 mm thick concrete plates could already be determined in previous test series and the practical functionality of the new approach could already be successfully tested in two large scale experiments. In the first experiment a concrete shell with 13 m diameter and a height of 3.2 m was erected. Within the second experiment a free form shell with a dimension of 10.8 m x 17.6 m and a height of 2.9 m was built. The present article describes continuing research about the bending capacity of plates with higher thickness (100-120 mm) for the application of the construction method to building a shell bridge for wildlife over a two track rail.",2017

In this paper fly ash based geopolymer concretes with different percentages of alccofme were made by mixing sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate as an alkaline activator and cured at ambient as well as heat environment in an electric oven at 90 degrees C. Effects of various parameters such as the percentage of alccofme, curing temperature, a period of curing, fly ash content, was studied on compressive strength as well as workability of geopolymer concrete. The study concludes that the presence of alccofme improves the properties of geopolymer concrete during a fresh and hardened state of concrete. Geopolymer concrete in the presence of alccofme can be used for the general purpose of concrete as required compressive strength can be achieved even at ambient temperature.

Assessing the economic impact and ecological footprint of construction and demolition waste during the urbanization of rural land,Ecological footprint; Economic impact; Urbanization; Waste,BUILDING CONSTRUCTION; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; MANAGEMENT; INDICATORS; PROJECTS; SPAIN; SUSTAINABILITY; METHODOLOGY; MAINTENANCE; SYSTEM,"The present work"" analyses the management of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) in urbanization projects from a dual perspective: ecological and economic, A well-established model for waste quantification, previously developed by the authors, is employed and adapted for the assessment of urbanization work. The quantification model is based on the work breakdown system (WBS) of construction budgets. Five urbanization projects are evaluated; two are industrial and three residential. The quantities, budget, and ecological footprint (EF) are determined. The EF evaluation follows the same methodology as defined by the authors for construction projects but with several new incorporations, such as the quantification for the felling of trees and the machinery footprint. The result shows that 98% of the C&DW generated is due to earthworks and tree felling. An overwhelming 97% of the EF is due to fuel consumption by on-site machinery and construction materials. Finally,a new scenario is proposed in which the soil is 100% reused and the inert waste is crushed and used as concrete aggregate, which reduces the EF by more than 20%, in all cases analysed. The results show that it is possible to quantify the integral impact within construction projects of the application of recycling and of reuse strategies by means of a WBS. Finally, from a construction project perspective, the traditional model for waste management and economic control can be completed with an environmental analysis using the EF indicatpr.

The desalination treatments currently used in order to mitigate this alteration process are usually applied directly on the affected areas, which have often a low degree of cohesion precisely due to the deteriorating effect of the salts. The present study aimed to investigate the evaluation of a new approach based on electrokinetic techniques to desalinate rocks in monuments, specifically to desalinate carved reliefs. The procedure avoids the direct contact with the areas highly affected by salts, which usually show loss of cohesion due to salt crystallization processes, by placing the electrodes on adjacent areas less contaminated with salts. This fact represents another difficulty in the desalination process because the electric field must be adapted to the shape of the sculptural motif. An ashlar of sandstone highly contaminated with salts in a protruded area located in its central part was used for this purpose. The results showed that the electrokinetic setup proposed allowed to achieve high percentages of salt content reduction ( above 80 %) in the protruded area of the sandstone highly contaminated with salts. Therefore, these results confirmed that it was possible to desalinate the sandstone using electrokinetic methods without the need to put in contact the affected areas with the equipment, reducing the possibility of altering it by manipulation.",2017
Quantitative evaluation of free CaO in electric furnace slag using the ethylene glycol method,Steel slag; Electric arc furnace slag; Free CaO; Ethylene glycol; Concrete; Aggregates; Expansion,STEEL SLAG; PORTLAND-CEMENT; CONCRETE; AGGREGATE; PERFORMANCE; EXPANSION; TEMPERATURE; DURABILITY; DUST; LIME,"Worldwide increase in the amount of slag production, a by-product of steel manufacturing, has led to efforts to recycle the slag into value-added products. However, the presence of unstable constituents like free CaO limits the applications of electric furnace slag, which is stabilized by the aging process. Herein, by measuring the free CaO content as a function of aging period, source region, company, and storage position, using the ethylene glycol method, the feasibility of using electric furnace slag as a construction material is confirmed. The free CaO contents of electric furnace oxidizing slag (EOS) samples were found to be below 0.5%. This satisfies the criteria specified in KS F 4571, which states that the CaO content should be below 40% and CaO/SiO2 ratio should be below 2.0. In addition, it was confirmed that free CaO content difference appears to be dependent on the aging period and storage position. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017

This has become not only the cause of natural resources depletion at an alarming rate but also gradually becoming a challenge for sustainability. Concrete industry consumes a majority of natural resources especially in developing countries. In recent years the concrete industry has started using Construction and Demolition (C&D) waste in structural concrete application owing to the availability of waste from demolition of old structures and the reduction in cost of acquiring aggregates. This can allow the concrete industry to reduce its carbon footprint and thus help it to continue to grow without harming the environment. In this backdrop, this paper provides an account of properties of concrete prepared with recycled aggregate, analyses the important findings on Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) in the recent time and discusses the suitability of its usage in construction. The open literature suggests that the durability and mechanical properties of RAC is slightly inferior than that of conventional concrete. However, with the use of admixtures and modified mixing approaches, the desired properties of RAC can be obtained. Collation and analysis of more than 200 research papers in this area on various facts of Recycled Aggregate Concrete, on one hand, may be considered as a step ahead for formation of design methodology and, on the other hand, a valuable stating document for further research.

However, the in situ cracking inside such specimens cannot be visualized using traditional optical imaging methods since the materials are opaque. In this study, the in situ sub-surface failure/damage mechanisms in Cor-Tuf (a reactive powder concrete), a high-strength concrete (HSC) and Indiana limestone under dynamic loading were investigated using high-speed synchrotron X-ray phase-contrast imaging. Dynamic compressive loading was applied using a modified Kolsky bar and fracture images were recorded using a synchronized high-speed synchrotron X-ray imaging set-up. Three-dimensional synchrotron X-ray tomography was also performed to record the microstructure of the specimens before dynamic loading. In the Cor-Tuf and HSC specimens, two different modes of cracking were observed: straight cracking or angular cracking with respect to the direction of loading. In limestone, cracks followed the grain boundaries and voids, ultimately fracturing the specimen. Cracks in HSC were more tortuous than the cracks in Cor-Tuf specimens. The effects of the microstructure on the observed cracking behaviour are discussed.

With the growth in urbanization and industrialization, the demand for concrete is increasing day by-days. Therefore, raw materials and natural resources are required in large quantities for concrete production worldwide. At the same time, a considerable quantity of industrial waste, agricultural waste and other types of solid material disposal are posing serious environmental issues. To minimize and reduce the negative impact of the concrete industry through the explosive usage of raw materials, the use of artificial wastes as supplementary cementitious materials, the source of which are both reliable and suitable for alternative preventive solutions promotes the environmental sustainability of the industry.

The zeolite types and activation parameters were altered during the experiment with an aim to determine the optimal combination that would produce powder with adequate physico-chemical and microstructural properties for application as a binder replacement and an ion -exchanger in the construction composites. The effects of input variables (chemical composition of the samples) and process parameters (the rotor velocity and the activation period) on the efficiency of zeolite activation were investigated in terms of dependent parameters such as: specific surface area, grain size distribution, cation exchange capacity, melting point, compression strength, shrinking, water absorption and apparent porosity. Cluster analysis, Principal component analysis and Standard score analysis were applied in the assessment of the acquired product quality. Artificial neural networks (ANN) were developed in mathematical modeling of observed responses. Subsequently the ANN was compared to experimental results and the developed second order polynomial models. Developed models showed r(2) values in the 0.822-0.998 range, meaning that they were able to predict the observed responses in a wide range of processing parameters. ANN models performed high prediction accuracy (0.975-0.993) and can be considered as precise and very useful for response variables prediction. The combination of the conducted mathematical analyses isolated Z5 zeolite as a preferable type, and 20000 rpm and 30 min as an optimal activation set of parameters. Mathematically derived conclusions were confirmed by results of instrumental analyses (XRD, DTA/TG, SEM). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
Developing a CO2-e accounting method for quantification and analysis of embodied carbon in high-rise buildings,Construction material; Embodied carbon; Green procurement; High-rise building; Life cycle assessment; Low carbon building,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; STEEL-INDUSTRY; EMISSION REDUCTION; HONG-KONG; ENERGY; IRON; DESIGN; TECHNOLOGIES; CHALLENGES; THAILAND,"Considerable amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in buildings are embodied carbon from the manufacturing processes and transportation of various construction materials. Reduction of embodied carbon in buildings becomes important in the context of limiting GHG emissions into atmosphere. However, previous studies focused on analysis of low-rise buildings while high-rise buildings were seldom evaluated. Therefore, this study aims to develop a method used for the quantification and analysis of embodied carbon in high-rise buildings. The proposed method is used to evaluate the impacts of different procurement strategies (e.g., the choice of material manufacturing processes, the amounts of recycled steel scrap and cement substitutes, and the source locations), based on a case study of embodied carbon for a 60-story composite core-outrigger reference building (i.e., the most commonly-used structure in high-rise building design). The results show that structural steel and rebar from traditional blast furnace account for 80% of the embodied carbon in the core-outrigger building, while ready mixed concrete contributes only 20%. If steel is produced from electric arc furnace with 100% recycled steel scrap as the feedstock, the embodied carbon of the building can be reduced by over 60%. As for ready-mixed concrete, 10-20% embodied carbon reduction in buildings can be achieved by utilizing cement substitutes (35% fly ash or 75% slag). However, using concrete with large amounts of cement substitutes has longer setting periods and affects the construction time. In projects with strict construction schedules, contractors may use less cement substitutes, leading to increased embodied carbon emissions in buildings. When large amounts of recycled steel and cement substitutes are used in construction, the carbon emissions from transportation can increase up to 20% of the embodied carbon in a building. In such cases, a trade-off analysis considering both the embodied carbon and the material availability is needed in order to determine the optimal source locations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Rheology of Green Self-Consolidated Concrete (GSCC) with Ternary Blend under Coupled Effects of Temperature and Prolonged Mixing,,,"The fresh quality of a concrete mixture subjected to high temperature and prolonged mixing is adversely affected. These harsh conditions would result in a stiff concrete that is hard to handle and place. This paper investigates the coupled effects of temperature and prolonged mixing on green self-consolidating concrete (GSCC) incorporating a ternary blend of fly ash and silica fume. This study was carried out in the construction material laboratory of Abu Dhabi University under an outdoor environment during the summer of 2014. The SCC mixtures were continuously mixed for 110 minutes at a temperature ranging from 25 to 40 degrees C to simulate the actual conditions of concrete during transporting to a construction site. The fresh properties were tested using BT2 portable rheometer, slump flow, T-50 and visual stability index (VSI). The results showed that the ternary blend of silica fume and fly ash enhanced the rheological properties of SCC mixtures under high temperature and prolonged mixing time.",2017

Utilizing Slurry and Carwash Wastewater as Fresh Water Replacement in Concrete Properties,,,"The high demand for concrete production generates wastewater which causes environmental problems. However, if wastewater is able to be recycled as part of engineering construction materials, many benefits can be reaped. Unfortunately, the use of wastewater in manufacturing concrete is not common. Therefore, this research aims to identify the influence of using slurry water and car wash wastewater on concrete properties, focusing particularly on its mechanical properties. The basic characteristics of wastewater were studied according to USEPA method while the properties of concrete with wastewater were compared according to ASTM C1602 and BS EN 1008 standards. In this paper, the compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and tensile strength were examined in order to determine the mechanical properties of concrete. The wastewater was replaced in the concrete mix from 0% up to 40%. The results indicated that the characteristics of wastewater complied with the BS and ASTM standards. In addition, the results also recommended that the concrete mixture with 20% of wastewater has given the highest compressive strength and modulus of elasticity.",2017
Strength Properties of Foamed Concrete Containing Crushed Steel Slag as Partial Replacement of Sand with Specific Gradation,,,"Lightweight construction material, notably foamed concrete, had become more favourable to reduce building weight and cost, accelerate construction process, and ease handling of precast segment. Simultaneously, rapid development had result in price rising of conventional material and environmental issue due to abundant wastes, for instance steel slag. As a consequence, feasibility of steel slag to be incorporated in lightweight foamed concrete for both structural and nonstructural purpose is worth to be investigated. This paper is aimed to evaluate the effects of crushed steel slag, as partial replacement of sand with specific gradation, on performance of lightweight foamed concrete (LFC) with density of 1600 kg/m(3) to 1700 kg/m(3) in terms of compressive and tensile strengths. Different steel slag based LFCs were developed by replacing 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% of steel slag for sand. Different water to cement ratios (w/c) and dosages of super-plasticizer (sp) were adopted to confirm certain workability, strength properties was then studied for ages of 7 and 28 days. The laboratory results showed that lightweight foamed concrete with incorporation of crushed steel slag has decreased strength; however it still achieves structural strength of 17 MPa when replacement level is less than 25% at density of 1600 kg/m(3) to 1700 kg/m(3).",2017

The expense and pressure of air in the systems are overstated during their design to avoid the blockage of pipelines. As a result, the energy consumption of the equipment increases. At the same time, the equipment wear is accelerated and the systems are operated on the unstable modes. Therefore, the operational reliability of such equipment decreases and the process of cleaning of the exhaust air becomes complicated.

Thermal Insulation System for Energy Efficient Green Buildings in Tropical Countries,,,"Building construction has gone through tremendous changes during the last decade. With the improvement in quality of life, earnings, living style, the building construction methodology and construction materials have been modified to suit the life style of people. The art of living has changed and human comfort is given a lot of importance. With the increase in electronic gadgets in the houses along with air conditioning system, energy consumption becomes enormous. It is in this context of energy consumption and human comfort, the function of Insulation in buildings has become an important construction element. Thermal insulation is directly linked to human comfort and reducing energy consumption. Insulation system is a composite of materials and endeavours provisions of how it is applied with various holding systems to provide a building envelope. Thermal insulation is a combination of insulation and ancillary materials which creates a barrier to the flow of heat and cold from the environment to the inside of buildings. The insulation after application on roof and wall needs to be properly covered with a permanent finishing arrangement. Insulation is applied both from inside the building as well as on the external side of the building. When insulation system is applied on external side the effect is much more because insulation then covers the basic construction elements of roof and wall. This way the Reinforced Cement Concrete roof and Brick wall is never exposed to direct environment heat rays or cold wave. Whereas in the case of application from inside it has to be properly protected by solid barriers because the roof and wall will be in direct contact with human being.",2017

Firstly, durability of bamboo composite material and effectiveness of protective epoxy coating were evaluated by subjecting samples to various corrosive environments normally encountered during the life span of construction materials. At accelerated conditions, samples were immersed in water, simulated acidic rain solution and simulated concrete pore water solution for 28 days. Tensile tests and microstructural analysis were conducted to investigate the impact of different corrosive environments on the bamboo composite material's behavior. The results revealed that the application of epoxy coating successfully protected bamboo composite material's integrity without substantially affecting its mechanical capacity, particularly in acidic environment. Secondly, bond strength between bamboo composite material and concrete was investigated through pull-out tests. The epoxy coating improved the bond strength, especially with addition of sand particles. The findings of this study suggest that epoxy coating can be an effective approach to simultaneously enhance the bamboo composite material's resistance towards acid attack and improve its bond strength with concrete for concrete reinforcement application.

Analysis and Measurement of Attenuation Constants of Ultra Wideband Signal through Commonly Used Building Materials,,,"Modern wireless communication systems are operated in the ultra wideband range due to its wide bandwidth and low power of operation. Even today many aspects related to UWB propagation are not deeply investigated. Investigations are still required for interference effects, channel properties, antenna systems used at this frequency range. Investigations into the effect of the propagation of UWB signals through walls, bricks and other construction materials are an important area to be considered, since the signal propagation depends on the material through which it is passing. Hence it is an important aspect to be considered for investigation, since the waves propagate from outdoor to indoor and vice versa. The building materials we use today must possess ultra wideband width to pass these signals without attenuation and distortion. Propagation of UWB signals from indoor to outdoor and vice versa depends on the material properties for the frequency range used. In this paper, the proposed method consists of measuring the receiving signal with and without the material under test and obtains a transfer function related to attenuation constants of the materials. Measurements in the frequency domain for the transfer function are obtained using Vector Network Analyzer. The building materials that are considered for measurement are cloth partition, clay bricks, plywood, concrete, and glass. The experiments conducted have analyzed material characteristics of common building materials used in homes and offices. The knowledge of signal attenuation is highly beneficial for the analysis of automated indoor wireless installation systems.",2017
Study of the pore solution and the microstructure of mineral additions blended cement pastes,cement pastes; microstructure; pore solution; extraction; chemical analyses,ALKALI-SILICA; FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; MIGRATION; MERCURY,"In this paper, the influence of mineral additions on the microstructure and the chemical composition of the pore solution of cementitious materials is investigated. For this purpose, hardened cement pastes based on Portland cement CEM I are used. In order to study the influence of the cementitious materials composition on their microstructure and pore solution, a part of the cement is substituted by different mineral additions (limestone filler, fly ash, blast furnace slag and silica fumes). Experimental tests covered measurement of chloride diffusion coefficient by migration test and water and mercury porosimetry. Furthermore, pore solutions are extracted by pressing from cement pastes and analyzed by ionic chromatography. Results show that the substitution of cement by mineral addition modifies the total porosity and the pore sizes distribution of the blended cement pastes tested. Chemical analyses showed that all the tested pore solutions are mainly composed by sodium and potassium. A significant concentration of divalent ions, such as sulfates and calcium, is also noticed. The substitution of cement by mineral addition also significantly modifies the pore solution of cement pastes. In fact, a substitution of cement by 10% of silica fume decreases the alkalis concentrations and increases the sulfates and calcium ones. Thus, the divalent species (Ca2+ and SO42-) should be taken into account for the chloride diffusion modelling unlike the current models of the literature. Results of this chemical investigation could be used as initial and boundary conditions in the modeling of aggressive species transport through porous construction materials. (C) 2017 The Authors.

BAMBOO CONCRETE SHELLS An Adaptable Construction Method Using Onsite Materials in a Remote Location,Bamboo; natural material; digital construction,,"This paper proposes an on site construction support system using digital techniques to solve the issue of logistical inconvenience on remote islands, where industrialized construction methods are absent. Transporting heavy machinery is costly and difficult in isolated rural areas. In addition, introducing materials from outside creates a heavy ecological footprint when building. Locally produced construction materials resolve many of these issues. To test the potential of building within these constraints a case study site on an isolated island of Japan, named Kuchinoerabu, was chosen. A concrete shell structure was created using locally sourced bamboo as reinforcement. Through the study, several technical issues are revealed. Significantly, there is broad variation in the material properties of bamboo, and reducing errors when using unskilled labor is difficult. The system nominally manages the following functions: 1) Synchronizing data between CAD and the materialized form; 2) Checking errors between the target form and the one that was actually produced; 3) Inputting material characteristics on site. 4) Making a structural analysis, and reflecting its execution during construction. These functions minimize the margin of error, and aid an unskilled labor force to work more accurately.",2017

Geotechnical and environmental behaviors of MC-IBA matrix were evaluated. Firstly, the shear strength was tested. Pozzolanic reaction between the two raw materials and stabilizer was explained as the possible reason for strength development of matrix. Then, various leaching tests were performed to study heavy metal leaching behavior. Characterization leaching test NEN 7371, compliance leaching tests EN-12475, toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and long term leaching test multiple TCLP (MTCLP) were employed. Compliance tests results were compared with selected European criteria and Singapore criteria for environment assessment. The comparison shows that Singapore IBA could be accepted as non-hazardous waste under EU landfill directive. Recycled MC-IBA matrix material was qualified as construction material based on Denmark and German environmental criteria. In addition, the long term environmental concerns were also proposed based on MTCLP result analysis. It was notable that, unlike most of others elements, Ba and Tl started leaching in later stage.

Ultimate strength capacity of a square hollow section filled with fibrous foamed concrete,,LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE CONCRETE; AXIAL-COMPRESSION; STUB COLUMNS,"Concrete-filled sections used as building columns have become popular due to their architectural and structural elements. In recent years, there has been a renewed call for the improvement of materials used as concrete to fill the composite columns. Among these materials, foamed concrete has received great attention due to its structural characteristics and its potential as a construction material used in hollow sections. However, its behaviors as infill material in a hollow section, such as its strength and failure mode, should be investigated. In this study, experimental research was conducted to compare the experimental and theoretical values of its ultimate strength capacity. Eight specimens of hollow steel sections with two different thicknesses were filled with fibrous foamed concrete and then subjected to compression load. The obtained results were compared with those obtained from a hollow section with the same thicknesses, but were filled with normal foamed concrete. Results show that the ultimate strength capacity of the experimental value is the same as that of the theoretical value based on Eurocode 4.

The test results revealed that 1%, 3% and 5% of CSP concrete achieved a compressive strength of 47.65MPa, 45.6MPa and 40.55% respectively. The rate of water absorption of CSP concrete was recorded as 3.21%, 2.47%, and 2.73% for 1%, 3% and 5% of CSP concrete respectively. Although CSP contained a carbon composition of 47%, the carbonation test showed that CSP no signs of carbon were detected inside the concrete. To conclude, CSP offers great prospects as it demonstrated relatively high durability as a construction material.",2017
Review of palm oil fuel ash and ceramic waste in the production of concrete,,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,"High demand for cement in the concrete production has been increased which become the problems in the industry. Thus, this problem will increase the production cost of construction material and the demand for affordable houses. Moreover, the production of Portland cement leads to the release of a significant amount of CO2 and other gases leading to the effect on global warming. The need for a sustainable and green construction building material is required in the construction industry. Hence, this paper presents utilization of palm oil fuel ash and ceramic waste as partial cement replacement in the production of concrete. Using both of this waste in the concrete production would benefit in many ways. It is able to save cost and energy other than protecting the environment. In short, 20% usage of palm oil fuel ash and 30% replacement of ceramic waste as cement replacement show the acceptable and satisfactory strength of concrete.",2017
A review on seashells ash as partial cement replacement,,CONCRETE,"This review paper emphasis on various sea shells ash such as cockle, clam, oyster, mollusc, periwinkle, snail, and green mussel shell ash as partial cement replacement and its objective is to create sustainable environment and reduce problems of global warming. Cement production give huge impact to environment in every stage of its production. These include air pollution in form of dust and, gases, sound and vibration during quarry crushing and milling. One of the solutions to solve this problem is by using modified cement. The modified cement is a cementitious material that meets or exceeds the Portland cement performance by combining and optimizes the recycle and wasted materials. This will indirectly reduce the use of raw materials and then, become a sustain construction materials. Therefore, the replacement of cement in concrete by various sea shell ash may create tremendous saving of energy and also leads to important environmental benefits. This study includes previous investigation done on the properties of chemical and mechanical such as specific gravity, chemical composition, compressive strength, tensile strength and flexural strength of concrete produced using partial replacement of cement by seashells ash. Results show that the optimum percentage of seashells as cement replacement is between 4 - 5%.",2017
Effect of notch position on fracture energy for foamed concrete,,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE,"Foamed concrete is one of the lightweight concrete used to replace normal concrete. Foamed concrete has potential as a building construction material in Malaysia due to low density range. However, the behavior of fracture energy on foamed concrete still under investigation. Therefore, a study to determine the fracture energy of foamed concrete was conducted. In this study, foamed concrete fracture energy was obtained using the three-point bending test methods develop by RILEM and Hillerborg. A total of 12 beams with different types of notch and positions of notch were tested on the load deflection condition. In addition, a total of 9 cube samples were cast to support the result of fracture energy by using model from Bazant and Becq-Giraudon and Comite Euro-International du Beton (CEB). Results showed the far the position of the notch from midpoint, the higher the value of fracture energy. In this study, the value of fracture energy ranges between 15 N/m and 40 N/m.",2017
Corrosion Current Level Estimation of Rust Samples using Inverse Dielectric Spectroscopy,dielectric properties; corrosion; rust; microwave; corrosion current level,ALPHA-FE2O3; CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR,"Dielectric spectroscopy is a standard technique used for characterizing the energy storage and dissipation properties of dielectrics and has been applied for a wide range of fields in science and engineering. In civil engineering, dielectric properties of construction materials can be used for quality assurance (e.g., mechanical strength) and structural health monitoring (e.g., corrosion detection). In the corrosion detection problem of reinforced concrete structures, level of corrosion current is crucial to the accurate estimation of corrosion level (amount of rust) and is typically challenging to measure without destructively damaging the integrity of concrete. In this paper, a new technique based on inverse dielectric spectroscopy is proposed to estimate the current level in artificial corrosion. To achieve the goal, artificially accelerated corrosion products (rust samples) were developed. In artificially accelerated corrosion experiment, three externally supplied corrosion current levels (0.25 A, 0.50 A, and 0.75 A) were applied to steel specimens inside a corrosion reactor, and the rust samples were collected for dielectric spectroscopy measurement (dielectric constant and loss factor) in the microwave frequency range of 0.5 similar to 4.5 GHz using a dielectric coaxial probe (Agilent 85070E) and a network analyzer (Agilent E5071C). An inverse dielectric spectroscopy model incorporating loss factor, measurement frequency and corrosion current level was developed from the artificially corroded rust samples. From our experimental result, it is found that i) the higher the corrosion current level, the lower the dielectric constant and loss factor of artificial rust in the measured frequency range; and ii) corrosion current level inside artificial rust can be estimated by using an inverse dielectric spectroscopy model.",2017
Application of composite reinforcement for modernization of buildings and structures,,CRIMPED END-FITTINGS; CONCRETE; INSULATORS; GLASS,"Properties of new reinforcing element - composite reinforcement, are considered. Feasibility study of using this material for modernization of buildings, namely for vertical extension with additional storey, is carried out. Comparative analysis of performance is conducted for metal and composite reinforcement, as well as calculations are performed which results will be used for determination of advantages and disadvantages of this innovative reinforcing method. An important factor for development of projects of building vertical extension after quite a long operation period is a proper selection of construction materials and strength analysis considering the structures to be erected. Calculation of a floor slab erected with using composite fiberglass reinforcement is represented. Results obtained in the calculation and the analysis of the data prove high efficiency of this reinforcing method through the decrease of loads on lower storeys of the building, economic feasibility and other factors.",2017
Justification of application of new types of fastening of slopes of hydraulic engineering constructions,,,"The article represents the analysis of various types of fastenings of the soil slopes which have found broad application in the hydrotechnical construction practice for the last 10-15 years. It is noted that, generally, new types of fastenings represent composite materials made of concrete, metal and polymers. Experience shows that producers of the construction materials used in bank protection designs seek to recommend them for the solution of a wide range of tasks, at the same time it isn't always founded. The authors, on the basis of the analysis of experience with the types of fastenings and also modern domestic and foreign recommendations about their design and construction, offer a technique of justification of new types of fastenings of slopes of hydraulic engineering constructions. The use of concrete filled geotextile mats in bank protection is brought out as a practical realization of the represented technique.",2017
Performance of Lightweight Natural-Fiber Reinforced Concrete,Super Lightweight Concrete; Natural-fibers; compressive; tensile strength,,"Concrete, the most common construction material, has negligible tension capacity. However, a reinforcement material such as natural fibers, can be used to improve the tensile properties of concrete. This paper presents experiments conducted on Super Lightweight Concrete mixed with coconut fibers (SLNFRC). Coconut fibers are regarded as one of the toughest natural fibers to strengthen concrete. Coconut fiber reinforced composites have been considered as a sustainable construction material because the fibers are derived from waste. These wastes, which are available in large quantities in Asia, have to be extracted from the husk of coconut fruits and must pass a mechanical process before being added to a concrete mixture. The Super Lightweight Concrete was made by mixing concrete paste with foam agent that can reduce the overall weight of concrete up to 60% with compressive strength up to 6 MPa. The Super Lightweight Concrete is intended to be used for non-structural walls, as alternative conventional construction materials such as brick walls. The influence of coconut fibers content in increasing the flexural tensile strength of Super Lightweight Concrete was studied in this research. The fiber content studied include 0%, 0.1%, 0.175%, and 0.25% by weight of cement content. Sixteen specimens of SLNFRC mini beams of 60 mm x 60 mm x 300 mm were tested to failure to investigate their flexural strengths. The optimum percent fibers yielding higher tensile strength was found to be 0.175%",2017
Mechanical properties of lightweight aggregate concrete reinforced with soda can waste fibre,,,"The use of lightweight concrete as building construction material can reduce the building's self-weight and its vulnerability to earthquakes. This paper presents an experimental study on the mechanical properties of lightweight aggregate concrete reinforced with soda can waste fibre. The addition of the fibres may help prevent environmental damage. Twenty-four concrete cylinder specimens with a height of 300 mm and a diameter of 150 mm were cast. The volume fraction of the fibre was varied between 0, 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9%. To facilitate the casting process, superplasticizer was added in a content of 2% by cement weight. We found that the fibrous concrete produced can be categorized as lightweight concrete with a density below 2000 kg/m(3). The mechanical property that experienced the highest improvement, amounting to 61.00%, was the split tensile strength. The optimum fibre volume fraction for better performance in terms of strength is 0.3%.",2017
Benefits Of Using Fiber on Impact Resistance of FRC Slabs,,CONCRETE,"The recent increase in terrorist attacks and natural disasters has led to increased requirements for concrete structures to be impact resistant. Concrete normally has excellent impact resistance to such extreme loads in comparison with other construction materials. Nevertheless, existing concrete structures designed without consideration of the impact or blast load with high strain rate are endangered by those unexpected extreme loads. Therefore, the impact resistances of two-way concrete slabs were studied by conducting the multiple impact test. Various fiber reinforcements (Hooked-steel fiber, straight-steel fiber) were considered as variables. In the impact test, the impact load was applied to each specimen by dropping weight on the specimen from a certain height. The applied impact load level was adjusted by changing the height of the weight. Specimens were used for impact loading test, each measuring 1,600mm long, 1,600mm wide, and 105mm thick. All slabs were doubly reinforced (top and bottom layer) and each layer in a specimen had the same reinforcement layout. The performances of the specimens under the impact load were evaluated by comparing their reaction force, deflection, and surface damage. The impact test was stopped when the measured reaction force started to decrease. Based on the impact test, it was observed that the resistance against impact load can be improved by using fiber reinforced concrete.",2017
Viscosity of plasticized sulfur-extended asphalt: two-factor sequential optimization,,,"The compounding properties of construction materials for pavements strongly depend on dynamic viscosity of the binder. The favorable class of binder is plasticized sulfur-extended asphalt. Unfortunately, the viscosity of such a binder has not been studied in detail. In the present work we have performed experimental two-factor sequential constrained optimization of the viscosity. The binders under examination were made of asphalt, sulfur and paraffin. It was revealed that the addition of sulfur and paraffin leads to a significant decrease of the dynamic viscosity. The obtained results allowed us to estimate mixture and temperature that correspond to optimal compounding properties of the sulfur-extended asphalt concrete. In particular, for plasticized asphalt concrete with 30% of sulfur and 5% of paraffin, the optimal processing temperature is 25 C-0 lower than for ordinary asphalt. Since low preparation temperatures correspond to low emission of toxic gases and low processing costs, we can consider the concretes that will be based on plasticized sulfur-extended asphalt as green paving materials.",2017
Analyzing energy consumption while heating one-layer building envelopes in conditions of intermittent heating,,,"This paper focuses on energy consumption for heating single layer building envelopes, used in conditions of intermittent heating in different physical and mechanical and thermophysical parameters of construction materials. The authors investigated several variants of single-layer building envelopes, used frequently in building practice, with different density and coefficients of building materials thermal conductivity. For each variant of a building envelope heat leakage and time spent on heating were calculated. Heating time was calculated by both exact and approximate analytical method. Then the researchers draw a graphic dependence of energy consumption on the density of the material taking this computational data as a basis. Further analysis showed that building envelopes made of lightweight aggregate concrete and porous concrete were the most energy efficient.",2017
"Hypervelocity impact testing of materials for additive construction: Applications on Earth, the Moon, and Mars",Additive Construction; Planetary Construction Materials; Hypervelocity Impact; Micrometeorite,,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Additive Construction with Mobile Emplacement project is investigating the building of infrastructure elements on planetary surfaces by 3-dimensional printing with construction materials made of in situ resources. Likewise, the United States Army Corps of Engineers' Additive Construction of Expeditionary Structures project seeks to 3-dimensionally print structures made of concrete available everywhere on Earth. These construction materials must resist failure due to micrometeorite impact and ballistic impact, respectively. Samples were tested for resistance to hypervelocity impact with a 2.0mm aluminum sphere at a velocity of 7.00 +/- 0.2km/s. Ordinary Portland Cement-bearing samples were not perforated and did not spall, including the sample that was additively constructed. This indicates printed construction material can withstand impact. The Sorel cement sample was not perforated, but fractured and spalled. Thus, Sorel cement in its current formulation would not be considered a feasible construction material for planetary structures. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2017
Thermal Properties of Light-Weight Concrete with Waste Polypropylene Aggregate,,PLASTIC WASTE; REPLACEMENT; MORTARS; CEMENT,"Thermal properties of a sustainable light-weight concrete incorporating high volume of waste polypropylene as partial substitution of natural aggregate were studied in the paper. Glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (GFPP), a by-product of PP tubes production, partially substituted fine natural silica aggregate in 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mass%. In order to quantify the effect of GFPP use on concrete properties, a reference concrete mix without plastic waste was studied as well. For the applied GFPP, bulk density, matrix density, and particle size distribution were measured. Specific attention was paid to thermal transport and storage properties of GFPP that were examined in dependence on compaction time. For the developed light-weight concrete, thermal properties were accessed using transient impulse technique, whereas the measurement was done in dependence on moisture content, from the dry state to fully water saturated state. Additionally, the investigated thermal properties were plotted as function of porosity. The tested light-weight concrete was found to be prospective construction material possessing improved thermal insulation function. Moreover, the reuse of waste plastics in concrete composition was beneficial both from the environmental and financial point of view considering plastics low biodegradability and safe disposal.",2017
The Problems of Dynamics of Wheeled Vehicles with Flow Able Building Cargo,flow able cargo; safety; dynamics; rheometry; resistance; frequency; amplitude,,"The issues of the dynamics of the wheeled vehicles transporting free-flowing construction materials (concrete, mortar, bitumen and other construction mixes) are considered. It is proved that for the purpose of safety, the oscillations of free-flowing construction materials during the vehicle movement should be taken into account. So, in general, free-flowing construction materials are non-Newtonian fluids, i.e. their flow rheograms are non-linear. If, however, we take into account the fact that during the oscillations the deformations of non-Newtonian fluids do not occur in one plane but they do in all four coordinate planes, then the hysteresis behaviour of these rheograms is natural, which is confirmed experimentally. Then the area of the hysteresis loop allows us to perform the linearization of the problem when calculating the oscillations of the dynamic system ""road-vehicle-free-flowing construction materials"". The oscillation analysis methods of the wheeled vehicles with free-flowing construction materials both in transversal and longitudinal planes have been developed, as well as the recommendations for increasing the stability of the wheeled vehicles against rollover and for reducing structural loads in transient motion mode of the vehicle have been given. The research allows us to consider the dynamics of the wheeled vehicles both with free flowing and solid construction materials in general. What is more, the case with a free-flowing construction material is comprehensive and the one with a solid material is specific. The developed methodology made it possible to implement a number of design solutions which improve the structural safety of the wheeled vehicles transporting free-flowing construction materials.

Selected Mechanical Properties Analysis of Fibrous Composites Made on the Basis of Fine Waste Aggregate,waste sand; fine aggregate; composite; steel fibres,FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE; STEEL FIBERS; CERAMIC AGGREGATE; SAND; RATIO; BEAMS; SFRC,"The presented article concerns environmental protection in terms of limiting consumption of natural resources and carbon dioxide emission. Its subject matter fits in the world-wide tendency consisted with Sustainable Ecological Development. Northern Poland area lacks of coarse aggregate, which is essential to produce ordinary concrete. In this case, in order to obtain wholesome aggregate to concrete production, it is necessary to process much more output in the form of all-in aggregate, increasing work and energy input at the same time. This procedure results in obtaining various aggregate fractions, however over 80% of it is sand with maximum granulation of 4 mm. As the result, most of sand remains unused in numerous piles located nearby the aggregate mines and is treated as post-prothiction waste. These facts made the authors of the article to propose a solution of the existing issue. Therefore, there were analyzed the results of study on sand from two mines located in northern Poland. The analysis covered grading curves, grain median, bulk density in loose state, grain density, quantity of mineral dust, voids and foreign body content. The results of conducted analysis confirmed the possibility of using waste sand as aggregate in cement composites with steel fibres. Additionally, there were also analyzed the results of previous study on mechanical properties of selected hooked steel fibres, which were 50 mm long and had 0.8 mm in diameter. The tensile strength results and the number of bends, that were obtained, were verified with the parameters declared by fibre producers. The main analysis concerned two specific fibrous composites of volumetric content of fibres of 0.42% and 1.2%. These values are considered to be minimal as well as optimal for quantity of fibres in the mixture. In case of these composites, the statistical analysis also included compression strength and tension strength at splitting, modulus of elasticity and residual strength. On the basis of this analysis the curves were proposed describing value changes in compression strength, tension strength at splitting and modulus of elasticity in function of dosed fibres quantity. The presented functions well describe variability of aforementioned qualities, what is confirmed by correlation ratio, which was between 0.76 and 0.94. There was also analysed an interdependence between loading force and crack mode opening displacement (CMOD). On its basis it was possible to determine residual strength and to establish, according to Model Code 2010, fibrous composite classes and also whether it was possible to partially replace ordinary reinforcement with fibrous composites. The results of all these analysis prove that the mechanical properties of fine aggregate composites made on the basis of waste sand with dispersed reinforcement comply with the requirements imposed on construction materials.",2017
Mechanical properties of nanocarbon modified cement,buildings concrete; CNT; cement; civil engineering; construction materials; carbon nanotubes; nanofibers,CARBON NANOTUBES; COMPOSITES; DISPERSION; BEHAVIOR; MORTAR,"This article covers use of nanocarbon modified cement (nCMC) that was made with use of chemical vapor deposition method. The tests were performed with traditional destructive method as well as with the use of special ultrasonic equipment. The specimens with nCMC was tested for compressive and tensile strength. However, the results showed that use of nCMC made only minor effect on these characteristics, when results from other research groups indicate that nCMC improves cement's properties greatly. Therefore, authors hypothesize that characteristics of nCMC modified paste matrix highly dependent on the geometrical characteristics of nanofiber such as length, type of structure (singlewalled, multi-walled) and chirality. This hypothesis is based on the ultrasonic tests' results. Furthermore, the positioning, distribution and the proportion in the material of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) needs to be researched more.",2017
EXPERIMENTAL STUDY ON THE INTERACTION EFFECT OF SULFATE IONS AND CHLORIDE IONS ON REINFORCEMENT CORROSION IN MARINE ENVIRONMENT,reinforcement corrosion; marine environment; cyclic potentialdynamic polarization; aggressive ions,CONCRETE STRUCTURES; STEEL,"Reinforced concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials for marine structures. Due to the abundance of the aggressive ions such as chloride ions and sulfate ions in the seawater, the reinforcement exposed to the marine and costal environment are exposed to a high corrosion risk. Localized corrosion will occur once the passive film on the rebar is damaged. In this work, the corrosion behavior of the steel in the simulated pore solution containing with both sulfate ions and chloride ions are studied by using cyclic potentialdynamic polarization methods and the corrosion morphologies observed using scanning electron microscope (SEM). The test results show that the initial rebar corrosion is caused by the absorption of the chloride ions in the passive film. The sulfate ions nearly had no effect on the corrosion of the rebar in pore solution and it can further mitigate the pitting corrosion in chloride containing pore solution.",2017
Performance and Characterization of Geopolymer Concrete Reinforced with Short Steel Fiber,,STRENGTH,"In the recent years, geopolymer concrete are reporting as the greener construction technology compared to conventional concrete that made up of ordinary Portland cement. Geopolymer concrete is an innovative construction material that utilized fly ash as one of waste material in coal combustion industry as a replacement for ordinary Portland cement in concrete. The uses of fly ash could reduce the carbon dioxide emission to the atmosphere, redundant of fly ash waste and costs compared to ordinary Portland cement concrete. However, the plain geopolymer concrete suffers from numerous drawbacks such as brittleness and low durability. Thus, in this study the addition of steel fiber is introduced in plain geopolymer concrete to improve its mechanical properties especially in compressive and flexural strength. Characterization of raw materials also determined by using chemical composition analysis. Short type of steel fiber is added to the mix in weight percent of 1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt% and 7 wt% with fixed molarity of sodium hydroxide of 12M and solid to liquid ratio as 2.0.

Management of Construction Waste in Nuclear and Thermal Power Plant Projects in India,Concrete structures; Infrastructure planning; Waste management; Power plant; Construction materials,,"Waste in construction is important both from the perspective of productivity and from environmental considerations. Mostly actual quantum of waste generation exceeds the percentage envisaged initially, causing needless utilization of both natural and human resources. It is understood from project and construction managers during site survey that there is plenty of scope for enhancing project productivity simply by minimizing waste out of construction and also saving the cost as well as extraction of natural resources. This paper attempts to identify the causes towards generation of waste of different types of building materials during various stages of construction in different power plant projects in India. Subsequent to identification, methods are proposed to mitigate the generation of construction wastes by adopting appropriate construction and management checks and methods, which allow waste reduction. The use of various building materials in different types of projects has different impact on the amount of waste generation, environment, and cost. Research data were gathered from the analysis of five power plant projects under construction or already completed in different states in India. The causes of such occurrences of each item and details have been analysed from the questionnaire survey and the same was processed for normalizing, data cleaning, and reliability analysis done through SPSS. The result of the first questionnaire was used along with site inputs/factual data to project the tabulation of perception versus reality. Furthermore, a second questionnaire was initiated for the validation of the above using non parametric statistic test and suitable recommendations were given to reduce wastage. The research paper reveals the major root causes for material wastage in construction of power plant projects and proper awareness to be created to the relevant project team by training.

The traditional production process of Portland cement usually generates a large amount of CO2 during decomposition; moreover, a great deal of fuel is consumed for the high temperature process. Geopolymer was introduced to compensate in cement-based concrete materials because of its low emission of CO2 and suitable strength. In this study, calcined clay mineral from Lampang province was used as a geopolymer-based material. Prior to utilization, the clay was calcined at 700 degrees C for 2 h to ensure a suitable condition for synthesis of the metakaolin phase. An amount of 30 wt% of waste glass was studied as a possibility for the reinforcement phase in the metakaolin-based geopolymer. In addition, 10 M of NaOH solution and partial NaOH replacement by 30-90 wt% of Na2SiO3 were used as the alkaline activator. Samples were cured at 60 degrees C for 7 days. Phase investigation, microstructure, and compressive strength were examined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, and universal testing machine, respectively. The results show that the compressive strength decreased from 36.83, 14.00, and 20.37 MPa related to the concentration of Na2SiO3 from 30, 60, and 90% by weight, respectively. Fourier-transform infrared spectra corresponding with the compressive strength by transformation of Si-O-Al from substitution in tetrahedral sites of Al in the Si site were also investigated. The microstructure revealed that the samples using 30% waste glass and 30% Na2SiO3 were homogeneous due to the dissolution of metakaolin.",2017

Mix design and mechanical performance of geopolymer binder for sustainable construction and building material,,CONCRETE; TECHNOLOGY; EMISSIONS; INDUSTRY,"Sustainability in construction is a major concern worldwide, due to the huge volume of materials and energy consumed by this sector. Associated supplementing industries (e.g. Portland cement production) constitute a significant source of CO2 emissions and global warming. Valorisation and reuse of industrial wastes and by-products make geopolymers a solid and sustainable via to be followed as a valid alternative to Portland cement. In this work the mix design of a green fly ash-based geopolymer is evaluated as an environmentally friendly construction material. In the pursuit of sustainability, wastes from a regional kraft pulp industry are exploited for the material processing. Furthermore, a simple, reproducible, and low-cost manufacture is used. The mix design is hence optimised in order to improve the desirable mechanical performance of the material intended for structural applications in construction. Tests indicate that geopolymers may efficiently substitute the ordinary Portland cement as a mortar/concrete binder. Furthermore, valorisation and reuse of wastes in geopolymers is a suboptimal way of gaining financial surplus for the involved industrial players, while contributes for the implementation of a desirable circular economy.",2017

The influence of carbonation process on concrete bridges and durability in Estonian practice,,,"Concrete as one of the most widely used construction material in building industry, has considerable implementing in bridge engineering due to its extensive number of effective technical characteristics. However, according to exploitation environment, there are substantial factors such as aggressive liquids (e.g. deiced salts, sulfates, etc), rapid temperature alterations and the increasing rate of CO2 to take into account predicting actual retained service life of concrete structure and the need of repairmen to increase the lifespan of the bridge. According to several measuring, concentration of atmospheric CO2 is reported linearly increasing and is modeled to appear as exponential increase in the next decade. This environmental influence leads to accelerated carbonation process of concrete and brings up the importance of its potential untimely degradation mechanism. Hence, the main aim of this research is to give an analyzed overview of the carbonation depths of selection of 11 concrete bridges in Estonia built in the period of 1976-2007 and their relation with compressive strength of concrete. In addition to in situ tests, laboratory research was performed to understand natural carbonation rate and compressive strength relations of concrete.",2017
Impact of moisture content in AAC on its heat insulation properties,,,"One of the most popular trends in construction industry is sustainable construction. Therefore, application of construction materials with high insulation characteristics has significantly increased during the past decade. Requirements for application of construction materials with high insulation parameters are required not only by means of energy saving and idea of sustainable construction but also by legislative requirements. Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a load bearing construction material, which has high heat insulation parameters. However, if the AAC masonry construction has high moisture content the heat insulation properties of the material decrease significantly. This fact lead to the necessity for the on-site control of moisture content in AAC in order to avoid inconsistency between the designed and actual thermal resistivity values of external delimiting constructions. Research of the impact of moisture content in AAC on its heat insulation properties has been presented in this paper.",2017
Use of geonics scientific positions for designing of building composites for protective (fortification) structures,,,"The examples of the implementation of the geological (geomimetic) positions in construction materials science are given in the work. The wall materials obtained with this technology have a much more developed surface than traditional wall materials. The second example of using such approaches is the development of internal care systems that will create a more highly organized structure of cement stone at the macro-, micro- and nano-scale levels and concrete in general at all stages: the stage of mixing, hardening and exploitation of the material. The regularities of the structure formation processes are revealed and the principles for increasing the efficiency of non-autoclaved aerated concrete due to application of composite binders, process control in a three-phase disperse porous system and the development of technological methods for the production of protective (fortification) structures are developed.",2017
The application of reliability analysis in engineering practice - reinforced concrete foundation,reinforced concrete foundation; reliability index; FORM; SORM; Monte Carlo simulation,,"In recent years, the importance of assessment of structural reliability has increased significantly. This is confirmed by the recommendations of the standard PN-EN 1990 in which the rules and requirements to ensure safety, serviceability and durability of the structure are specified. It also sets out the basis for calculation and verification of constructions and provides guidance to ensure their reliability. Reliability design focuses on the ability to meet specific design requirements, taking into account the planned period of use. The concept of the planned period of use should be considered as the adopted in the project interval in which the structure or a part of the structure is to be used for its intended purpose without the need for general repairs. Typically, reliability is expressed in probabilistic metrics - using an index of reliability or probability of failure. Reliability of building structures depends on a number of correlated factors, mainly on the quality of materials, building precision and level of control, protection against environmental influences and maintenance level during exploitation, specific period of use, adopted solutions for the construction materials, design details and technologies, adopted loads (both their values and combinations), standard requirements regarding capacity, exploitation and durability, quality of computational models used in the design process and methods for assessing reliability of the structure. The performed reliability analysis concerns a reinforced concrete foundation, for which reliability index and probability of failure has been specified using the following methods: analytical method FORM, simulation methods FORM and SORM as well as Monte Carlo simulation.

Investigation of Hydraulic Binding Characteristics of Lime Based Mortars Used in Historical Masonry Structures,,CARBONATION,"In the historic masonry structures, hard and large rock fragments were used as the construction materials. The hydraulic binder material prepared to keep this used material in its entirety is a different material than the cement used today. Khorasan mortar made by using aggregate and lime exhibits a more flexible structure than the concrete. This feature allows the historic building to be more durable. There is also a significant industrial value because of the use of Khorasan mortar in the restoration of historic masonry structures. Therefore, the calculation of the ideal mixture of Khorasan mortar and the determination of its mechanical and physical properties are of great importance regarding preserving historic buildings. In this study, the mixtures of different lime and brick fractions were prepared. It was determined that Khorasan mortar shows the highest compressive strength in mixtures with water/lime ratio of 0.55 and lime/aggregate ratio of 0.66. By keeping the mixing ratio constant, it was observed that the strengths of the samples kept in the humidity chamber for different curing times increased day by day. The early strength values of samples with the high lime/aggregate ratio (l/a: 0.83) were higher than those with the low lime/aggregate ratio (l/a: 0.5). For the samples with low lime/aggregate ratio, there was an increase in the strength values depending on the curing period. As the cure duration increases, a chemical reaction takes place between the lime and the brick fracture, and as a result of this reaction, the strength values are increased.",2017
Investigating the Influence of Waste Basalt Powder on Selected Properties of Cement Paste and Mortar,,CONSTRUCTION SECTOR; CONCRETE; DUST; LIMESTONE; FILLERS,"Concrete is the most widely used man-made construction material in civil engineering applications. The consumption of cement and thus concrete, increases day by day along with the growth of urbanization and industrialization and due to new developments in construction technologies, population growing, increasing of living standard. Concrete production consumes much energy and large amounts of natural resources. It causes environmental, energy and economic losses. The most important material in concrete production is cement. Cement industry contributes to production of about 7% of all CO2 generated in the world. Every ton of cement production releases nearly one ton of CO2 to atmosphere. Thus the concrete and cement industry changes the environment appearance and influences it very much. Therefore, it has become very important for construction industry to focus on minimizing the environmental impact, reducing energy consumption and limiting CO2 emission. The need to meet these challenges has spurred an interest in the development of a blended Portland cement in which the amount of clinker is reduced and partially replaced with mineral additives - supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). Many researchers have studied the possibility of using another mineral powder in mortar and concrete production. The addition of marble dust, basalt powder, granite or limestone powder positively affects some properties of cement mortar and concrete. This paper presents an experimental study on the properties of cement paste and mortar containing basalt powder. The basalt powder is a waste emerged from the preparation of aggregate used in asphalt mixture production. Previous studies have shown that analysed waste used as a fine aggregate replacement, has a beneficial effect on some properties of mortar and concrete, i.e. compressive strength, flexural strength and freeze resistance also. The present study shows the results of the research concerning the modification of cement paste and mortar with basalt powder. The modification consists in that the powder waste was added as partial replacement of cement. Four types of common cement were examined, i. e. CEM I, CEM II/A-S, CEM II/A-V and CEM II/B-V. The percentages of basalt powder in this research are 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% by mass. Results showed that the addition of basalt powder improved the strength of cement mortar. The use of mineral powder as the partial substitution of cement allows the effective management of industrial waste and improves some properties of cement mortar.",2017
The Effect of Mineral Powders Derived from Industrial Wastes on Selected Mechanical Properties of Concrete,,,"In recent years, concrete has been the most popular construction material. The main component of the concrete is cement. However, its production and transport causes significant emissions of CO2. Reports in the literature show that many laboratories are attempting to modify the composition of the concrete using various additives. These attempts are primarily designed to eliminate parts of cement. The greater part of the cement will be replaced with the selected additive, the more significant is the economic and ecological effect. Most attempts are related to the replacement of the selected additive in an amount of from 10 to 30% by weight of cement. Mineral powders, which are waste material producing crushed aggregate, are increasingly used for this purpose. Management of the waste carries significant cost related to their storage and disposal. With this in mind, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of mineral powders derived from industrial wastes on selected mechanical properties of concrete. In particular, the aim was to determine the effect of quartz and quartz-feldspar powders. For this purpose, 40, 50, 60% by weight of the cement was replaced by the selected powders. The results obtained were analysed and compared with previous attempts to replace the selected additive in an amount of from 10 to 30% by weight of cement.",2017
Review on the Traditional Uses and Potential of Totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) as Construction Material,,,"The recent advances in the wood construction field have demonstrated the feasibility and advantages of using wood-based materials in tall buildings structures and other constructive uses, which could lead to a net reduction in CO(2)eq emissions of the construction sector by replacing high-energy consuming materials like concrete or steel, with wood and biomass-based materials. Among these biomass-based materials are the Non-Timber Forest Products (NTFP) which are plantsthat canprovide important contributionsto the construction sector and help to reduce the net CO(2)eq emissions of the building industry. One of these plants is the totora (Schoenoplectus Californicus) that has been long used by several communities for making handicrafts and as construction material. Recent studies on this plant have analyzed its properties and its feasibility to be used for producing materials of interest to the contemporary building industry. The totora is a bulrush that grows in lakes and marshes in America from California to Chile and some of the Pacific islands. It grows from the sea level to 4500maasl, it can grow in fresh water and estuaries, and it is resistant to water level changes and drought. This bulrush has been used by many cultures as medicine, food, forage, material for building houses, boats and different handicrafts. The most important examples of the use of totora in the world are the floating islands of the Uros in Lake Titicaca. The Uros people have developed traditional techniques for building their homes, boats, and even the artificial islands where they live on with methods based almost exclusively on the totora. This way of living and production system has been maintained for more than 500 years. This review is about the main constructive techniques that have been used for traditional construction in totora and some of therecent researches that have been made on this subject. Experiments in architecture and industrial design objects made with totora have shown its versatility, durability and high aesthetic value which is exploited in object design and architectural finishes. Additionally, recent studies on the insulating capacity of totora samples have determined an average conductivity of 0,06W/mK, which is comparable to some of the common insulating materials in the current market. The review of the historical uses and recent studies on this material indicate its potential in the contemporary construction field along with other environmental benefits. One of the key features is the totora productivity that can be as much as 56 tons of dry matter per hectare per year, which is near 5 times the average production of a conifer plantation. Therefore, to foster the research about its feasible applications in the contemporary construction field could lead to the reduction of the pressure on wood forests and plantations by developing a new material source for the construction industry.",2017
Potential of Progressive Construction Systems in Slovakia,,,"Construction industry is a sector with rapid development. Progressive technologies of construction and new construction materials also called modern methods of construction (MMC) are developed constantly. MMC represent the adoption of construction industrialisation and the use of prefabrication of components in building construction. One of these modern methods is also system Varianthaus, which is based on, insulated concrete forms principle and provides complete production plant for wall, ceiling and roof elements for a high thermal insulation house construction. Another progressive construction system is EcoB, which represents an insulated precast concrete panel based on combination of two layers, insulation and concrete, produced in a factory as a whole. Both modern methods of construction are not yet known and wide-spread in the Slovak construction market. The aim of this paper is focused on demonstration of MMC using potential in Slovakia. MMC potential is proved based on comparison of the selected parameters of construction process - construction costs and construction time. The subject of this study is family house modelled in three material variants - masonry construction (as a representative of traditional methods of construction), Varianthaus and EcoB (as the representatives of modern methods of construction). The results of this study provide the useful information in decision-making process for potential investors of construction.",2017
Determining the Environmental Benefits of Ultra High Performance Concrete as a Bridge Construction Material,,,"Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) is a material that is attracting attention in the construction industry due to the high mechanical strength and durability, leading to structures having low maintenance requirements. The production of UHPC, however, has generally higher environmental impact than normal strength concrete due to the increased demand of cement required in the concrete mix. What is still not sufficiently investigated, is if the longer lifetime, slimmer construction and lower maintenance requirements lead to a net environmental benefit compared to standard concrete bridge design. This study utilizes life cycle assessment (LCA) to determine the lifetime impacts of two comparable highway crossing footbridges spanning 40 meters, designed respectively with UHPC and normal strength concrete. The results of the study show that UHPC is an effective material for reducing lifetime emissions from construction and maintenance of long lasting infrastructure, as the UHPC design outperforms the normal strength concrete bridge in most impact categories.",2017
Wavelet Analysis of Acoustic Emissions during Tensile Test of Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer Composites,,CONCRETE BEAMS; BEHAVIOR,"The increase of the interest in polymer composites in technology and in people's everyday lives has been noticed in the recent years. Producing new materials with polymer matrix of particular properties that cannot be achieved by traditional construction materials contributed to high interest in fibre composite materials. However, a wider use of these materials is limited because of the lack of detailed knowledge about their properties and behaviour in various conditions of exposure under load. Mechanical degradation of polymer composites, which is caused by prolonged permanent loads, is connected with the changes of the material structure that are local or that include the whole volume of the element's body. These changes are in the form of various types of discontinuity, including: deboning, matrix and fibers cracks and delamination. The article presents the example of the application of acoustic emission method based on the analysis of the waves through the use of wavelet analysis for the evaluation of the progress of the destructive processes and the level of the degradation of composite tapes that were subject to tensile testing.",2017
Timber - Material of the Future - Examples of Small Wooden Architectural Structures,,,"The aim of this article is to present various types of wood-based products, classified as engineered timber, while specifying the implications of their structural properties for their forms. Timber is used as a construction material due to its fire resistance, good structural characteristics and insulating properties. The advent of new technologies of wood processing and wood-based materials production has converted timber into a high-tech material, thus encouraging the architects to consider it ever more often in their projects. As wooden technologies overcome constraints, timber begins to compete with steel and concrete. The design characteristics of new wood-based products allow wooden structures to be higher, have larger spans, and more diverse forms than ever. Wood-based materials include materials made of solid wood, veneers, strand, and wood which, due to its inferior quality, would otherwise be unfit for constructions. Elements and layers of these products are glued using different kinds of strong and water-resistant adhesives. The article presents the history of development of new wood technologies, discussing increasingly popular wood-based materials such as glued laminated timber, cross-laminated timber, or structural composite lumber. The paper analyses their technical and fire-resistance properties, and points to ecological aspect, as factors contributing to the growing popularity of these materials. Finally, the timber's characteristics are contrasted with those of steel and concrete. The article lists examples of wooden objects representing the so-called small architecture structures from across Europe. They illustrate the potential, the uniqueness and the versatility that wood-based materials offer for constructors and architects. All these features form sufficient grounds for stating that timber truly is a construction material of the 21st century.",2017
A framework for assessing the environmental benefits of mass timber construction,Mass timber construction; sustainable materials; renewable materials; environmental benefit,ENERGY; CARBON; WOOD,"The construction industry represents one of the most significant contributors to human-induced environmental damage. Many of the negative consequences on the environment result from the extraction, processing and manufacture of construction materials and components. This includes the depletion of raw material, energy and water resources; loss of habitats; contamination of water and soil; reduced air quality; and climate change. The production of some of the most common construction materials, such as concrete, steel, glass and aluminum are of most critical concern. There is a growing awareness of the need for a greater use of renewable materials that not only reduce resource depletion, but also address the range of other environmental issues. Cellulose-based materials, such as timber and straw are a commonly used renewable alternative. While timber has been used in construction for many centuries, there has been a recent resurgence in the use of timber as a replacement for traditional concrete and steel structures, particularly in response to these pressing environmental imperatives. Mass timber construction (MTC) is seen as a potentially viable alternative for dealing with these issues while at the same time meeting the demands of modern buildings, such as increasing height, speed of construction and fire resistance. Most existing research on MTC has been centered on its structural performance and fire resistance. There is a general lack of understanding of how this form of construction performs from an environmental perspective, which is critical given this is considered as one of its main strengths. This study establishes a framework for assessing the environmental benefits of MTC. The aim is to provide a streamlined approach to enable key building project stakeholders to assess the potential for MTC to provide environmental benefits over traditional construction methods in a particular building project. This can provide useful guidance for decision-making in relation to the use of MTC. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2017
STIFFNESS MODULUS AND CREEP PROPERTIES OF THE COCONUT SHELL IN AN ASPHALT MIXTURE,asphalt mixture; coconut shell; creep modulus; stiffness modulus; properties,CONCRETE; REPLACEMENT; AGGREGATE; WASTE,"Coconut shell (CS) is an agricultural waste engineered into a road construction material. This study was conducted to evaluate the stiffness modulus and dynamic creep properties of the asphaltic concrete containing CS as an aggregate replacement. A mixture design incorporating the bitumen penetration grade 60/70 was used to produce specimens for testing. Four CS replacements namely 0%, 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% by weight volumes were used. The asphaltic concrete performances were characterized by stiffness modulus, dynamic creep and the correlation between the strain and the loading time. Test results revealed that using CSs as aggregate replacements in the asphaltic concrete help increase the resilient modulus and creep stiffness at approximately 15%. Therefore, the incorporation of CS exhibits considerable potential as road construction material.",2017
Composite Materials Based on Cement Binders Modified with SiO2 Nanoadditives,hydrothermal solution; modifiers; nanosilica; equal distribution; durability,,"Development of nanotechnologies allows to solve a number of problems of construction materials science: increase in strength, durability, abrasion and corrosion resistance that determines operational reliability of building constructions. Generally it is achieved due to nanoparticles that modify the structure and properties of the existing materials or products and are entered into their volume or on a surface layer. It's theoretically and experimentally proved that the modified water has the bigger activity owing to the change of the ionic composition influencing the.. size and other parameters. As nanoparticles have a high level of surface energy, they show the increased tendency to agglomeration, meanwhile the size of agglomerates can reach several micrometers. In this regard an urgent task is to equally distribute and disaggregate the nanoparticles in the volume of tempering water. The experiments on studying of influence of the nanoparticles of silica distributed in volume of liquid by means of ultrasonic processing on characteristics of cement and sand solution and heavy concrete have been conducted. Nanoadditive influence on density, speed of strength development, final strength under compression of materials on the basis of cement depending on nanoadditive mass percent has been established.",2017
A Review of Nanoclay Applications in the Pervious Concrete Pavement,,CEMENT-BASED MATERIALS; OF-THE-ART; PORTLAND-CEMENT; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ENGINEERING PROPERTIES; CLAY; MONTMORILLONITE; NANOTECHNOLOGY; NANOCOMPOSITES; MORTARS,"In recent years, the use of nanoclay has received various interests in order to enhance the properties of construction materials which can also be eligible for pavement technology and engineering application. This review paper summarizes the effect of nanoclay as cement replacement and additive to the performance of pervious concrete pavement. The addition of nanoclay to pervious concrete has demonstrated improvements in strength properties such as compressive and flexural strength, durability such as freeze-thaw and chloride penetration resistance, shrinkage, and denser microstructure but at the same time reduced the porosity, permeability and water absorption properties. This enhancement is due to the roles of nanoclay as nanoreinforcements, nanofillers, nucleation site, and reactive pozzolans in order to promote hydration and improve material properties.",2017
Securing fire safety for underground structures,organic construction materials; fire-technical properties; dangerous factors of fire,,"For science-based introduction of the effective organic construction materials (OCM) in underground constructions, two principles of normalization of their application are offered. One of them, so called logical is based on comparison of fire - technical properties (FTP) - combustibility, inflammability, heat release, propagation flame over surface, smoke ability, toxicity of fire gasses of the newly developed material with the same properties widely used in practice of underground construction materials. The second principle which can be called estimated - analytical, is that having a construction with concrete mining-technical characteristics and operation conditions and based on certain theoretical prerequisites, the dangerous factors of fire (DFF) quantitatively are defined as in fire growth zone, as well as beyond this zone. Before carrying out normalization of OCM application by these principles, it is offered to make an assessment of materials on their main operational properties - durability, deformability, thermo-physical characteristics, air permeability, depending on a purpose of OCM. The work provides OCM requirements by these properties. It is shown that the logical principle of normalization though toughens the requirement to the materials on fire safety, but doesn't promote forbidding of the most effective material. The estimated-analytical principle of fire safety assessment of the constructions brings to definition of computational probability of DFF influence on a person per year. The last is considered as a function of fire probabilities, evacuation of people, and an effective work of technical solutions for fire-prevention protection. In this work, the issue of recording the main DFF influencing on survival of a human and their limit values is discussed. The increase of fires around the world, apparently, should be explained with the growing volume of capital construction and large-scale utilization of the constructive, insulating, protective - insulating and technological new effective organic construction materials (OCM) with low resistance against fire in different units of the developed countries. The intention is occurred to limit utilization of these materials not taking into account the technical-economical effectiveness obtained by their introduction, and that a level of fire safety is defined not only by fire-technical properties (FTP) of the materials, but also by the means of its active protection. Fire safety of underground structures means such a condition, where regulating probability excludes fire origin and propagation, influence of dangerous factors of fire (DFF) on humans, and provides protection of material values.",2017
Study of the Visco-Elastic Parameters of Asphalt Concrete,Asphalt concrete; phase angle; dissipated energy,,"The asphalt mixture as the basic construction material in roads is described with specific deformation parameters. These are negatively influenced by temperature, and this is one of the problems which cause short pavement lifespan. Increasing temperature affects the behavior of bitumen-bonded materials from elastic to viscous state. Observation of this problem was made in this study by measuring the phase angle during dynamic bending tests. Temperature dependence of the phase angle was observed for three different temperatures and five chosen frequencies. Another aim of the study was to observe the relationship of the phase angle to the fatigue lifespan for one specific temperature and frequency. The evaluation was done using the classical AASHTO method as well as the chosen dissipated energy ratio method. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2017
Application of Corrosion Potential as a Tool to Assess Sustainability of Indigenous Concrete Mixes in Bangladesh,,REINFORCED-CONCRETE; STEEL; BARS,"The tradeoff between strength and durability of concrete has often been misleading in the prevalent construction practices in Bangladesh. Accompanied by high saline conditions, infrastructures around the coastal areas are subjected to durability issues. Mitigation of this problem necessitates use of typical resistive materials, which is economically infeasible for medium to small-scale projects. Hence, an extensive quantitative analysis to assess impact of salinity on corrosion of RC structures, made of local construction materials has been carried out using accelerated corrosion technique. The parameters investigated were effects of aggregate types, mix proportions, and water-cement ratios. Assessment of corrosion potential over time revealed that particular mixes ubiquitously used in Bangladesh resulted in higher corrosion of embedded reinforcement. Moreover, a correlation between reinforcement weight loss and corrosion potential was obtained. This quantitative measure of degree of corrosion can be used for in-situ assessment of RC structures and will eventually assist in taking appropriate measures to ensure longterm sustainability.",2017
Sustainable Pre-Stressed Concrete from Seawater,,GREAT-BARRIER-REEF; CORAL-REEFS; OCEAN ACIDIFICATION; ARTIFICIAL REEFS; DIVING TOURISM; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; CARBON; TRANSPLANTATION; ZOOXANTHELLAE,"A process for electrolytic deposition of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from seawater was pioneered by Wolf Hilbertz in the late 1970s, whose original idea was to make sustainable building materials from seawater. The process was inspired by and is derived from cathodic protection systems used on offshore oil and gas platforms. While the basic science is well understood, most applications have been for artificial reefs. It appears that there has been no systematic attempt anywhere in the world to develop a commercial system for sustainable building materials. This is one of the only technological prospects for sustainable building materials production which is in effect infinitely scalable: the possibilities are limited only by our imaginations. The design concept is replicable and scalable in tropical waters throughout the world. It is one of the only viable approaches to making sustainable building materials at scale which also yields multiple marine biodiversity and climate change adaptation benefits. Based on current market prices for limestone and limestone based construction materials, commercial production appears to be viable at the higher price range. It is time to revive Hilbertz's original idea and make it work.",2017

Performance evaluation of Burnt Clay-Fly Ash Unburnt Bricks and precast paver blocks,Clay brick; Fly ash; Unburnt brick; Water absorption; Efflorescence,,"Brick is one of major construction material and is widely used in construction. Cost of clay brick is considerably increased due to its higher demand, transportation, unavailability of raw materials and environmental restrictions. Moreover, fly ash based un-burnt bricks are commonly used because of its availability as well as superior performance. In the recent years, lot of clay and fly ash brick production units has been started due to their demand. At the same time, quality controls of in-situ bricks which are directly supplied to the construction are not adequately controlled. Brick quality is significantly influenced by its raw materials such as clay and fly ash. Moreover, characteristics of fly ash and clay vary to a greater extent in different regions in India. A comprehensive evaluation of quality of in-situ bricks from different units is not available in the existing literature. In the study, clay bricks and unburnt fly ash bricks were collected from different production units and their characteristics were evaluated. Moreover concrete paver blocks were collected from seven different manufacturers and quality of paver specimens were assessed. Results from the study showed that considerable variations in fly ash bricks compared to standards specifications. However similar characteristics were observed for clay bricks. High strength was observed for precast paver concrete specimens than minimum requirement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
Physiochemical and engineering characteristics of cenosphere and its application as a lightweight construction material- A review,Cenosphere; lighweight; physiochemical characteristics; construction material,ASH CENOSPHERE; COMPOSITES; CONCRETE; CEMENT; FOAMS,"Cenospheres are exclusively free flowing powders comprised of hard shelled, hollow, tiny spheres collected from coal ash. Their amount is based on the calcium and iron content present in the coal ash. The apparent density of these cenospheres is less than that of water and as such, they float on the ash slurry when it is impounded in the ash ponds or lagoons. Cenosphere are the inorganic part of coal containing amorphous structure and spherical shape. This is containing SiO2 and Al2O3 in higher amount. Cenospheres are being used in different industrial applications, mainly due to their low density, high strength, and good thermal properties. They have found a major application as fillers in syntactic foams and ceramic foams, fire, heat and sound insulation materials, manufacturing of sports equipment, anti-corrosive paints and construction works. Cenospheres are excellent potential raw material for the manufacture of construction material like light weight building block and concrete. They yield many benefits such low density, excellent mechanical strength and reasonable cost when used as a light weight aggregate or as an additive in concrete production. They can even be used to produce light-weight cement and paints with modifications in the surface and chemical properties. As such an effort is made in this paper to focus on the physiochemical and engineering characteristics of cenosphere. This paper also focused on various valuable application of cenosphere in construction industry. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
Influence of superplasticizer on the properties of geopolymer concrete using industrial wastes,Geo-polymer; super-plasticiser; GGBS; Flyash; Glass powder,,"Normally Geo-Polymer concrete (GPC) is developed using source materials like Fly Ash, and alkaline activator sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solution, cured at elevated temperature. An attempt was made to make GPC using a suitable mix of industrial waste materials like Fly ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), glass powder, and aggregates. In the present work, waste glass powder in the form of reactive silica is used instead of sodium silicate solution for the production of conventional GPC. Required quantity of sodium hydroxide solution having 8 M has been used. It has been observed that 15% replacement of fly ash by glass powder gives maximum 28 day strength and it is taken as an optimum dosage for the production of mix proportion for GPC using GGBS. The experimental results indicated that replacement of fly ash by various percentages of the GGBS resulted in increase of the compressive strength, split tensile strength of the fly ash based GPC up to 15% and thereafter there is a decrease in the strength values. It has also been observed that use of naphthalene- based super plasticizer improves the fresh and hardened behavior of GPC. Thus, the results of strength tests on GPC cubes prepared and cured at room temperature only indicate the development of compressive strength up to M40 can be achieved corresponding to the selected optimum replacement of fly ash by GGBS and glass powder. Hence the use of major industrial wastes such as fly ash, glass powder and GGBS is found to be feasible in the production of new sustainable green construction material of reasonably good strength.

Application of Bacteria in Concrete,Concrete; Bacteria; Compressive strength; UPV; Rebound Hammer,PRECIPITATION,"Concrete is one of the most commonly used construction material suffers from micro cracks that cut down the load carrying capacity resulting in shortening of self-life. Now a day, biologically modifications of construction materials become more popular for strength improvement and long-term sustainability. An investigation has been conducted to study the compressive strength of concrete by using two different bacteria named Bacillus Cereus and Bacillus Subtilis with three different concentration (viz. 103, 105, 107 cells/ml) of each bacterium. It has been found that there was an increase in compressive strength at both 7 days and 28 days. It was noticed that the optimum concentration was different for different bacteria. The optimum concentration of Bacillus Subtilis and Bacillus Cereus were found as 105 cells/ml and 103 cells/ml respectively. Moreover, more compressive strength was obtained by addition of Bacillus Subtilis at optimum concentration compared to the samples made with all three concentrations of Bacillus Cereus both at 7 and 28 days.

Structural Aspects of Cold-Formed Steel Section Designed as U-Shape Composite Beam,,CONNECTIONS,"Composite beam construction usually associated with old-style Hot-Rolled Steel Section (HRSS) has proven to act much better in compare with Cold-Formed Steel Section (CFSS) sections due to thicker section. Due, it's getting popular to replace HRSS with CFSS in some aspects as a composite beam. The advantages such as lightweight, cost effective and easy to install have contributed to the apply CFSS as a preferred construction material for composite beam. There is a few technical data available regarding the application of the usage of CFSS as a composite system, despite the potentials use for residential and light-weight industrial constructions. This paper presents an experimental tests results which have been conducted using CFSS as composite beam. Composite action of CFSS arranged as double beam with Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC) slab are integrated together with bolted shear connectors were used. A full-scale test comprised of 3 proposed composite beam specimens with bolted shear connector spaced at 300 mm interval of grade 8.8 was using single nut with washer on flange of CFS, cast to the slab and loaded until failed. The test show that the bolted shear connector yielded better capacity of ultimate strength and ultimate moment for the proposed composite beam.

Mechanical and thermal evaluation of different types of PCM-concrete composite panels,Phase change materials; PCM-concrete; thermal conductivity; thermal diffusivity; thermal storage capacity,PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; ENERGY STORAGE; MICROENCAPSULATED-PCM; BUILDING WALLS; HEAT-STORAGE; CAPACITY,"The thermal mass of construction materials can be used to reduce the energy required for heating and cooling buildings. The heat storage capacity of concrete can be increased by incorporating phase change materials (PCMs) and hence providing a latent heat storage capacity. However, the addition of PCMs to concrete can reduce its conductivity due to the low conductivity of the PCMs. This hinders the efficient utilisation of the additional heat storage capacity provided by the PCM. Two types of PCM-concrete composite panels were manufactured. Firstly, a panel was formed by adding microencapsulated paraffin to fresh concrete during the mixing process. Secondly, butyl stearate was vacuum impregnated into lightweight aggregate which was then included in the concrete mix. In order to counteract the reduction in conductivity caused by the PCM, a second group of PCM-concrete composite panels were made using ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) as a partial cement replacement. The use of GGBS results in a denser cement paste which, for a given aggregate type, increases the conductivity of the concrete. This study aimed to establish which type of PCM-concrete composite material was most effective at improving the thermal mass behaviour of the panel and also to evaluate the effect that the PCM had on the relevant properties of concrete. The effect of GGBS on the thermal performance of the panels is reported.",2017
Reflection and transmission properties of common construction materials at 2.4 GHz frequency,electromagnetic fields; microwaves; shielding; transmission; reflection; absorption; building materials,ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; CONCRETE; WORKERS,"Having an adequate shielding from radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) may serve many causes: to protect sensitive electronic equipment from outside interference; to protect the environment from the high radiation generating equipment; to protect humans from excess radiation etc. Strong RF EMFs may be encountered in public domain but especially in occupational settings, where the process and technology of work requires the usage of RF EMFs. Technical measures to reduce the levels of EMFs include using construction materials with attenuation properties. Generally three types of microwave behavior can be observed: transmission, reflection and absorption. In this study the radiofrequency reflection and transmission characteristics of common building materials were investigated. The investigated materials can broadly be divided into three groups: 1) load bearing materials - concrete, aerated concrete, LECA concrete; 2) thermal insulation materials - foamed polystyrene, mineral wool; 3) cover materials - gypsum based plates and wood dust/chips boards. The samples were square shaped, with the size of 300 x 300 mm. The testing frequency was 2.4 GHz and the output power of the generator was 0 dBm. The study used three standard gain horn antennas for reflection and transmission measurements. The results show relatively good transmission properties for most of the materials. The least transmittance was measured in high performance concrete plate where only 34 % of the waves penetrated the material and 35 % were reflected off Also with low transmission properties are gypsum board and oriented strand board. These materials were also measured to give low reflectance, 17 % by both. Besides concrete, waterproof plywood and particleboard with veneer gave off somewhat reflections. Other materials exhibited very small reflection properties. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2017

Nanotechnology is one of the most active research areas that encompass a number of disciplines including civil engineering and construction materials. In today's life, though utilization of cement based materials plays a vital role in the infrastructure development, it is polluting the environment by emitting CO (2). Based on this view, researchers have been pursuing to evolve new or alternate material towards a green and sustainable solution. It is observed that the better understanding and engineering of complex structure of cement-based material at nano-level will definitely result in a new generation of construction materials with enhanced properties, viz., strength and durability. Currently, the most active research areas dealing with cement and concrete are: understanding of the hydration of cement particles and the use of nano-size ingredients. Concrete science is a multidisciplinary area of research where nanotechnology potentially offers the opportunity to enhance the understanding of concrete behavior, to engineer its properties and to lower production and ecological cost of construction materials.

Experimental study of signal behavior for wireless communication in construction,Innovation; Signal attenuation; Signal strength; Signals' behaviour on construction site; Wi-Fi network on construction site; Wireless signals,TECHNOLOGIES; PERSPECTIVE,"Purpose - The purpose of this study is to understand the effects of building components of a growing concrete structure and different building materials such as glass and steel on Wi-Fi signals propagation in a construction site. Wireless local area networks are considered effective tools to link the islands-of-communication in construction. Still, designing a Wi-Fi network that can grow with a new construction requires that one understands the performance of propagation of electromagnetic signals transmitted at 2.4 GHz. Design/methodology/approach - This paper reviews the theoretical behavior of electromagnetic signals when signal attenuation is caused by various construction materials changing their strengths, directions and possibly leading to total absorption. The authors used a typical building layout to conduct experimental work to measure the effect of common building features and communication technologies on signal strengths. Findings - The measured data not only confirmed the theory-based predictions but also demonstrated the complexity of predicting signal propagation when obstructions inhibit the line-of-sight ""travel"" of electromagnetic signals. Originality/value - Different to other papers, the experiments were conducted outside a concrete building mimicking the situation where the transmitter is set up at the site office.",2017

BACK ANALYSIS FOR DETERMINATION OF TENSION-SOFTENING DIAGRAM,Back analysis; Damage; Traction-separation diagram; Wood; Concrete,COMPOSITE,"Concrete and other cementitious materials are undoubtedly the most important and widely used construction material nowadays. However, there exist other building materials, such as wood or composites, which are on high demand as well. Different mathematical models describing the complex material behaviour of these mostly quasi-brittle materials are used. Their application often requires the knowledge of experimentally determined fracture properties of studied material. The total fracture energy can be often determined directly from experimental measurements as the total work divided by the ligament area. However, the determination of true tensile strength and the traction-separation diagram is usually problematic. The primary objective of this paper is to present a numerical scheme, that can be used to determine the traction-separation diagram in the framework of sequentially linear analysis (SLA).",2017
Investigation on Wall Panel Sandwiched With Lightweight Concrete,EPS beads; Lightweight concrete; material nonlinearity; Sandwich panel,,"The rapid population growth and urbanization have made a massive demand for the shelter and construction materials. Masonry walls are the major component in the housing sector and it has brittle characteristics and exhibit poor performance against the uncertain loads. Further, the structure requires heavier sections for carrying the dead weight of masonry walls. The present investigations are carried out to develop a simple, lightweight and cost effective technology for replacing the existing wall systems. The lightweight concrete is developed for the construction of sandwich wall panel. The EPS (Expanded Polystyrene) beads of 3 mm diameter size are mixed with concrete and developed a lightweight concrete with a density 9 kN/m(3). The lightweight sandwich panel is cast with a lightweight concrete inner core and ferrocement outer skins. This lightweight wall panel is tested for in-plane compression loading. A nonlinear finite element analysis with damaged plasticity model is carried out with both material and geometrical nonlinearities. The experimental and analytical results were compared.

Numerical simulation research on the fracture behavior of basalt fiber reinforced reactive powder concrete,Basalt Fiber; Reactive Powder Concrete; Numerical Simulation; Fracture Energy; Smeared Crack Model,,"Basalt fiber reinforced reactive powder concrete, as a new type of construction material, has a lot of outstanding performances. For example: high strength, good flexibility, good wear-resisting and impact resistance, it also shows good property in corrosion resistance. However, the study on basalt fiber reinforced reactive powder concrete is still in the initial stage, the numerical simulation research on the fracture property is basically in the blank stage. In this paper, the smeared cracking model was used in the numerical simulation. Cube compressive strength test, prism axial compression test, cylinder splitting tensile test and three-point bending beam fracture tests were done to get the relative parameters. The parameters obtained from the tests were used to develop the smeared cracking model by using the finite element analysis software ABAQUS.

Investigating the foundation of the Amphitheatrum Flavium through the Passage of Commodus,,PENETRATING RADAR DATA; TOMOGRAPHY; SITE; WALL,"In this work we present a non-invasive investigation of the Amphitheatrum Flavium, executed using the ground penetrating radar (GPR) technique, with the aim to improve the knowledge of the construction materials and techniques employed for building foundation. Therefore, the mail goal of this work is to achieve quantitative and reliable information for assessing the seismic vulnerability of the structure. The GPR survey was performed through the Passage of Commodus, excavated within the foundation for a length of about 60 m. GPR data were acquired on the floor and on the lateral walls, using different antenna frequencies (80, 200, 600, 900 MHz) as they combine good resolution and depth of investigation. On the floor dataset, we detected three equally-spaced anomalies related to old utilities parallel to the passageway, whose roof is located at a depth of 1 m. In addition to this, the GPR radargrams clearly highlight horizontal layers within the foundation, related to the sequential development of works at the time of construction. GPR dataset acquired on the wall allowed us to detect the thickness of the concrete covering the foundation and to locate the extensions of the structural elements underground. Outside the foundation, the passage is built using bricks, with external walls about 1 m thick. Therefore, GPR dataset revealed that the foundation of the Colosseum is a heterogeneous multi-layer element, with the presence of cavity networks and buried elements related to the plinths of the load-bearing structures. This work confirmed that foundation was built over time by means of subdivisions into small sectors, probably both in the horizontal and vertical directions.",2017

In these contexts, concretes are the most widely adopted construction materials to build supporting civil structural systems. However, massive productions of concretes significantly consume global energy resources and induce negative impacts to ecology which should be paid with serious attentions. Modern concrete productions are strived for not only producing highly performing materials but also being continuously more ecological and energy efficient. The uses of chemicals as additives and admixtures are recognized to be relatively more obvious approaches to answer the needs of modern concrete production for more energy efficiencies and carbon footprint reductions. Chemical additives are added to the cement and it is usually during the comminution stage. Chemical admixtures are intermixed together with other concrete constituents. In the current situation, the momentum of increasing concrete consumption contributes the energy requirement and creates negative ecological impacts massively spreading all over the world. The present study aims to identify the transformations and outlooks in additive and admixture chemical technologies used for modern and future concrete productions. The perspective discussed in this study can assist to formulate research needs for future developments of additive and admixture chemicals. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2017
Comparison of Responses of Concrete Damage Material Models with Respect to Optimization-Based Material Parameter Identification,,TOWER,"Today, the inverse identification or optimization of material model parameters is very often used to find input parameter values for use in relevant nonlinear material models. These parameter values should enable the responses of structures obtained from numerical simulations to very closely approximate the real responses of such structures obtained from experiments. Due to the popularity of concrete as a construction material, much attention is paid to nonlinear material models that aim to describe its behavior. This paper is focused on the optimization- based inverse identification of the parameters of two related nonlinear concrete material models which are known as the Karagozian & Case Concrete model and the Karagozian & Case Concrete model - Release III. Within this paper, the identification of the material model parameters is performed on the basis of interaction between nonlinear numerical simulations, optimization algorithms and experimental data, the latter of which take the form of a loading curve measured during a triaxial compression test. A comparison of the responses of both of the used material models when the optimized parameters are employed is, of course, part of this paper.",2017
Embodied CO2 Emissions in Building Construction Materials of Hellenic Dwellings,Lifecycle inventory; embodied CO2; building construction materials,,"As current research moves towards zero energy buildings, it is important to minimize the total energy consumption and environmental impact of a building during its lifecycle. Total energy consists of the operational energy and the embodied energy, which is related to the embodied CO2(ECO2) emissions that contribute to the greenhouse phenomenon. This paper identifies the basic construction materials of four typical Hellenic dwellings and estimates their environmental impact in terms of ECO2. To this end, a material analysis is required. ECO2 is estimated by multiplying material masses with the corresponding ECO2 coefficients (kgCO(2)/kg). Due to lack of a comprehensive Hellenic database, data from an international database are utilized. The results provide practical baseline indicators for the contribution of each material in terms of mass and ECO2. Concrete is the dominant material in terms of mass, while steel dominates in terms of ECO2. In one case, the materials of the major electromechanical installations are also considered; their contribution in terms of ECO2 is low compared to that of the construction materials. Finally, CO2 payback time related to the replacement of building openings in order to upgrade its energy performance is demonstrated in one of the cases. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Initially, the physical properties of the aggregates made of demolished and crushed concrete, cement blocks and ceramic tiles were tested and the results obtained were compared with the properties of natural aggregates. Secondly, their optimum mix proportions were obtained by conducting a series of tests on the concrete and mortar samples that were produced by partially replacing the natural aggregates in them with demolished aggregates in the proportions of 30%, 60% and 100% and the results obtained were compared with the results of similar tests carried out on control samples made using only natural aggregates. The results revealed that the physical properties of processed demolished construction materials are almost similar to those of natural aggregates and that the results correlated well with the previous research findings. The results related to the engineering properties indicated that demolished concrete aggregates and crushed coarse tile aggregates can replace natural aggregates up to 30% and 60% respectively in the production of Grade 25 concrete. Furthermore, the study revealed that demolished concrete and demolished blocks in the form of fine aggregates can replace sand up to 30 % in proportion in the production of mortar. The direct cost analysis revealed that the use of demolished construction waste material to replace natural aggregates in the production of both concrete and mortar will be profitable only marginally.",2017
Development of an Improved Crack Propagation Model for Corrosion-Induced Cover Cracking in RC Structures,,,"During the last two decades, reinforced concrete (RC) has been extensively used in most of the world as one of the common construction material due to its advantages and durability. However, RC structures exposed to marine environments are subjected to chloride attack. Chlorides from seawater penetrate into RC structures are not only causing severe corrosion problems but also affect the durability and serviceability of such structures. This paper investigates the influence of transverse reinforcement and spacing of reinforcing bars on concrete cover cracking of two-way RC slab specimens using accelerated corrosion tests. The experimental program involved the testing of four RC slab specimens and was generally designed to observe the crack width and the time of crack to propagate. An improved model for predicting the timing of crack propagation based on the experimental data was then developed.",2017
Strength of Geopolymer Cement Curing at Ambient Temperature by Non-Oven Curing Approaches: An Overview,,FLY-ASH GEOPOLYMER; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; ALKALINE ACTIVATION; CONCRETE; DURABILITY; METAKAOLIN; MINERALS; BINDER; RATIO,"At the present day, a concept of environmentally friendly construction materials has been intensively studying to reduce the amount of releasing greenhouse gases. Geopolymer is one of the cementitious binders which can be produced by utilising pozzolanic wastes (e.g. fly ash or furnace slag) and also receiving much more attention as a low-CO2 emission material. However, to achieve excellent mechanical properties, heat curing process is needed to apply to geopolymer cement in a range of temperature around 40 to 90 degrees C. To consume less oven-curing energy and be more convenience in practical work, the study on geopolymer curing at ambient temperature (around 20 to 25 degrees C) is therefore widely investigated. In this paper, a core review of factors and approaches for non-oven curing geopolymer has been summarised. The performance, in term of strength, of each non-oven curing method, is also presented and analysed. The main aim of this review paper is to gather the latest study of ambient temperature curing geopolymer and to enlarge a feasibility of non-oven curing geopolymer development. Also, to extend the directions of research work, some approaches or techniques can be combined or applied to the specific properties for in-field applications and embankment stabilization by using soil-cement column.",2017

First, the role of construction and material manufacturing is evaluated within the full life cycle energy and CO2 emissions of a building, concluding that the issue of embodied energy justifies the use of less energy intensive materials. Then the article reviews the literature dealing with the energy requirements of wood based construction, in order to establish whether the use of this natural, low density construction material is more energy efficient than using brick, reinforced concrete and steel structures. According to our analysis, the vast majority of the studies found that the embodied energy is significantly lower in wood based construction when compared to inorganic materials. According to several authors, wood construction could save much energy and significantly reduce the emissions related to the building sector on the national level. Carbon sequestration, and the related mitigation of the global climate change effect, can be significant if the share of durable wooden buildings can be increased in the market, using sustainably produced raw materials that are handled responsibly at the end of their lifetime. Some conflicting studies make important points concerning the heat storage, recycling and on-site labour demands related to these structures. These sources contribute to a deeper understanding of the issue, but do not alter the basic conclusions concerning the benefits of wood based construction. Some important aspects of wood extraction, manufacturing and construction that can help minimising the embodied energy of wood based structures are also discussed in the study.",2017
Sulphuric Acid Resistant of Self Compacted Geopolymer Concrete Containing Slag and Ceramic Waste,,,"Malaysia is a one of the developing countries where the constructions of infrastructure is still ongoing, resulting in a high demand for concrete. In order to gain sustainability factors in the innovations for producing concrete, geopolymer concrete containing granulated blastfurnace slag and ceramics was selected as a cement replacement in concrete for this study. Since Malaysia had many ceramic productions and uses, the increment of the ceramic waste will also be high. Thus, a new idea to reuse this waste in construction materials have been tested by doing research on this waste. Furthermore, a previous research stated that Ordinary Portland Cement concrete has a lower durability compared to the geopolymer concrete. Geopolymer binders have been reported as being acid resistant and thus are a promising and alternative binder for sewer pipe manufacture. Lack of study regarding the durability of the geopolymer self-compacting concrete was also one of the problems. The waste will be undergoing a few processes in the laboratory in order to get it in the best form before undergoing the next process as a binder in geopolymer concrete. This research is very significant in order to apply the concept of sustainability in the construction field. In addition, the impact of this geopolymer binder is that it emits up to nine times less CO2 than Portland Cement.",2017

This work explores an approach to modeling of fracture of a brittle porous material. Available 3D digital data on the specimen geometry is converted into uniform finite element mesh consisting purely of elements of cubic shape. Fracture model is based on a series of linear solutions. Thus approach to linear modeling described in the previous papers could be utilized. Fracture is modeled by consecutive element erosion.

The approach described can be used for modeling fracture of uniform construction materials, also materials with inclusions under various mechanical and thermal loads.",2017
Natural Volcanic Tuff for Sustainable Concrete Industry,Concrete; Compression strength; Flexural strength; Modulus of rupture; Modulus of elasticity; Volcanic tuff,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; ADMIXTURE; TURKEY,"In this study, Jordanian volcanic tuff aggregates were used as a source of construction materials in concrete mixtures. Five concrete mixtures were prepared by replacing normal aggregate with volcanic tuff aggregate of similar size in ratios of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100%. The impacts of this replacement on concrete density, slump, bleeding, compressive strength, flexural strength, modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and stress-strain behavior were investigated. The results revealed an improvement in compressive strength and flexural strength at a replacement ratio of 25%, with concomitant reduction at higher replacement ratios. Modulus of elasticity, workability and unit weight decreased for all mixtures containing volcanic tuff. The impact of replacement on compressive strength was much higher than on flexural strength. Based on these results, it can be asserted that the addition of Jordanian volcanic tuff at a ratio of 25% will improve some characteristics with adverse impacts on the modulus of elasticity and workability.",2017
Compression Behavior of Confined Columns with High-Volume Fly Ash Concrete,,STRESS-STRAIN MODEL; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TERNARY,"The use of fly ash in ordinary concrete provides practical benefits to concrete structures, such as a gain in long-term strength, reduced hydration heat, improved resistance to chloride, and enhanced workability. However, few studies with high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete have been conducted that focus on the structural applications such as a column. Thus, there is a need to promote field applications of HVFA concrete as a sustainable construction material. To this end, this study investigated the compressive behavior of reinforced concrete columns that contain HVFA with a 50 percent replacement rate. Six columns were fabricated for this study. The study variables were the HVFA replacement rate, tied steel ratio, and tie steel spacing. The computed ultimate strength by the American Concrete Institute (ACI) code conservatively predicted the measured values, and, thus, the existing equation in the ACI code is feasible for confined RC columns that contain HVFA. In addition, an analysis model was calibrated based on the experimental results and is recommended for predicting the stress-strain relationship of confined reinforced concrete columns that contain HVFA.",2017
The Efficiency of Using Different Outer Wall Construction Materials to Achieve Thermal Comfort in Various Climatic Zones,natural construction materials; thermal comfort; clay architecture; adobe architecture,,"The traditional vernacular architecture that is based on natural construction materials such as clay and stone is the most effective way to achieve thermal and climatic comfort inside different architectural spaces. Despite their efficiency, these natural materials are deficient when building large-scale and high-rise buildings. These materials also need periodic maintenance to protect buildings from construction collapse, especially clay structures. After the industrial revolution, the architectural movement shifted towards high-rise and large-scale buildings through using artificial materials such as cement, steel and glass. These materials demonstrate mass production and quality in implementation, but they are not sustainable in terms of thermal comfort in most climate zones across the world. It would thus seem sensible to integrate the two types of construction materials, by using a skeletal system for the building made of concrete or steel, which guarantees the structure, and by using natural materials like clay or stone for the outer walls, which assures thermal and climatic comfort in the indoor spaces. The aim of this paper is to analyse a new construction method that combines the two different construction materials -natural and artificial - to discover which outer-wall material is more effective in terms of thermal comfort in different climatic zones by using simulation programs. The study constrains the concrete skeletal structure system and tests the efficiency of using different outer-wall construction materials to achieve thermal comfort in three different climatic zones.

Condition Assessment of Corroded Steel Rebar in Free Space using Synthetic Aperture Radar Images,Synthetic aperture radar imaging; steel rebar corrosion; RC structures; natural corrosion,,"Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging of construction materials offers civil engineers an opportunity to better assess the condition of aging civil infrastructures such as reinforced concrete ( RC) structures. Corrosion of steel rebar in RC structures is a major problem responsible for their premature failure and unexpected collapse. In this paper, SAR imaging is applied to the quantitative assessment of corroded steel rebar in free space as the first step toward the use of SAR imaging for subsurface sensing of aging RC structures. A 10 GHz stripmap SAR system was used inside an anechoic chamber. The bandwidth of the radar system was 1.5 GHz. Steel rebar specimens were artificially corroded to different levels by regularly applying a mist of 5% NaCl solution for different durations of time in order to simulate the condition of natural corrosion. Two sizes (No. 3 and No. 4) of steel rebar were used in this research. Different orientations of steel rebar were considered. Corrosion level was determined by measuring the mass loss of corroded steel rebar specimens. From our results, feasibility of SAR images for the condition assessment of corroded steel rebar was experimentally demonstrated. It was found that the presence of surface rust on corroded steel rebar reduces the amplitude in SAR images. The SAR image of corroded steel rebar also exhibited a distribution of SAR amplitudes different from the one of intact steel rebar. In addition, it was also found that there is an optimal range for the condition assessment of corroded steel rebar in free space. In our experiment, the optimal range was determined to be 30.4 cm.",2017
USE OF SEWAGE SLUDGE ASH IN CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS,,WATER TREATMENT PLANTS; LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE; FLUIDIZED-BED; CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL; COMBUSTION; CONCRETE; MORTARS; SSA; BEHAVIOR; MANUFACTURE,"The potential for using sewage sludge ash (SSA) in cement mortars and concrete is reviewed. The chemical and physical properties and pozzolanic activity of a range of different incinerated SSA samples indicates the potential to exploit the pozzolanic properties of this waste as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM). Using SSA as a SCM increases the water demand and reduces the workability, compressive strength and density of concrete mixes, although these adverse effects may be controlled by modifying the mix design. This represents a beneficial reuse application for a waste that is typically landfilled. However the use of SSA in cementitious materials must be carefully controlled because SSA varies significantly, depending on sludge production method and combustion conditions. Testing will therefore always be required to assess how a specific SSA behaves when incorporated in cementitious materials.",2017
Corrosion Detection of Reinforcement of Building Materials with Piezoelectric Sensors,Building materials; reinforced concrete; piezoelectric sensor; corrosion detection; ultrasound,REBAR CORROSION,"The extensive use of reinforced materials in the construction industry has raised increased concerns about their safety and durability, while corrosion detection of steel materials is becoming increasingly important. For the scientific management, timely repair and health monitoring of construction materials, as well as to ensure construction safety and prevent accidents, this paper investigates corrosion detection on construction materials based on piezoelectric sensors. At present, the commonly used corrosion detection methods include physical and electrochemical methods, but there are shortcomings such as large equipment area, low detection frequency, and complex operation. In this study an improved piezoelectric ultrasonic sensor was designed, which could not only detect the internal defects of buildings while not causing structural damage, but also realize continuous detection and enable qualitative and quantitative assessment. Corrosion detection of reinforced building materials with piezoelectric sensors is quick and accurate, which can find hidden dangers and provide a reliable basis for the safety of the buildings.",2017

Replacement scenarios for construction materials based on economy-wide hybrid LCA,construction materials; construction industry; engineered wood products; input-output modelling; residential and non-residential buildings,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CARBON FOOTPRINT; AUSTRALIA; GEOPOLYMER; EMISSIONS; CONCRETE; UK,"As part of the Integrated Carbon Metrics project, which comprehensively quantifies embodied GHG emissions related to the built environment in Australia, this contribution evaluates construction material replacement scenarios at the economy-wide scale. We investigate the potential use of Engineered Wood Products (EWPs) in new building stock to assess the carbon outcomes of a potentially significant shift in the use of construction materials. This becomes increasingly relevant as Australia moves forward with augmenting the National Construction Code to allow the construction of mid-rise buildings utilizing timber. The selection of low-carbon and sustainable building materials is crucial in reducing the built environment's carbon footprint. The main objective of the replacement scenario analysis is to assess the potential reduction in future GHG emissions by replacing the use of reinforced concrete with EWPs. The scenarios include the comparison of mid-rise buildings (10- story) with standard reference buildings (using reinforced concrete) at the national scale. The analysis considers the full cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of construction materials embedded in buildings. Since the scenarios are implemented in an input-output model of the Australian economy, changes in the use of construction materials can also be evaluated with respect to indirect effects on industries involved in the production chain of these materials as well as their respective GHG emissions.

Although the building occupant survey showed a high level of satisfaction with overall building design and performance, two main issues, 'thermal discomfort in summer' and 'noise from outside' were identified. Overheating in summer is not clearly understood in this study, however, it could be interpreted that passive design strategies such as cross ventilation and landscaped shared open space increased noise. A further research on the effects of building design on occupants such as engineered light-weight concrete floor, prefabricated building facade, cross-ventilation, operable openings and the cooling systems of the individual apartments is necessary to resolve the issues and to examine whether the poor thermal performance in summer could be related to modular construction. This case study building was developed as a commercially replicable pilot, providing affordable and sustainable high-density housing in Melbourne's inner suburbs. Thus, it is expected that this POE study could provide an insight into the interaction between the building and its occupants, particularly in the context of modular construction, and further contribute to developing high-performance modular multi-residential buildings.

Recycled concrete in structural applications for sustainable construction practices in Australia,Sustainability; recycled aggregate; natural concrete; construction industry,AGGREGATE CONCRETE; WASTE; DEMOLITION,"As the construction industry drives towards sustainability, recycling construction and demolition waste has become paramount. Furthermore, new construction material composed from recycled construction and demolition waste have added to these sustainable practices. The use of recycled aggregate has been explored to lead to a sustainable future as it provides an alternative to traditional natural concrete. Experimental investigations showed that concrete using recycled aggregate compared to natural aggregate have lower strength. For the construction industry to be sustainable, recycled aggregate must be widely used and even replace natural aggregate. However, research into recycled aggregate discovered the shortcomings of this material and the limiting factors to its utilisation due to its low strength. Several research studies attempt to improve the quality of recycled aggregate by either adding various additives or changing its production methods. However, the industry is still behind in the wider use of recycled aggregate using such research findings. Hence, a research question was formulated as 'what enablers and barriers affect utilisation of recycled aggregate concrete as a structural material?'. Qualitative interviews were conducted in the Australian construction industry to answer this research question, which provided useful enablers and barriers for promoting recycled aggregate as a structural material. Thereby, a ""soft"" analysis was conducted to motivate of building industry for using RAC. It is hoped that these findings will be useful for researchers, practitioners and policymakers who are responsible for creating a sustainable construction industry. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Engineered cementitious composites for modern civil engineering structures in hot arid coastal climatic conditions,ECC; composites; durability; self-healing; sustainability,DURABILITY,"Engineered Cementitious Composite (ECC) is an exclusive type of cement mixture with unique composition of low volume fibers and different composites so as to impart high ductility, high tensile strength besides ability to repair. Conventional concrete and fiber reinforced concrete has brittle nature and hence crack easily under environmental and mechanical loads affecting durability of structures. Efforts to modify the brittle nature of conventional concrete resulted in development of ECCs offering durability under a broad range of environmental exposure, low embodied energy, and negative carbon footprint making it environmentally sustainable construction material with self-healing potential. ECCs demonstrate tight crack width and development of these cracks in fact increase ability of ECCs to resist effects of hot, frost and humid weather conditions besides its low permeability coefficient and higher resistance to steel corrosion compared to other common substitutes. The paper attempts to discover suitability of ECC in a typical hot arid coastal region experiencing extreme harsh climate. It bear upon an in depth review to investigate potential of ECC, influence on pertinent engineering properties and its impact on construction industry in hot arid coastal climatic conditions.

EFFECTS OF SODIUM CHLORIDE ON THE PROPERTIES OF MAGNESIUM POTASSIUM PHOSPHATE CEMENT (MKPC) USING MAGNESIA WITH DIFFERENT REACTIVITIES,Magnesium potassium phosphates cement (MKPC); magnesium oxide (MgO); sodium chloride; calcination; compressive strength-setting time,CHEMICALLY BONDED CERAMICS; HYDRATION; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; MORTARS; REPAIR,"In order to control the reaction rate of magnesium potassium phosphate cement (MKPC) and to obtain a hardened material with good mechanical properties and prolonged setting time, sodium chloride was added as a set retarder. In addition to that, and for an economical construction material, this work focused on the combined effect of sodium chloride and magnesia characteristics in order to obtain the less calcined magnesia that gives with sodium chloride the desired material. The results showed that sodium chloride can reduce the reaction heat release and delay the setting time. The addition of NaCl in MPKC pastes prepared with magnesia calcined at 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C has a little influence on the retarding of the reaction and the enhancement of the compressive strength. However, the significant retarding effect was obtained using magnesia calcined at temperatures higher than 1000 degrees C. The testing results demonstrate that the best correlation between higher compressive strength and an adequate setting time was obtained using magnesia calcined at 1100 degrees C. For this sort of magnesia, the compressive strength development was investigated and the possible retarding mechanism was discussed.",2017

Wastes of different types (such as fibers, powders, granules, etc.) are used for obtaining construction materials. Concrete is one of the most used materials and in time it diversified. Near the ordinary concretes today a lot of new types of concretes had occurred. Fiber reinforced concrete is a special concrete in which wastes can be used for totally or partially replacement of mix components. For studying the influence of wastes on mechanical properties of cement concrete (green concrete), different dosages of cement were replaced by fly ash and also glass fiber or polyester fiber were added. The compressive strength, flexural strength and split tensile strength were experimentally determined. According to test results, the concrete with 10% replacement of cement with fly ash and fiber presented better results of compressive strength than the concrete without fiber. Glass fiber increased flexural strengths for small dosages of fly ash. Higher dosages of fly ash and glass fiber decreased the mechanical strength. Polyester fiber had increased the values of all flexural strength of fly ash cement concrete. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2017

A Decision Support System for the Condition Assessment of Distressed Concrete Buildings,,,"Concrete is one of the most versatile and durable construction material used worldwide. During its service life, concrete undergoes several deteriorations. The most prominent sign of deterioration is cracking. Cracks in structural concrete are similar to Hieroglyphics i.e. pictures which can communicate the damage. Since a considerable expertise is required to understand the pattern of cracking and failure, the tasks of diagnosing concrete deterioration are carried out by professional specialist. It's noteworthy that human expertise in this field is quite limited and expensive, which can lead to the investigation by inexperienced engineers and ultimately expensive misconceptions. Hence, there is a need to develop a user interface using engineering computation to support the visual examiner in decision making. This paper discusses a new support system named as ConASCon-16 developed by the authors for assessing concrete deterioration. The system uses fault trees as its rule. The interface has three modules namely REVIEW, SEEN and HIDDEN. The first module is a database on concrete deterioration, Visual Inspection and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) with appropriate photos to help the user/engineer understand, the second and third module specifies the cause of visible deteriorations and unseen distresses in concrete and predicts the condition of the structure by a simple questionnaire. A hypothetical case study has been described to demonstrate the applicability of ConASCon-16.",2017
Effects of construction material properties on dam type selection (Sariguzel Dam - Turkey),Geotechnical studies; Construction material; Sand-gravel filling; Sariguzel Dam,,"The availability of dam fill materials influenced the dam design considerably. Rockfill is one of the most preferred fill materials for embankment dam. Also, use of different fill material such as sand-gravel has been preferred in recent years. Previous studies on concrete-faced sand-gravel fill dam, results of the laboratory experiments and in situ testing analysis display that using sand-gravel as a fill material is not only cost-effective but also safe and provides high-quality natural construction material. This paper illustrates the importance of construction material properties on dam type selection. Sariguzel Dam is constructed on the Ceyhan River to the south-west of the Turkey.

The possible recycling opportunities of remaining inorganic fraction in the cement and concrete industry was also investigated. Flotation technique was used to separate unburned carbon from inorganic bottom ashes. Collector type, collector, dispersant and frother amounts, and pulp density are the most important variables in the flotation technique. A number of flotation collectors were tested in the experiments including new era flotation reactives. Optimum collector, dispersant and frother dosages as well as optimum pulp density were also determined. After experimental work, an inorganic fraction was obtained, which included 5.41% unburned carbon with 81.56% weight yield. These properties meets the industrial specifications for the cement and concrete industry. The carbon content of the concentrate fraction, obtained in the same experiment, was enhanced to 49.82%. This fraction accounts for 18.44% of the total amount and can be mixed to the power plant fuel.

Introduction of Innovation Technology as a Factor in Environmental Modernization in Russian Arctic,strategic planning; innovation development; sulfur-containing waste; Arctic; waste treatment; recycling,,"The paper considers the fundamentals of formation and realization of the modern Russian state environmental policy in the Arctic and analyzes environmental threats and challenges, including the impact of the mining and metallurgical complex on the environment. Coal industry and ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy are considered to be major producers and accumulators of waste. In the smelting of metals slags are formed, which are based on oxides. Sulfur oxides occupy one of the first places according to their negative impact on the environment. The present paper considers environmentally responsible business models in the Arctic, when the priority in management decisions is given to the issues of preserving nature and not just making profit. The main environmental issue is associated with the accumulation of waste in the places of concentration of objects of industry, transport, energy and social sphere in the confined spaces in those areas of the Arctic, where mineral deposits are exploited, raw materials are processed and transported. The industrial processing of secondary resources and recycling of sulfur in accordance with the principles of green production (recycling) are of special scientific interest. The authors propose the following innovative methods for solving the problems of ecological modernization in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation: utilization of sulfur-containing waste, recycling of technogenic wastes; the paper also analyzes operational and physical-mechanical properties of sulfur-extended asphalt concrete and sulfur concrete, and the possibilities of production of a new generation of building materials and road surfaces. High consumer properties of sulfur-containing construction materials - low cost of raw materials, workability of sulfur concrete and mortar mixes, fast development of strength, resistance to radiation and other aggressive environments, high frost and water resistance - make them competitive with traditional building materials that often cannot withstand the difficult climatic conditions of the North. The use of sulfur-containing waste in various economic sectors in the Arctic zone will significantly reduce the cost of products and designs and will contribute to the solution of one of the most important tasks of our time - protection of the environment from industrial pollution.",2017

A step-by-step procedure has been employed to design and optimize performance of the proposed antenna. First, a conventional antipodal Vivaldi antenna (CAVA) is designed as a reference. Second, the CAVA is shortened to have a small size of the CAVA. Third, to extend the low end of frequency band, the inner edges of the top and bottom radiators of the shortened CAVA have been bent. To enhance gain at lower frequencies, regular slit edge technique is employed. Finally, a half elliptical-shaped dielectric lens as an extension of the antenna substrate is added to the antenna to feature high gain and front-to-back ratio.

Positive findings from this study may help promote the recycling of waste SSA and MGP in construction works. The results indicated that the SSA decreased while MGP improved the mortar workability. The SSA exhibited very low pozzolanic activity, but the cement mortar prepared with 20% SSA yielded strength values slightly superior to those of the glass mortars due to its water absorption ability. MGP can serve as a pozzolan and when 20% of cement was replaced by MGP, apparent compressive strength gains were found at later curing ages. The SSA could be used to mitigate ASR expansion while the MGP was superior in resisting drying shrinkage.",2017
Toward bio-based geo- & civil engineering for a sustainable society,Bio-based processes; civil- and geo-engineering; soil; concrete; cement,IMPROVEMENT,"The since 2010 running research program 'Bio-Based Geo & Civil Engineering for a Sustainable Society (BioGeoCivil)', funded by the Dutch technology foundation STW, aims to develop novel bio-based construction materials that can be used in Civil- and Geo-engineering constructions to enhance the sustainability performance of the sector. Rationale is that the sector produces still today excess amounts of waste in all life cycle phases of a construction, from building to use phase as well as end-of-life phase. Aim of the program is to mimic nature as 'building' processes in nature do not produce any waste as all elements, also residual material. is considered a high grade resource. In order to substantially improve the sustainability profile of the sector, upgrading of secondary- or byproducts must be achieved to allow functional performance similar to primary materials and resources. The challenge of the six currently running projects within the BioGeoCivil program is therefore not only to mimic nature but also to include bio-based materials or processes in civil- or geo-engineering applications which result, in comparison to traditional building products, in drastically improved performance both on sustainability and durability level. The six projects comprise: 1. Fungal biofilms (coating) for wood protection, 2. Bacteria-based repair and performance improvements of aged concrete structures, 3. Bacteria-based ground stabilization to mitigate liquefaction and piping of granular sediments, 4. Engineering of bacterial biofilms on buildings and infrastructure as a basis for natural protection, 5.

Experimental study of fly ash density effect to the mortar compressive strength with recycled fine aggregate,Fly Ash; Recycled Concrete Aggregate; Packing Density; Compressive Strength; Mortar Mixing,,"Massive production of fly ash and recycled concrete aggregate from various sources such as industries, demolished buildings and so on has been seen as a threatening environmental waste from the conservative material engineering perspective. However, in recent years, the utilization of waste materials in mixed concrete have been turned upside down to become an alternative in producing eco-friendly construction materials. Therefore, this study is aimed to observe the mortar compressive strength that consists of cement, water, recycled fine aggregate and specifically fly ash whose amount is determined based on the packing density method. Several mixing variations are used to derive the correlation between fly ash density and mortar compressive strength. Three different fly ash percentages, which are 25% (loose), 35% (completely) and 45% (over) are used in the laboratory test with the variations of mixing ratios of 0.2, 0.35, and 0.5. The mortar under completely packaged condition delivers the highest compressive strength in any mixing ratio, which are found at 27.02 MPa, 30.26 MPa, and 32.15 MPa for respectively 0.2, 0.35 and 0.5 mixing ratio. Conclusively, this particular pattern indicates the suitability of packing density method usage as the basic to determine the optimum fly ash amount in mortar mixing. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Utilization of polystyrene waste for wall panel to produce green construction materials,Polystyrene; panels; pre-compaction; waste; flexural; stiffness,,"The wall structure separating floor areas significantly contribute the weight of the building that put it into a greater risk to earthquake event. The use of lighter wall materials is more desirable to reduce the potential risk of damage due to earthquake treat. This development of polystyrene wall panel is an effort to achieve two objectives, namely development light wall material and promoting green construction materials by utilizing polystyrene waste. The paper present the study on the development of polystyrene waste wall panel by pre-compacted method. In this research, the shredded polystyrene was blended with cement Portland and water at various certain proportion. When the mixed already properly blended, it was poured into the steel mold of 30x80cm. The mixed within the mold was subjected to compaction stress for up to 2 MPa that reduce the thickness of the mixed into about 1 cm. The polystyrene panel was kept in the humid zone for curing for about 28 days. They were 12 wall panel specimens made for this purpose. Result of test show that at the same compaction stress, higher cement content produces stronger polystyrene concrete. The average compressive strength of specimens with 250 kg/m(3) and 300 kg/m(3) cement content are 4.9 MPa and 5.3 MPa, respectively, and for flexural strength are 2.4 MPa and 3.3 MPa, respectively. The result show that the compressive strength of concrete matrix and flexural strength panel are significantly high. However, under repeated loading of about 10% of maximum load, the panels experience decrease in stiffness in each load cycles suggesting the low tensile capacity of the concrete matrix. These results indicate the potential use of polystyrene wall panel for construction materials purposes with further attention on improvement the tensile characteristic of the concrete matrix.

Phosphogypsum, a byproduct in phosphoric acid manufacturing process, produced in bulk quantity especially from the fertilizer industry, typically used as a supplementary fertilizer for soil treatment. Alternatively, disposal of these materials in the form of landfill also need huge land area although environmental hazard concern from these activities has been raised by researches. The material has therefore, tried to incorporate in cement manufacturing considering its sustainable use. Phosphogypsum could be used as a substitute of natural gypsum in the production of Portland cement to control the hydration reaction rate of cement. In this study, raw phosphogypsum was collected from a local fertilizer industry. Properties of phosphogypsum were evaluated and then the effect of various level phosphogypsum addition (2, 5, 10 and 15 percent by weight of cement) with Portland cement clinker was investigated. The raw material was treated to remove additional water and impurity by washing, air drying and oven drying. Both treated and untreated materials were used in experimental work. Setting time, flow and compressive strength behavior of the prepared paste, mortar and concrete samples were evaluated to find an effective percentage of phosphogypsum to be used in Portland cement manufacturing. By evaluating properties of cement paste, mortar and concrete it was concluded that 5-10% phosphogypsum addition in cement clinker gave good results.

Seismic behavior of fiber reinforced steel-concrete composite systems,Steel fibers; carbon nano fibers; steel-concrete composite systems; SC panels,,"The addition of Steel Fibers (SF) to concrete has been widely studied in the past decades as a mean to control its crack behavior and maintain its ductility in tension. It has been verified that the use of these fibers at an appropriate dosage can change the behavior of structural members from brittle to ductile. Further, since the discovery of carbon nanotubes/fibers (CNT/CNF), they have been also considered as efficient fibers to be used in construction materials such as concrete. Previous experimental work has shown that incorporation of CNF in cementitious composites can enhance the mechanical behavior of material by reducing the size of macro- and micro-cracks resulting in higher strength and ductility. In addition, due to tunnel conductivity effect, CNF concrete exhibits properties necessary for self-sensing and self-health monitoring ability. This study aims to expand upon the use of SF and CNF concrete in structural members focusing on Steel-Concrete (SC) double skin Composite systems. SC systems are quickly gaining popularity in the nuclear power industry worldwide mainly because of their many advantages such as modular and accelerated construction, cost effectiveness, good strength properties for given size members, in addition to excellent seismic and blast resistance. The use of both SF and CNF fiber reinforced concrete in SC systems could potentially be advantageous under normal and hazard loading conditions.

However, the potential leaching of toxic elements (e. g. alkaline elements and heavy metals) from the BA mixed with milled HMA and crushed PCC is still a concern when used as 2nd-cycle recycled materials. This paper presents and discusses the chemical characteristics and leaching behaviour of MSWI BA when used in both HMA and PCC. Chemical analysis of MSWI BA was conducted by using petrographic analysis tools. The leaching characteristics of major alkaline and trace elements from the milled HMA and crushed PCC containing varied amounts of BA were investigated by Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure (SPLP) batch testing. The release of most alkaline and heavy metals (except Mg and Si from HMA and Ca from PCC) is reduced when mixed with the HMA and PCC as adding 10-20% of BA due to the binding effect in asphalt and cement mixtures. The concentrations of most major alkaline elements (e. g. Ca, Al, Si, and Na) from the HMA and PCC with BA increased with increasing elapsed time due to availability controlled leaching. The release of all of the priority elements meets the criteria of the US Secondary Drinking Water Standard (except Al) and the EPA Multi-Sector General Permit for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Industrial Activity.",2017

New variants of breathable concrete, made using lightweight and synthetic aggregates (as opposed to natural, normal density aggregates), are presented. Breathable concretes made using lightweight aggregates have better thermal insulation properties due to the presence of air voids, lower thermal conductivity of aggregates, and lower specific density.

The enhancement in strength with hydration period was due to the conversion of fluorogypsum into gypsum through formation of intermediate unstable salt. The reaction products were characterised using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. SEM studies showed the appearance of prismatic and needle-shaped crystals of variable sizes interspersed with anhydrate fluorogypsum plaster which make matrix dense and compact. This change in morphology of anhydrite plaster is responsible for enhancement in strength, reduction in water absorption and porosity of cement-free binders. The engineering properties of the construction materials for use in plastering, masonry works, concrete, blocks and tiles developed from this binder are reported.",2017
PREPARATION OF ULTRA-LOW VOLUME WEIGHT AUTOCLAVED AERATED CONCRETE,Aerated concrete; Foam stability; Optimization; Low volume weight,HYDROGEN GENERATION; PARTICLES; FOAMS; WATER,"Autoclaved aerated concrete is a modern construction material that gains its popularity especially due to its thermal insulation performance resulting front low volume weight and porous structure with sufficient mechanical strength. Nowadays, there are attempts to use this material for thermal insulation purposes and to replace current systems, which have many disadvantages, mainly concerning durability. The key for improvement of thermal insulation properties is therefore obtaining a material based on autoclaved aerated concrete with extremely low volume weight (below 200 kg-m(-3)) ensuring good thermal isolation properties, but with sufficient mechanical properties to allow easy manipulation. This material can be prepared by foaming very fine powder materials such as silica fume or very finely ground sand. This paper deals with the possibilities of preparation and summaries the basic requirements for successful preparation of such a material.",2017

Weight loss and release of calcium are observed when materials, especially concrete, are exposed to fungi. The paper presents the procedures enabling to assess the risk of biocorrosion of buildings at various stages of its development. The presented results lead to selection of effective analytical methodology for this propose. The study was conducted on materials commonly used as construction materials such as granite, ceramic, concrete and plaster. Surfaces of the tested samples were fouled by three selected fungal genera. Changes in properties of the materials due to interaction of fungi have been studied with the use of ergosterol content measurements, microscopic picturing, bioluminescence imaging, measurements of pH and X-ray spectroscopy analysis. Particular attention was paid to propose an appropriate method of estimating the effect of fungi on the surface of building materials using advanced analytical techniques.",2017
SHEAR STRENGTH OF REINFORCED RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE BEAMS WITHOUT SHEAR REINFORCEMENTS,recycled coarse aggregate; reinforced concrete beams; shear strength; replacement level; recycled aggregate concrete; shear behaviour,BOND BEHAVIOR; BARS,"As the demand for sustainable construction materials has risen over recent years, researchers have conducted several studies to expand the practical application of recycled construction materials, such as recycled aggregate. The author's previous research shows the potential application of recycled aggregate over a broad range of structural member types. This paper continues the earlier work and investigates the shear behaviour of reinforced recycled aggregate concrete beams without shear reinforcement using findings from the author's previous research. The variables in the test program are replacement rate (0%, 30%, 60%, and 100%) of recycled aggregate and shear span-to-depth ratio (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0). This work compares the experimental results with results obtained using current code equations found in American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318 (2014) and equations proposed in the literature. This research has found that the current code equations can adequately predict the shear strength of recycled coarse aggregate concrete beams and possibly can be applied for the use of recycled aggregate in structural elements.",2017
Microwave-Assisted Synthesis and Thermal Resistance of Calcium Sulfate Whiskers,Calcium sulfate whiskers; Coating; Microwave heating; Thermal resistance; Wastewater,METHANOL ELECTROOXIDATION; POROUS CERAMICS; WASTE-WATER; METAL-IONS; HEMIHYDRATE; CONDUCTIVITY; MORPHOLOGY; LIME,"The improved thermal resistance from the paint mixed with CaSO4 whiskers on different substrates (i.e., concrete pillar, stainless steel foil, and calcium silicate plate) has been investigated. An efficient microwave-assisted method is used to synthesize CaSO4 whiskers from wastewater. Experimental results reveal that the addition of CaSO4 whiskers provides a thermal barrier against the heat transfer. The temperature difference between the painting with and without the CaSO4 whiskers exceeds 13 degrees C, indicating superior thermal-insulating performance. The presence of CaSO4 whiskers is capable of providing a fire barrier against the flame at 900 degrees C. The enhanced performance can be attributed to the fact that the CaSO4 whiskers possess an endothermic nature and a high melting temperature (i.e., 1460 degrees C). Accordingly, the introduction of CaSO4 whiskers facilitated not only the thermal barrier but also fire protection of construction coatings, suitably complementing the thermal management for green architecture or buildings. Since the CaSO4 whiskers were prepared from industrial wastewater, the two-step microwave-assisted method offers a straightforward way to produce green construction materials because of its pollutant reduction, non-toxicity, low cost, and environmental friendliness.",2017
Bond Slip Models for Uncorroded and Corroded Steel Reinforcement in Class-F Fly Ash Geopolymer Concrete,Geopolymer concrete; Bond; Corrosion,CORROSION-INDUCED CRACKING; STRENGTH; MEMBERS; BEHAVIOR; BEAM; BARS; PERFORMANCE; WIDTH; SLAG,"Geopolymer concrete is an innovative construction material that utilizes industrial by-product waste materials to form a cement replacement for concrete manufacture. In order to simulate the behavior of reinforced concrete at all load levels, an understanding of the bond between the reinforcement and the concrete is required. That is, at the serviceability limit state, the bond between the reinforcement and the concrete controls the formation of cracks, crack widening, and tension stiffening. Similarly, adequate bond between the reinforcement and the concrete is required at the ultimate limit state to ensure the full capacity of the reinforcement is obtained. Over time, the bond between the reinforcement and concrete can deteriorate due to corrosion, thus impacting the overall performance of a structure. This paper presents a wide-ranging study of the bond between reinforcement and geopolymer concrete including an investigation of the influence of corrosion. This study involved 102 pull-out test specimens covering a range of parameters including bar diameter, concrete cover-to-diameter ratio, com-pressive strength, and level of corrosion. Significantly, this study shows that the bond between reinforcement and geopolymer concrete is stronger than that between reinforcement and ordinary portland cement.

Empirical Validation of Heat Transfer Performance Simulation of Graphite/PCM Concrete Materials for Thermally Activated Building System,,PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; OCTADECANE/XGNP SSPCM; ENVELOPES; MORTAR,"To increase the heat capacity in lightweight construction materials, a phase change material (PCM) can be introduced to building elements. A thermally activated building system (TABS) with graphite/PCM concrete hollow core slab is suggested as an energy-efficient technology to shift and reduce the peak thermal load in buildings. An evaluation of heat storage and dissipation characteristics of TABS in graphite/PCM concrete has been conducted using dynamic simulations, but empirical validation is necessary to acceptably predict the thermal behavior of graphite/PCM concrete. This study aimed to validate the thermal behavior of graphite/PCM concrete through a three-dimensional transient heat transfer simulation. The simulation results were compared to experimental results from previous studies of concrete and graphite/PCM concrete. The overall thermal behavior for both materials was found to be similar to experiment results. Limitations in the simulation modeling, which included determination of the indoor heat transfer coefficient, assumption of constant thermal conductivity with temperature, and assumption of specimen homogeneity, led to slight differences between the measured and simulated results.",2017

One such material of abundant source is basalt. The use of basalt in different forms like fibre, rod, grid and laminates has captured the interest of society from the 20th century onwards. Lately, basalt fibre has attracted attention as a possible construction material due to its properties such as high modulus of elasticity, high elastic strength, corrosion resistance, high-temperature resistance, extended operating temperature range and ease of handling. This paper explores the state of the art of basalt used in the construction industry with the overall layout of different subcategories of historical background starting from fibre development and different chemical and mechanical fibre properties to its applications in the field. Comparative studies have also been reported with respect to other high-strength fibre like glass, steel and carbon fibre based on different physical, chemical and mechanical properties. Along with these, a review has been done on the usage of different basalt products like aggregate, rod, fibre, mesh, etc. in structural applications. The review also tends to identify critical constraints that restrain the implementation of basalt as a global construction material, thereby opening avenues of needed research. An insight on inconsistency reported in the literature with respect to the behaviour of basalt-fibre-reinforced composites is also expressed in this paper. The overall idea is to gain information and identify and prioritize research areas of the possible applications of basalt towards sustainable construction.",2017
Cure kinetics and physical characterization of epoxy/modified boehmite nanocomposites,Organically modified boehmite; nanocomposites; dynamic mechanical thermal analysis; DMTA; differential scanning calorimetry; DSC; flexural tests,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; EPOXY NANOCOMPOSITES; COMPOSITES; EVOLUTION; ADHESIVES; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; HYBRIDS; RESINS,"Nanocomposites based on a cross-linked epoxy matrix with the addition of a reinforcing organically modified boehmite nano-phase were realized and characterized with the aim to produce systems possessing enhanced properties over commercial epoxy systems. Different amounts of a commercially available organically modified boehmite were added to a diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) epoxy matrix. The rheological characteristic and kinetic behavior of the liquid nano-filled mixtures were analyzed and compared to those displayed by the un-filled resin. A mathematical model was applied to the experimental rheological data in order to assess the aspect ratio of the nano-filler. A proper equation was employed to model the cure kinetics of the nano-filled epoxy systems. The nanocomposites were heat-cured in the presence of an aromatic amine hardener. They were, then, characterized by scanning electron microscopy with EDS analysis, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and Flexural and Hardness tests. Significant increase in the glass transition temperature, Shore D hardness and maximum flexural strength was found. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the o-boehmite nano-filler to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the epoxy resin. Further studies are in progress to verify the protective efficiency of the epoxy-boehmite nanocomposite when applied on different substrates as adhesive or coating for construction materials, such as porous stones, concrete, wood, and metal.",2017
Utilization of coal bottom ash to improve thermal insulation of construction material,Bottom ash; Fine aggregate replacement; Thermal conductivity; Microstructure,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; FLY-ASH; FINE AGGREGATE; PARTIAL REPLACEMENT; COPPER SLAG; WASTE; MORTARS,"Concerns with sustainable solid waste management and recycling have become increasingly prominent in all sectors of the economy. In light of this, this research investigates the possibility of utilizing coal bottom ash (waste from thermal power plants) as a substitute for fine aggregate in mortar and concrete. The chemical composition, microstructure and mechanical properties, including workability, density, water absorption, compressive strength and thermal conductivity, of mortar and concrete incorporating coal bottom ash in partial and full replacement of sand were investigated, and the results were compared to the data for conventional mortar and concrete. The results show that the density of mortar and concrete was noticeably decreased with increasing coal bottom ash content. In addition, despite the permeable pore space of mortars and concretes increasing with increasing levels of coal bottom ash, the use of coal bottom ash does not significantly affect the compressive strength of concrete. Furthermore, the mortars and concretes containing coal bottom ash exhibited good thermal insulation properties; thermal conductivity values decreased significantly with increasing coal bottom ash content, and the thermal conductivity of mortar and concrete with 100 % coal bottom ash showed a decrease of 68.61 and 46.91 %, respectively, as compared to that of the control.",2017
Engineering and environmental evaluation of spent coffee grounds stabilized with industrial by-products as a road subgrade material,Coffee grounds; Cement; Lime; Fly ash; Slag; Subgrade,CALCIUM CARBIDE RESIDUE; RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT; CONCRETE AGGREGATE BLENDS; FLY-ASH; SOIL STABILIZATION; RECYCLED CONSTRUCTION; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; LEACHING BEHAVIOR; CONTAMINATED SOIL; STEEL SLAG,"Current construction technology increasingly seeks the sustainable usage of waste by-products as a resource material. This paper evaluates the viability of utilizing spent coffee grounds (CG), a highly organic beverage waste, to be stabilized as a road subgrade material. The additives used in this research incorporates industrial by-products such as fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (S) as well as traditional binders such as portland cement (PC) and hydrated lime (L). CG collected from a coffee roaster were mixed with controlled additive content ratios by mass to assess the effects of these common engineering stabilizers towards the load-bearing capacity of CG. The additive contents of FA and S were 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 % whereas the PC and L additive contents were 3 and 5 % by dry unit weight. Modified proctor compaction tests, 7-days unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests, and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were carried out to determine the optimum moisture content and bearing strength of the different mixes produced. It found that as the proportion of additives in the specimen increased, the optimum moisture content of the additive-stabilized CG specimens subsequently decreased. Regardless of the type of stabilizers used, the UCS strength increases were found to be nominal. FA and S mixes above the 20 % additive contents satisfied the requirements for subgrade materials; however, the low PC and L contents were insufficient to meet subgrade requirements. The research findings indicate that instead of being disposed of into landfills, stabilized CG has the potential to be used as a subgrade material. Such a sustainability driven approach for reuse of CG will have the potential to divert CG from landfills and at the same time utilize CG as a viable construction material.",2017

The necessary physical and chemical tests were conducted on a bio-briquette ash sample to investigate its suitability for the development of bricks. Physico-mechanical, durability and thermal conductivity tests were conducted on cellular light weight bio-briquette ash bricks that fulfilled the requirements of Indian standard. The test results of cellular light weight bio-briquette ash bricks were compared with commercially available fly ash bricks. With reference to fly ash bricks, the cellular light weight bio-briquette ash bricks were found 43 % light in weight, having 13 % higher compressive strength and resulted in 66 % lesser thermal conductivity. A small scale model room (1 m x 1 m x 1 m) made up of fly ash bricks was designed. A similar built form for the cellular light weight bio-briquette ash bricks was also modelled. Both the models were analysed for indoor temperature control and cost. When compared with fly ash model room, cellular light weight bio-briquette ash brick model resulted in a 6 % better indoor temperature control and 29 % cost savings. Thus, the developed cellular light weight bio-briquette ash bricks were found suitable as an alternate construction material for non-load bearing walls.",2017
Engineering Behavior of Concrete with Recycled Aggregate,,,"Concrete is extensively used as construction materials in Malaysia. Concrete contributes suitable feature for construction industry for instance durability, adequate compressive strength, fire resistance, availability and is economic as compared to other construction materials. Depletion of natural resources and disposal of construction and demolition waste remarkably claim environmental threat. In this paper, the engineering behavior, durability, and concrete microstructure of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) on short-term concrete properties were investigated. The studied concrete at design mix proportion of 1:0.55:2.14:2.61 (weight of cement :coarse aggregates :sand :water) used to obtain medium-high compressive strength with 20%, 50%, and 100% of RCA. Results show that for the same water/cement ratio, RCA replacement up to 50% still achieved the targeted compressive strength of 25 MPa at 28 curing days. Addition, at similar RCA replacement, the highest carbonation depth value was found at 1.03 mm which could be attributed to the pozzolanic reaction, thus led to lower carbonation resistance. Scanning electron microscopy microstructure shows that the RCA surface was porous and covered with loose particles. Moreover, the interfacial transition zone was composed of numerous small pores, micro cracks, and fissures that surround the mortar matrix. On the basis of the obtained results, recommendable mineral admixtures of RCA are necessary to enhance the quality of concrete construction.",2017
Suitability of Coconut Shell Concrete for Precast Cool Wall Panel-A Review,,AGGREGATE; STRENGTH,"The cost for producing concrete has been increasing steadily. Therefore, the demand for using agricultural waste as a replacement or admixture inside concrete is also increasing gradually. Many researchers are doing research on agricultural waste such as palm oil, corn cobs, rice husks and coconut shells. Agricultural waste is increasingly being utilized in cement, concrete and other construction materials and provides numerous indirect benefits such as reduction in land fill cost, saving energy and protecting the environment from possible pollution. The aim is to produce concrete with improved properties at a lower cost and to maintain environmental sustainability. In this review paper, the suitability of coconut shell for concrete cool wall panels will be the main focus. Coconut shells can be used as aggregates in concrete. The characteristic properties of coconut shell concrete such as workability, bulk density, compressive strength, flexural tensile, water absorption and thermal performance were reviewed in this paper. This paper attempts to answer whether coconut shell is suitable to be used in concrete to produce a concrete cool wall panel in order to reduce heat transfer inside a building.",2017
Measurements of air dose rates in and around houses in the Fukushima Prefecture in Japan after the Fukushima accident,Indoor dose rate; Reduction factor; Uncontaminated effect; Man-borne survey; Fukushima accident,NUCLEAR-POWER-PLANT; CHERNOBYL ACCIDENT; POPULATION; RADIATION; SYSTEM,"Measurements of air dose rates for 192 houses in a less contaminated area (<0.5 mu Sv h(-1)) of the Fukushima Prefecture in Japan were conducted in both living rooms and/or bedrooms using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dosimeters and around the houses via a man-borne survey at intervals of several meters. The relation of the two air dose rates (inside and outside) for each house, including the background from natural radionuclides, was divided into several categories, determined by construction materials (light and heavy) and floor number, with the dose reduction factors being expressed as the ratio of the dose inside to that outside the house. For wooden and lightweight steel houses (classed as light), the dose rates inside and outside the houses showed a positive correlation and linear regression with a slope-intercept form due to the natural background, although the degree of correlation was not very high. The regression coefficient, i.e., the average dose reduction factor, was 0.38 on the first floor and 0.49 on the second floor. It was found that the contribution of natural radiation cannot be neglected when we consider dose reduction factors in less contaminated areas. The reductions in indoor dose rates are observed because a patch of ground under each house is not contaminated (this is the so-called uncontaminated effect) since the shielding capability of light construction materials is typically low. For reinforced steel-framed concrete houses (classed as heavy), the dose rates inside'the houses did not show a correlation with those outside the houses due to the substantial shielding capability of these materials. The average indoor dose rates were slightly higher than the arithmetic mean value of the outdoor dose rates from the natural background because concrete acts as a source of natural radionuclides. The characteristics of the uncontaminated effect were clarified through Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that there is a great variation in air dose rates even within one house, depending on the height of the area and its closeness to the outside boundary. Measurements of outdoor dose rates required consideration of local variations depending on the environment surrounding each house. The representative value was obtained from detailed distributions of air dose rates around the house, as measured by a man-borne survey. Therefore, it is imperative to recognize that dose reduction factors fluctuate in response to various factors such as the size and shape of a house, construction materials acting as a shield and as sources, position (including height) within a room, floor number, total number of floors, and surrounding environment.

Influence of variations in CO2 emission data upon environmental impact of building construction,Embodied CO2 emission; LCA database variation; Sustainable design,REINFORCED-CONCRETE COLUMNS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; STRUCTURAL DESIGN; CARBON; COST; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM; FRAMES,"To reduce CO2 emissions from the manufacturing phase of building materials, sustainable structural design has been introduced. However, embodied CO2 emission data in construction materials vary significantly depending on life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques, nations, and the time of data formation. In the embodied CO2 emission data used in recent literature, the percentage differences in CO2 emission data for concrete and steel as two typical building materials found to be 267 and 863%, respectively. These variations cause significantly different results in sustainable structural design. Thus, to avoid the dependency on the selection of embodied CO2 emission data, a sustainable design model with a new design variable of CS-factor is proposed. It is found that CS-factor ranged from 0.0208 to 0.4545 for current embodied CO2 emission data. It is revealed that the environmental impact for construction of the same beam structure can be increased by more than 9.65 times (from 191.7 to 1851.1) due to the variation in CO2 emission data. Also, the total construction cost for the same beam can be increased by 152.4% due to the variation. For the future of the construction industry, it should be noted that building construction based on available embodied CO2 emission data may not be a solution for green construction.

Effects of heavy weight waste glass recycled as fine aggregate on the mechanical properties of mortar specimens,Heavy weight waste glass; Mechanical properties; Unit volume weight; Radiation shielding performance; Pore size distribution,CRT FUNNEL GLASS; SHIELDING PROPERTIES; CEMENT MORTAR; LCD GLASS; CONCRETE; SAND,"The quantities of heavy weight waste glass have increased over time due to rapid industrialization and changes in the, quality of life. Moreover, most of this waste is not recycled. Concrete is the most widely used construction material, the huge amounts of natural resources are required to make concrete. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the possibility of recycling of heavy weight waste glass as an ingredient in the manufacturing of concrete. In this study, the suitability of heavy weight waste glass as a fine aggregate material is considered. The results of flow test, unit volume weight, radiation shielding performance, compressive strength, flexural strength, and micropore and macropore distribution of mortar are compared and evaluated. It was found that when the heavy weight waste glass substitution ratio increases, the fluidity, unit volume weight and radiation shielding performance also increase. However, the compressive and flexural strength of mortar gradually decrease with an increase in the substitution ratio of heavy weight waste glass. Moreover, the micro pore size distribution is significantly affected by the substitution of heavy weight waste glass. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2017
Non-organic solid wastes - potential resource for construction materials,Aggregates; construction materials; iron ore tailings; solid waste,DEMOLITION WASTE; FINE AGGREGATE; COPPER SLAG; CONCRETE; DEBRIS; INDIA,"Construction industry consumes natural resources in bulk quantities for various products such as bricks/blocks, mortar, concrete, etc. Indiscriminate exploitation of natural resources to meet the ever-expanding needs of the construction sector is posing serious environmental concerns and resulting in scarcity of natural raw materials. At the same time, a large volume of non-organic solid waste (NOSW) is being generated through various anthropogenic activities. It is challenging to find environmentally safe and economically viable solutions for handling such waste materials. This article discusses the construction industry scenario in India, some estimates of NOSW and strategies for their utilization. Few case studies of R&D work on the possibilities of utilizing NOSW for construction products are illustrated. In particular, the technical feasibility of utilizing construction and demolition (C&D) waste and iron ore tailings (IOT) as raw materials for construction products is highlighted. Experimental results presented here on the properties of mortar and concrete when C&D waste and IOT are used as an alternative to fine aggregate for replacing the scarce river sand are promising, showing immense potential for utilizing NOSW for the manufacture of construction products and materials.",2016
Flexible formwork technologies - a state of the art review,fabric formwork; flexible formwork; disruptive innovation; optimization; construction,FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE; FABRIC FORMWORK; DESIGN; SHELLS; CONSTRUCTION; OPTIMIZATION; PROTOTYPE; SURFACE; BEAMS,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material. Worldwide consumption of cement, the strength-giving component in concrete, is now estimated to be 4.10 Gt per year, having risen from 2.22 Gt just 10 years ago. This rate of consumption means that cement manufacture alone is estimated to account for 5.2 % of global carbon dioxide emissions. Concrete offers the opportunity to create structures with almost any geometry economically. Yet its unique fluidity is seldom capitalized upon, with concrete instead being cast in rigid, flat moulds to create non-optimized geometries that result in structures with a high material usage and large carbon footprints. This paper will explore flexible formwork construction technologies that embrace the fluidity of concrete to facilitate the practical construction of concrete structures with complex and efficient geometries. This paper presents the current state of the art in flexible formwork technology, highlighting practical uses, research challenges and new opportunities.",2016
HANDLING OF UNCERTAINTIES IN ATTRIBUTING THERMOSHOCK IN FIBROUS CONCRETE STRENGTH: A PROBABILISTIC APPROACH,Fibrous concrete; Normal distribution; Probability; Quality control; Reliability; Thermoshock,,"Hallmark professionalism in probabilistic analysis is to quantify the uncertainties involved in construction materials subject to intrinsic randomness in its physical and mechanical properties and is now gaining popularity in civil engineering arena. As well, knowledge of behaviour of materials is continuously evolving and its statistical descriptors are also changing when more and more data collected or even data updated and hence reliability analysis has to be carried out with the updated data as a continuous process. As per the committee report ACI 544.2R, it is found that there is no attempt made for probabilistic relation between cube compressive strength and cylinder compressive strength for fiber reinforced concrete. In consequence of this report, a robust relation between cube and cylinder of experimentally conducted compressive strength was established by Monte-Carlo simulation technique for different types of fibrous concrete like steel, alkali resistant glass and polyester fibrous concrete before and after thermoshock considering various uncertainties. Nevertheless simulated probabilistic modals, characteristic modals, optimized factor of safety and allowable designed cylinder compressive strength have been developed from the drawn probability of failure graph, which exhibits robust performance in realistic Civil Engineering materials and structures.",2016
Durability of Hybrid Composite Beam Bridges Subjected to Various Environmental Conditioning,Durability; Glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites; Hybrid composite beam; Synergistic effects; Microstructural analysis; Alkaline environment; Salt fog; Sustained stress,FRP; DEGRADATION; CONCRETE,"The hybrid composite beam (HCB) is a novel idea that combines conventional construction materials (i.e., steel and concrete) with fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in a new configuration. This hybridization aims to optimize the beam's structural performance and produce a structural element that is more durable than conventional members. This study examined the durability of a commercial glass FRP (GFRP) laminate that was used to encase the HCB elements in a recently constructed HCB bridge. The E-glass/vinyl ester laminate was subjected to five aging regimes. These conditioning regimes simulated an alkaline attack, a salt attack, a salt attack that was preceded by ultraviolet (UV) irradiation exposure, and sustained stresses that were accompanied by controlled thermal cycles and natural weathering. The durability of the E-glass/vinyl ester laminate was examined in terms of changes that occurred in the ultimate tensile strength. A microstructural analysis was performed on both unconditioned and conditioned specimens via optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The microstructural analysis revealed that the hydroxide and chloride ions penetrated the laminate through the existing voids and cracks without causing hydrolysis to the vinyl ester resin. Both the alkaline and the salt solutions caused fiber-matrix debonding and reduced the glass fibers load-bearing through physico-chemical processes (leaching and the dissolution of fibers). The tensile strength was reduced greatly under the alkali attack. The mechanical testing and the microstructural analysis provided fundamental insight into the durability and stress corrosion mechanisms of the examined GFRP shell under different environmental effects. This information is valuable to enhance the GFRP shell's durability. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2016

In this study, the interface frictional characteristics of organic soil and a variety solid construction materials, including concrete, steel, and wood, were investigated. The interface friction angles of organic soil-solid surfaces were determined for different water content and granular soil content. In addition, the relationship between surface roughnesses and interface friction was investigated. All tests in this study were performed using a direct shear test device under different normal stresses.

Because the properties of BA are similar to those of natural aggregates, it is suitable to be recycled as construction material. However, pretreatment processes for BA reuse may require more resource input and may generate additional environmental impacts. Life cycle assessment, multi-media transport model analysis, cost-benefit analysis and the analytical hierarchy process were conducted to evaluate the impacts of current and potential BA management scenarios regarding environmental, economic, social and regulatory aspects. The five analysed scenarios are as follows: (0) BA buried with construction and demolition waste (current system); (1) pretreated BA used to replace 25% of the natural aggregate in asphalt concrete; (2) pre-treated BA used to replace 25% of the natural aggregate in cement concrete; (3) pre-treated BA used to replace 25% of cement in cement concrete; and (4) pre-treated BA sent to China, blended with municipal solid waste for landfill. The results reveal the following ranking of the scenarios: 3 > 2 > 0 > 1 > 4. Scenario 3 shows the best conditions for BA recycling, because the quantity of cement concrete output is the highest and this brings the greatest economic benefits. Our use of integrated analysis provides multi-aspect investigations for BA management systems, particularly in accounting for site-specific characteristics. This approach is suitable for application in other non-western regions.",2016

One such 'green' construction material is lime hemp concrete (LHC), hemp concrete or hempcrete, which are some of the many names of this novel construction material. Hemp concrete is essentially a composite made of lime and hemp shivs. This paper presents a literature review of the various studies carried out on hemp concrete to understand its properties, drawbacks and advantages in construction. The review dwells on discussion of hemp, use of lime as a binder material and the mechanical, thermal and hygric properties of LHC. The salient features of LHC with regard to mechanical, thermal and hygric properties and ecological impact are discussed in the paper.

The present paper describes the different families of inclusions that can be combined with cement matrix and reviews the achievements reported to date regarding mechanical performance, as well as two other innovative functionalities of growing importance: reducing the high carbon footprint of Portland cement, and obtaining new smart features. Nanomaterials stand out in the production of such advanced features, allowing the construction of smart or multi-functional structures by means of thermal- and strain-sensing, and photocatalytic properties. The first self-cleaning concretes (photocatalytic) have reached the markets. In this sense, it is expected that smart concretes will be commercialized to address specialized needs in construction and architecture. Conversely, other inclusions that enhance strength or reduce the environmental impact remain in the research stage, in spite of the promising results reported in these issues. Despite the fact that such functionalities are especially profitable in the case of massive cement consumption, the shift from the deeply established Portland cement to green cements still has to overcome economic, institutional, and technical barriers.",2016

The central concept of additive construction was defined, and a systematic mapping study was performed in order to assemble relevant publications selected according to a well-defined set of criteria. Knowledge gathered from the relevant publications was organised into four main categories: material science, engineering, building design and market analysis. The lack of focus of material science research towards the characterisation and potential improvement of construction-related material properties has been emphasised. The evolution of technological solutions to deposit the construction materials from gantry solutions to more lightweight systems has been described. The governing parameters for deciding on the most appropriate solutions have been identified as the type of building component, the location for production, and the assembly technique. Benefits of additive construction for building design were shown to mostly address the perspective of end-users, but should instead be understood as the emergence of new opportunities and new constraints that will necessitate a greater degree of rational decision-making in the design phase. The relevant markets for additive construction were shown to be closely related to the inherent specificities of the project in question. This implies that additive construction can be successfully applied in connection with general housing projects only if housing in general changes to become more optimised and more individualised. It was concluded that additive construction has the potential to revolutionise the construction industry, its success depending on how the whole building industry is ready to tackle three challenges: the need for an architectural paradigm shift, the need for a holistic design process, and the need for rational designs. A list of suggestions for further research is provided, among them the development of tools for assessing the disruptive potential of additive construction in an objective and scientific way.

Parabolic shells made from high-performance concrete for solar collectors,,CONCEPTUAL DESIGN; POWER-PLANTS; PROTOTYPE; SLABS,"Parabolic shells made from high-performance concrete for solar collectors Parabolic troughs for concentrating solar power plants are mainly built as spatial steel frameworks which support curved mirror elements pointwise. Today, significant cost savings can merely be expected from cheaper construction material as shown by a first prototype made from concrete [1]. Alternative concepts inspired by commercially established collector modules with an aperture width of about 6 m as well as large scale collector modules with an aperture width of up to 10 m have been developed within the priority program SPP 1542 Concrete light funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) in cooperation of the Technical University of Kaiserslautern and the Ruhr-University Bochum. These concepts also differ with respect to support conditions and cross-sectional shapes. They include single-walled solid shells with additional bracings according to the flux of forces or employ void formers and associated effective values for bending and axial stiffness. Of course, both fulfill the strict requirements set on lightweight and material efficient structures. Most relevant actions on the parabolic shells result from self-weight, wind loads and torsional moments due to the driving system, which are considered locally and globally to capture their influence on the shell's design.",2016
Laboratory study on recycling of sediments in paving blocks,"ports, docks & harbours; recycling & reuse of materials; strength & testing of materials",MARINE DREDGED SEDIMENTS; FIRED CLAY BRICKS; RIVER SEDIMENTS; CONCRETE; VALORIZATION; AGGREGATE,"The aim of this paper is to study the feasibility, in a laboratory experiment, of using dredged marine sediments as substituents of sand in paving blocks. Marine sediments recycled in this study are dredged from Rades harbour, which is considered as one of the most important harbours in Tunisia. This study reports a problem related to the large tonnage of marine sediments, which are considered as wastes. To optimise the circular economy, the recycling of these wastes in construction materials seems to present an interesting solution. This paper is composed of three main parts. The first part deals with the physical, chemical and environmental characterisation of marine sediments. The second part includes a research study on an optimal formulation of the use of marine sediments in paving blocks. In this article, we present the six formulations studied. Over 80 blocks were produced at laboratory scale. The last part is devoted to the analysis of normative test results conducted on specimens. It reveals that the substitution of 12.5% of sands by marine sediments provides paving blocks comparable to standard ones.",2016

A new method for proportioning recycled concrete,recycled concrete; concrete mix design; sustainability; concrete tests; recycling; construction material; building material,AGGREGATE CONCRETE,"A new modified mix proportioning method for producing normal-strength concrete using recycled concrete aggregate, called the equivalent coarse aggregate mass (ECAM) method, is proposed in this paper. The basic concepts of the proposed method with calculations for mix design are presented by designing 14 mixes and testing 99 concrete samples (57 cubes and 42 cylinders). Experimental work was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, an experimental programme was conducted to verify the proposed mix design method by studying a single parameter - uniaxial compressive strength. Five different mixes with initial 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % replacement by mass were designed, cast and tested in this phase. It was concluded from the first phase that the proposed method can be adopted for designing the recycled concrete up to a nominal replacement ratio of 50 %. Accordingly, the second phase of experimental study was carried out to design three different grades of concrete strength using the proposed method to investigate the mechanical properties of the recycled concrete. Seven different mechanical properties - compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, Schmidt hammer test, ultrasonic pulse velocity test, fresh density and hardened density - were investigated and are presented and discussed here.",2016
Case Study of the Core Structure Succeeding Method for Tall Building Construction,Core structure succeeding construction method; Core structure preceding construction method; Core structure construction; Tall building construction; Construction materials and method,MODEL,"In tall building construction, the adoption of the appropriate construction method for the core structure process is critical in terms of both the structural aspect of the building and the schedule estimation. This study introduces a new core structure succeeding construction method (CSSCM) for tall buildings with steel-reinforced concrete structures to address the obstacles of the existing core structure preceding construction method (CSPCM) such as limited workspace, interference between activities, difficulties in wall and slab joint construction, and similar obstacles. The study also shows the technical details and compares the results from the applications of CSPCM and CSSCM to an actual tall building project. The results revealed that this method has potential as a cost-effective construction method for structural frameworks of tall buildings where short cycle times are required. In addition, the method provided stable working environments for the steel erection including outriggers and core works.

This paper deals with development and structural performance of a few novel deconstructable TCC connections that can facilitate recycling and reusing of construction materials. The structural performance of 16 different sets of novel deconstructable TCC connections under shear loads is investigated by push-out tests followed by bending tests on nine TCC beams under service and ultimate loads.

The dredged soil samples were taken from the Ansung, Jechon, and Mulwang Reservoirs in Korea. To evaluate their environmental stability and geochemical properties, we examined their levels of heavy metal contamination, pH, and electrical conductivity. We also conducted X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction analyses. Furthermore, we determined the geotechnical characteristics, such as the compaction characteristics, and permeability coefficient, and we performed consolidated undrained triaxial compression tests to evaluate the recycling potential of dredged soil as embankment material. The concentrations of heavy metals in the sediment samples were lower than those of the standard samples. The pH value of the soil samples ranged from 4.25 to 5.39, and the electrical conductivity ranged between 83.3 and 265.0 mu S/cm, indicating suitability for use as construction material with steel and concrete. Based on the values of the mechanical properties of the dredged soil, analysis of slope stability was performed for various cases and water level conditions. Our results indicate that the dredged soil has sufficient stability for substitution of embankment material and also as new embankment material for expansion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Production of artificial stone slabs using waste granite and marble stone sludge samples,Waste Stone Sludge; Artificial Stone; Resource Recycling,SEWAGE-SLUDGE; CONCRETE; POWDER; ASH,"In this work, the waste stone sludge obtained from the granite and marble stone processing factories was used for the manufacture of artificial stones using vibratory compaction in a vacuum environment. The results obtained showed that water absorption and density increased, and the flexure, compressive, and tensile strengths decreased with increase in the content of the waste stone sludge. These results also demonstrated that by combining 50% of stone sludge, 12% of ground quartz, 25% of waste glass, and 13% of resin at a compaction pressure of 12 MPa, a vibration frequency of 30 Hz, and vacuum conditions at 50 mm Hg, artificial stone slabs with a water absorption less than 0.64, a density less than 2.68, a flexure strength more than 45 MPa, a compressive strength more than 90 MPa, and a tensile strength more than 35 MPa can be obtained. The artificial stone slabs obtained in this research work had good density and water absorption, and flexure, compressive, and tensile strengths compared to the natural stones, and thus they can be regarded as the ideal construction materials for covering walls or paving floors.",2016

Utilisation of wood ash from biomass for the production of ceramic products,Biomass; Wood ash; Recycling; Construction materials; Ceramic,SUGARCANE BAGASSE ASH; RAW-MATERIAL; BOTTOM ASH; FLY-ASH; WASTE; TEMPERATURE; CONCRETE,"Utilisation of biomass as fuel is very attractive from the ecological point of view. Such way of energy extraction is ecologically clean (zero CO2 emission) and biomass is renewable and theoretically inexhaustible local energy source. However, during the utilisation of secondary raw materials of biomass for energy production, higher amount of ash accumulates. Wood ash analysed in the research consists of two types of particles: first type - nonflammable mineral particles consisting of the following main elements: Si, Ca, Fe, O and C (86%) and the main elements of the particles of second type are C and 0 (98%). The aim of the research is to analyse the possibility to utilise wood ash from biomass for the production of ceramic products. Formation masses are prepared by incorporating from 5% to 60% of wood ash additive and burned at various temperatures. It is identified that this additive influences the properties of ceramic body, i.e. reduces drying and burning shrinkage, density, compressive strength, thermal conductivity, increases water absorption and porosity. Additive of wood ash from biomass influences the ceramic body as a natural pigment that brightens the ceramic body. Colour change is determined by sufficient amounts of calcium pyroxene in the composition thereof iron is inserted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

After appropriate pre treatments, MIBA can be used as fine or coarse aggregate in mortar, concrete and blocks. Full-scale operations have been undertaken with success, mainly in blocks: MIBA lightweight aggregate had similar properties to Lytag, though with marginally lower strength. Concrete containing MIBA lightweight aggregate achieved low density, high consistence properties, with strengths just below Lytag mixes. Replacing sand in foamed concrete, MIBA mixes satisfied the high flowability, low strength requirements. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Influence of class F fly ash and curing temperature on strength development of fly ash-recycled concrete aggregate blends,Fly ash; Recycled crushed concrete; Stabilization; Geotechnical,DEMOLITION WASTE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; HEAT-TREATMENT; CONSTRUCTION; CHINA; RESPONSES; BEHAVIOR; PAVEMENT; MODULUS,"The environmental footprint for Portland cement production contributes to significant carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in the civil engineering industry. Alternative low-carbon binders to Portland cement have been increasingly sought in recent years by road construction companies. Fly ash (FA) is the by-product of coal-fired electricity generation in many developed and developing countries, and is traditionally stockpiled as a waste material at power plants. Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) generated from demolition industries, has in recent years gained acceptance as cement stabilized pavement material. In this research, FA was evaluated as an alternative low-carbon binder for the stabilization of RCA as a road construction material. The substantial reduction in environmental impact of replacing general Portland cement by alternative binders such as FA, along with economic advantages of utilization of FA in construction activities tackles the negative landfilling impacts and carbon footprint of stabilization activities at the same time. The strength characterization of RCA stabilized with various FA content was evaluated by undertaking Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests on samples cured at ambient room temperature and at 40 degrees C. The durability of the FA stabilized RCA under simulated traffic loadings was furthermore evaluated by performing repeated load triaxial tests to determine the resilient modulus (M-R) of RCA samples when stabilized with FA. The micro-scale formation of bonds between the aggregates with different FA content and its effect on the strength of the stabilized RCA specimens was furthermore studied. RCA stabilized with 15% FA was found to be the optimum blend for road stabilization applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Investigation on the mechanical behavior of polyester-scrap tire composites,Scrap tires; Polyester; Rubber/polyester composites; Mechanical behavior,RUBBER; CONCRETE; POLYPROPYLENE; ASH; CONSTRUCTION; DESIGN; IMPACT,"An investigation of the mechanical properties of unsaturated polyester composites containing rubber waste particles is presented. The main objective of this work was to formulate and develop polyester-rubber composite as an insulating material with acceptable mechanical performance. To determine the effect of the rubber particles ratio on the compressive and tensile strengths and moduli of a polyester composite 8 different concentrations (i.e., 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35% and 40% by volume) were considered. The experimental results revealed that mixing rubber particles with the polyester matrix decreased both the compressive and tensile strengths and moduli of the composite. As the rubber content increases, and due to its low hydrophilicity towards polyester resin, the degree of crosslinking between the rubber particles and polyester is reduced causing a noticeable reduction in the composite strengths. On the other side for all investigated rubber contents, the larger the particle size of rubber, the lower the composites strength and modulus of elasticity. This is due to the difficulty of dispersion of the large particles into the matrix resulting non homogenous distribution of the particles and less interfacial contact with the matrix and in turn degradation in the mechanical behavior. However, smaller rubber particles have more specific surface area that could improve the interfacial contact with the polyester matrix. The SEM micrographs indicated that voids within the composite matrix increased with the content and size of rubber particles. Though adding rubber particles reduces the mechanical properties, the prepared composites demonstrate superior mechanical tensile strengths (22.8-1.25 MPa) and compressive strength (79.5-8.42 MPa) if compared with the currently used insulating materials and comparable to some construction materials like the stone masonry.

Sustainable design model to reduce environmental impact of building construction with composite structures,CO2 emissions; Embodied energy; Construction; Sustainable design; Composite structure,CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; OF-THE-ART; HONG-KONG; COST-ANALYSIS; CHINA; COLUMNS,"Thanks to advances in technologies related to zero energy buildings, reducing CO2 emissions during the design and construction phase becomes more and more important to reduce environmental impact from building construction. Even though more than half of high-rise buildings over 200 m completed in 2014 employed steel reinforced concrete (SRC) composite structures, most of sustainable design to reduce CO2 emissions were limited to reinforced concrete (RC) buildings. Since SRC is a composite structure consisting of three component materials of concrete, steel shape, and rebar, CO2 emissions can be effectively reduced by applying eco-friendly design strategies for determining the proportions of those components in SRC members. In this study, the sustainable design model for SRC composite structures is developed for optimal combination of construction materials with minimized CO2 emissions. The model is used to provide comprehensive analyses of variability of CO2 emissions in the building construction. The results indicates that increasing the cross-sectional area of steel shape is more advantageous for reduction of CO2 emissions than increasing the cross-sectional area of concrete for composite structures subjected to high axial loads required in high-rise building constructions based on the analysis of the contribution of each component to strength of column. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the environmental impact can be significantly reduced by using high strength materials in SRC structures. Further, through the application of the model to the design of an actual high-rise building, it is confirmed that derived SRC columns have excellent performances in terms of environmental impact and space utilization.

Evaluation of microstructural and microchemical aspects of high density concrete exposed to sustained elevated temperature,Concrete; Hematite; Strength,RAMAN-SPECTROSCOPY; EXPANDED VERMICULITE; HYDRATION; CEMENT; ETTRINGITE; HEMATITE; MODEL,"High density concrete is widely used as a primary material for radiation shielding due to numerous advantageous properties such as, strength, durability and ease of fabrication in comparison with other construction materials. As concrete is subjected even to high temperature environment in a nuclear reactor, the selection of concrete aggregates depends upon the exact application of the concrete. ACI limits the normal operating temperature in concrete structures to 65 degrees C in general and 90 degrees C locally, as exposure of concrete to high temperature induces complex changes in the moisture content as well as chemical composition of the cement paste and mismatch in thermal expansion leads to internal stresses and microcracking in the concrete constituents (aggregate and cement paste). Present research work is to investigate the suitability of concrete ingredients for producing high-performance high density concrete, of different densities using different types of aggregates (heamatite and steel shots) and studying the physicochemical changes in them due to a constant exposure at 120 degrees C as in a sodium cooled reactor. The results indicated heavy moisture loss in the first seven days of exposure and reduction in the mechanical properties, followed by increase in strength on continued exposure. Microstructure and morphological variations in thermally aged fractured specimens were used to explain the above variation in the mechanical properties. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Feasibility of Using Unbound Mixed Recycled Aggregates from CDW over Expansive Clay Subgrade in Unpaved Rural Roads,construction materials; mixed recycled aggregates; construction and demolition waste; expansive clays; unpaved rural roads,DEMOLITION WASTE; CONCRETE; CONSTRUCTION; CEMENT; SUBBASE; MORTAR,"Social awareness aims to increase practical skills, such as sustainable development, which seeks to increase the use of different types of waste in construction activities. Although insufficient attention is sometimes given to these actions, it is essential to spread information regarding new studies in the field of waste recycling, which encourages and promotes waste use. Reusing and recycling construction waste in the creation of buildings and infrastructure are fundamental strategies to achieving sustainability in the construction and engineering sectors. In this context, the concept of waste would no longer exist, as waste would become a material resource. Therefore, this study analyses the behaviours of two unbound mixed recycled aggregates (MRA) in the structural layers of an unpaved rural road with low traffic (category T43). The sections were built on inappropriate soil (A-7-6) with a high degree of free swelling. The experimental road consisted of three sections: the first was made with natural aggregates (NA) that were used as a control, the second was composed of MRA in the subbase and NA in the base, and the third section was completely composed of MRA. The materials were characterised in the laboratory. The behaviours of the structural layers in the experimental road were determined by controlling compaction (""in situ"" density and moisture) and measuring the deflections and load capacity (deflectometer) during the 18 months after construction. The results show that the sections made with recycled aggregates meet the technical specifications required by General Technical Specifications for Road and Bridge Works (PG-3). Therefore, the water-soluble sulphate content and Los Angeles abrasion coefficient limits can be increased for recycled aggregates without compromising the quality of this type of road with low traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the use of unbound MRA made from construction and demolition waste (CDW) in the construction of an unpaved rural road with low traffic on an expansive clay subgrade.",2016

The present paper describes the results of a research project, initiated in order to explore the potentiality and suitability of metakaolin-based geopolymers within the domain of cultural heritage. SEM-EDS analyses were utilized in order to evaluate the interaction of geopolymers with natural and artificial stones by assessing the variations at the boundaries due to differences in the minero-petrographic and chemical compositions of natural and artificial stones. Three ornamental stones widely used in the historic Italian architecture were selected: Pietra Serena (sandstone), Pietra di Angera (dolostone) and Pietra di Noto (limestone). Widespread construction materials, such as concrete and brick were also included in the study. Furthermore, the interaction between geopolymers and historic elements, such as decorative stones and/or mortars, were also studied, in order to evaluate a possible application of these materials within the realm of restoration, as well as for the conservation of historic manufactures. The results revealed that adhesion appears to be satisfactory in the case of all analyzed materials. Silicoaluminate phases partially dissolve and increase the availability of Si and Al within the interface, resulting in a strongly interlinked whole, whereas carbonate phases and rocks supply Ca, which changes the local composition of the binder.",2016
Longterm-behavior of glued full-scale specimens made from wood and high performance concrete at natural climate conditions,timber-concrete composite; adhesive bond; long-term behavior; natural climate conditions; creep; swelling; shrinkage; temperature,,"The advantages of the construction materials wood and concrete could be used effectively in wood-concrete-composite constructions. The composite structure shows optimized load carrying capacity, a better vibrational behavior, higher noise protection and a higher thermally activatable mass in comparison to constructions that are entirely made from wood. Mechanical fasteners or form fitting connections are state-of-the-art for connecting timber to concrete. This leads to more or less flexible bond. By using the adhesive technology a rigid bond can be achieved and it is possible to combine the advantages of a dry construction method with the advantages of the prefabrication. The questions of the production technology and the short-term behavior of glued wood-concrete composite constructions were answered yet at the department of timber structures at the University of Kassel.

Additionally, the non-biodegradable nature of these wastes further increases severity of the problem. The shortage of land to accommodate the waste landfills, increased transportation cost and other associated problems have forced industries to search for other viable alternatives. Moreover, over-exploitation of natural resources by the construction industry has led to their depletion. Thus, the construction industry is compelled to look for other economic and sustainable substitutes for conventional raw materials (river sand, natural aggregates) and cement. Past studies suggest that waste of discarded rubber tyres, silica fume, glass, slag, pond ash, bottom ash, metakaolin, stone etc. can effectively replace a part or the whole of conventional materials used for concreting. Recycling of these wastes as construction material can be a sustainable practice. However, the green concrete so produced needs to satisfy certain parameters for its applicability. In recent years, studies have claimed that waste from dimensional stone industry can be effectively recycled into concrete, a practice certainly benefiting the stone as well as construction industries. This paper reviews the applicability of dimensional stone waste in concrete. The effect of stone waste substitution on workability, strength and durability parameters such as permeability, chloride migration, porosity, water absorption, carbonation, acid and sulphate resistance have been reviewed in the paper. It is suggested to investigate in-detail the durability of concrete containing dimensional stone waste to establish the same as popular construction material. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Clay-based SW waste induced a greater decline in the heat production rate, temperature rise and total heat than CDW waste. Moreover, the downslopes steepened with increasing replacement ratios. A linear relationship was observed between the values for total heat of hydration found with the two test methods. The type of waste, replacement ratio and the interaction between these two parameters had a significant impact on heat of hydration.",2016

The coarse aggregate used in this study was a waste lightweight aerated block. The experimental series consisted of 2 parts. Part 1 was the investigation on PCM impregnation technique using heat and pressure. This part investigated the effect of temperature and pressure on PCM impregnation level to determine the optimum temperature and pressure. Part 2 was the study on the properties of geopolymers containing non-PCM and PCM aggregates. The density, compressive strength and thermal storage of geopolymers were tested. Results showed that the density of geopolymer increased with the increasing PCM aggregate content. The increase in density also led to the improvement of compressive strength. The incorporation of PCM aggregate also improved the thermal storage and heat insulation of geopolymer panel. With a high level of impregnation of 65 %, the heat insulation improved significantly as indicated by the delay of time needed to reach the peak temperature. The thermal storage was also improved as reflected by the ability of panel to maintain high temperature after the end of heating. Since geopolymer is considered a green construction material, this material is thus green and sustainable in terms of energy saving.",2016
"CHARACTERISATION OF NATURAL POZZOLAN OF ""DJOUNGO"" (CAMEROON) AS LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE FOR LIGTWEIGHT CONCRETE",Characterisation; Natural Pozzolan; Lightweight Aggregate and Concrete,,"Cameroon has an appreciable quantity of volcanic pozzolanic materials, but a very low proportion is used as cement additions. These materials are abundant but are rarely or very little used because of the lack or limited of studies to develop, promote and popularize its use naturally as an addition or as aggregates in the production lightweights aggregates concretes. The main objective of this study is to promote these sources of low environmental impact construction materials. Its aim is to characterize and value the natural pozzolan source ""Djoungo"" as lightweight aggregate for lightweight concrete. Analyses and tests conducted in this study were performed on aggregates produced from this resource. It's concern the chemical and mineralogical analysis, the production of aggregates (Crushing and Sieving), physical properties (appearance and shape, natural water content, porosity, density and water absorption) and mechanical (Compressive strength, tensile strength and elastic modulus) to optimize the mechanical properties and durability of lightweight aggregate concrete obtained from this resource. Chemical composition is according with ACI (American Concrete Institute) standard on natural pozzolans. Two categories of lightweight aggregates were obtained. Those derived by simply sieving have more than 82% of rolled particles and those obtained after crushing have more than 84% of flatter and elongate particles. The bulk density is ranging around 560-820 kg/m(3) and specific density around 1,580-2,730 kg/m(3). The water absorption after 48 hours is around 12 to 28% and depending of grading class.",2016

These eco-aggregates, obtained by mixing industrial by-products or wastes such as ashes with carbon dioxide (CO2), have some characteristics which make them useful in the field of construction materials such as natural aggregates replacement in concrete or mortar. Hygric and thermal characterizations were performed on carbonated aggregates with adapted methods. The results have been compared to that obtained with two reference aggregates: natural gravel and expanded clay. Then thermal and hygric behaviors of concretes-based on carbonated aggregates were analyzed and discussed in the field of construction. These results proved that carbonated aggregates can be valorized through the manufacturing of concrete building blocks with several advantages: mechanical strength, thermal and hygric inertias. Experimental properties allowed a numerical/digital simulation in dynamic conditions for a simple and multilayered wall using the SPARK object-oriented simulation environment that is adapted to complex problems. Their performances were compared to those of concretes based on two reference aggregates in order to highlight the feasibility of manufacturing building blocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

After the CPB is placed in the field, the evolution of its mechanical and thermal properties strongly affects its stability and the heat transfer within it. An experimental setup is designed to enable the curing of CPB samples under different stresses, filling rates, initial temperatures and drainage conditions as well as the monitoring of the changes in capillary pressure, temperature, amount of drained water and electrical conductivity in the CPB samples during curing. Furthermore, extensive testing is carried to investigate the combined effects of initial temperature, curing stress and drainage on the mechanical, microstructural and thermal properties of CPB. The obtained results reveal that these properties are strongly influenced by the initial backfill temperature, curing stress and drainage conditions, and their interactions. These can significantly affect the cement hydration, capillary pressure development and pore structure of CPB. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Carbon dioxide upcycling into industrially produced concrete blocks,Concrete; Carbon dioxide; Masonry blocks; Carbonation,,A novel carbon utilization trial produced carbon dioxide treated concrete blocks by adding carbon dioxide gas to the concrete during the mixing and forming stages of the block production. The gas was supplied at up to 1.5% by weight of cement. The carbon dioxide was absorbed into the concrete with an average efficiency of about 88% of the gas delivered. The carbon dioxide was shown to reduce the block compaction (and thereby the density) but increasing the mix water was an effective countermeasure. The carbonation process was shown to increase compressive strength (13-33% at ages from 7 to 56 days) and decrease absorption (by 18-36%). The CO2 upcycling reduced the carbon footprint of the blocks by 1.4% thereby demonstrating a simple approach to utilizing carbon dioxide to make useful construction materials. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Long term permeation properties of different fly ash geopolymer concretes,Geopolymer; Water absorption; Permeability; Chloride diffusion; Durability,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; RESISTANCE; CORROSION; PERMEABILITY; PENETRATION; EMISSIONS; EXPOSURE; MORTARS; ACID,"Geopolymer is a sustainable construction material produced by the activation of fly ash using a high concentration alkali to initiate a polymerisation reaction. A key parameter in determining the potential adoption of geopolymer concrete in the construction industry is the long term durability of the material. To determine the durability characteristics a detailed investigation of the permeation properties of four different fly ash geopolymer concretes was carried out up to one year of age. An improvement in the durability properties is observed for all geopolymer concretes with time. This is attributed to an ongoing geopolymerization which results in continuing gel formation leading to a more densely packed microstructure, with an associated reduction in meso-pores and macro-pores. The packing density coupled, with the pore size distribution, were observed to determine the permeation and diffusion characteristics of the concrete. The increased in meso-pores represents the increase in the gel of the matrix and in turn this affect the increase of water absorption. On the other hand, a high quantity of macro-pores leads to an increase in the water and air permeability of geopolymer concrete. A large quantity of coarse particles in fly ash results in an uneven gel distribution which reduces pore-filling ability, while the presence of a high quantity of CaO was observed to contribute to a densely packed microstructure. Notably the initial chloride diffusion coefficients are analogous to those observed in Portland and blended cement concretes and also decrease with the age in a similar manher. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

NMR and MRI observation of water absorption/uptake in hemp shives used for hemp concrete,Hemp concrete; Imbibition; NMR; MRI,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYESTER COMPOSITES; HURDS COMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR; RELAXATION; FIBERS,"Hemp concrete used as a construction material is known to provide excellent thermal insulation and hydric regulation, and prevents condensation. Initial water content in the hemp and water exchanges between hemp and binder play a major role in these processes. Here we study how hemp absorbs liquid water. In that aim we rely on H-1 NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) measurements which make it possible to distinguish water situated inside from water situated outside the hemp. Then, following the evolution of the distribution of NMR relaxation times we are able to quantify the effective amount of water entering the hemp as a function of time. We show that such a measure is better controlled than usual techniques such as weighing an immersed sample or the TC (Technical Committee) RILEM (Reunion Internationale des Laboratoires et Experts des Materiaux, systemes de construction et ouvrages) method which cannot easily distinguish water inside hemp from water situated outside or wetting the external hemp surface. The water absorption in hemp occurs in two steps: about half the water enters the material in a time of the order of a minute, while the second half of water slowly penetrates over a time of the order of three days. Finally, from H-1 micro NMR imaging we show that the first step corresponds to water entering the pith while the second one corresponds to water diffusing in the wood part of the shiv.

"Assessment of distilled lavender stalks as bioaggregate for building materials: Hygrothermal properties, mechanical performance and chemical interactions with mineral pozzolanic binder",Lavender straw; Bioaggregate; Pozzolanic binder; Chemical interaction; Hardening mechanism,FIBER-REINFORCED CEMENT; THERMAL-PROPERTIES; LIGHTWEIGHT CONCRETE; EARLY AGES; WOOD; HYDRATION; COMPOSITES; LIME; CLAY; STRENGTH,"The building construction sector has a major impact on sustainable development, mainly in terms of raw material use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste production. Studies on alternative materials are nowadays clearly a priority to improve energy consumption and optimize waste management. Bio-based construction materials could take up this environmental challenge. Bio-based aggregates are renewable, they are mainly produced locally and they constitute an important way to store carbon dioxide. Most of the time, these bio-based aggregates are sub-products from local industries located near the factories producing building materials. Their use thus contributes largely to a decrease in the waste produced. Moreover, many studies have underlined the very interesting hygrothermal properties of bio-based materials, although some interactions of the bioaggregates with their surrounding environment have to be considered. Various authors have shown that cement (e.g. Portland cement), used as a mineral binder sometimes presents compatibility problems with bio-based aggregates, which can impact the setting and hardening processes of the binder. Among the several bioaggregates that can be considered, the waste derived from the production of essential oils is becoming an important issue. Essential oils are increasingly used in industrial countries today, mainly in medicinal or beauty products for their aromatic, medicinal and biological properties. These oils are primarily obtained by distillation of aromatic and medicinal plants. The effectiveness of these industrial and traditional transformations is very low, about 1% by mass, and this leads to large amounts of solid and liquid waste. The processing of these waste materials is inexistent in some countries like France, so waste constitutes a real obstacle to the development of this industrial sector. The objectives of this work are to determine the physical characteristics of a specific aromatic and medicinal plant residue (lavender straw) and the performances of a composite including this straw in the form of bioaggregates within a pozzolanic matrix previously designed by combining metakaolin with slaked lime. The characterization of lavender aggregates was conducted through Scanning Electron Microscope observations and their bulk density, water absorption capacity, bulk thermal conductivity and particle size distribution were assessed by an image analysis method. The thermal conductivity, water vapour permeability, moisture buffer value and mechanical properties of the composite were assessed. Finally, a study was conducted in order to understand the impact of lavender aggregates on the hydration mechanisms of the pozzolanic binder. Model pastes were elaborated with a solution obtained by soaking lavender particles in demineralized water for 72 h and then filtering. The properties of the pastes were compared with those of neat pozzolanic paste. The setting time, hardening mechanisms (followed by X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis) and mechanical performance of the pozzolanic matrix were clearly influenced by the lavender extractives.

To use energy efficiently without any reduction in production, comfort and work power; energy saving is needed. Energy efficiency of buildings is primarily necessary in order to save costs and also reduce the amount of CO2 emission and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In recent years, thermal insulation with different originated materials has been studied. In order to maximize energy saving, more attention should be paid for the selection of appropriate construction materials which can be utilised for insulation. In this experimental study, cement mortars with different fine aggregates were prepared and compared by means of physical, mechanical and thermal properties. The results showed that acidic pumice aggregate mortar had higher capillar absorption and lower thermal conductivity than the basic pumice aggregate mortar. It is also found that mortars with porous slag had the lowest strength values and the highest permeability. However, they exhibited the best performance among other mortars in thermal properties.

Adhesive-bonded timber-concrete composites - Experimental and numerical investigation of hygrothermal effects,Timber-concrete composites; Adhesive; Creep; Moisture; Climate; Shrinkage; Long-term behavior,LONG-TERM; WOOD; MODEL; BEAM,"The advantages of the two different building construction materials timber and concrete could be used effectively in timber-concrete composite constructions. The composite structure shows optimized load carrying capacity, better dynamic behavior, higher noise protection and higher thermally activatable mass in comparison to constructions that are entirely made from wood. So far, the bond between wood and concrete is usually provided by mechanical fasteners or formfitting connections. Mechanical fasteners lead to a more or less flexible connection. In the case of formfitting connections, the behavior depends on the geometry of the contact area. A ""rigid bond"" can be achieved by using adhesive technology and it is possible to combine the advantages of a ""dry construction method"" with those of prefabrication. The questions of the production technology and the short-term behavior of glued wood-concrete composite constructions were answered in previous research projects at the Department of Timber Structures and Building Rehabilitation at the University of Kassel. However, knowledge of long-term behavior for an application in construction practice was missing. This has been studied in detail in the last three years in the research project ""BestKleb"", funded by the German Federation of Industrial Research Associations AiF. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Actual situation of construction materials management in Costa Rica,Composition; quantity; construction waste; causes,WASTE,"The construction industry is considered a pillar in the economy of nations. It provides housing, buildings and infrastructure for a growing population and continued urbanization, especially in developing countries. However, this sector is known as a major consumer of natural resources producing a significant amount of construction and demolition waste. The data, on the situation of construction waste generation is scarce in Costa Rica. Therefore, the aim of the study is to develop a baseline on the quantities and composition of the waste generated during the construction process, as well as the motivators and barriers to achieve a more sustainable activity. In order to achieve the objective, a survey was done by means of a questionnaire and interviews including construction site visits. According to the results, construction waste is composed of wood, soil, rest of piping materials, corrugated sheet, metal wires, packaging materials (paper, plastic, cardboard), cement, concrete, cement blocks, paints and debris. The quantities, either by volume or weight are unknown due to the lack of records kept by the companies. An indicator related to construction waste generation was determined as 100 kg/m2. This value is high compared to the ones reported in literature for developed countries which could be explained as due to the lack of knowledge on technologies and information on the environmental impact of their activities by the construction companies, the absence of enforcement procedures, and market incentives for a more sustainable activity.",2016

Copper slags studied were chemically classified as acidic slags, this slags presented higher SiO2 content (38-49%) than Fe2O3 (18-37%) and a significant amount of CaO (8-26%) and Al2O3 (8.5%). Mineralogy and structure was varied, presenting one of them an amorphous structure and the remaining three, a crystalline structure with partially amorphous character. The majority mineral phases presented in the copper slag were diopside, fayalite, magnetite, cristobalite and clinoferrosilita. Calcium levels indicate that the slags could have cementitious properties for use as a binder in construction materials. Moreover, the significant amount of slag available and CuO content (0.6-1.2%) show that may be of interest as raw material for metal recovery.",2016

Due to the presence of cement mortar component, RCA has a lower unit weight than that of typical soils, thus its use may be considered beneficial in engineering infrastructures with a demand in the reduction of settlements or lateral earth pressures. In this study, a set of torsional resonant column and bender element tests were carried out on uniform fractions of a recycled concrete aggregate with origin from New South Wales, Australia, with varying the mean grain size. The created in the laboratory samples, were prepared in a dry state and tested under isotropic conditions of the confinement varying the effective confining stress from 25 to 800 kPa in a resonant column and in a triaxial apparatus with embedded piezo-element inserts with a particular focus on the elastic stiffness G(max). The results showed that the sensitivity of G(max) to pressure increased with decreasing mean grain size. This observed trend was attributed, partly, to the higher cement mortar component for fractions with a smaller grain size. The different composition of the fractions was verified through Scanning Electron Microscope - Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) analysis in particular quantifying the ratio of Silicon over Calcium contents. The performance of expressions proposed in the literature for the prediction of G(max) of sands and gravels, was rigorously evaluated by means of measured against predicted elastic stiffness for all the fractions as well as by means of the state parameter for a particular RCA fraction.

However, UHPC requires high amount of energy intensive materials including cement, which could cause unfavorable environmental impact compared to normal concrete. Various eco-friendly UHPC mix designs are proposed by incorporating industrial slags and limestone powder in order to decrease environmental overload and enhance flowability concurrently. Particle packing analysis is carried out for mixture proportioning of the UHPC mixes using different solid constituents. Two types of industrial slags, ground granulated blast-furnace slag and rapid-cooling EAF oxidizing slag are effectively substituted cement and natural fine aggregates in UHPC, respectively. Flowability of UHPC is quantified using flow test and two V-funnel apparatus with different size. Sustainability potential of the suggested UHPC mixtures adopting various low energy intensive materials is characterized by comparing crucial environmental impact categories. Synergistic effects in flowability and ecological aspects can be achieved when two forms of industrial slags used together. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

"Leaching of chloride, sulphate, heavy metals, dissolved organic carbon and phenolic organic pesticides from contaminated concrete",C&D waste; Solid waste; Pesticides; Leaching; Recycling; Concrete,WASTE; CONSTRUCTION; AGGREGATE; STANDARD; COLUMN,"Concrete samples from demolition waste of a former pesticide plant in Sweden were analysed for total contents and leachate concentrations of potentially hazardous inorganic substances, TOC, phenols, as well as for pesticide compounds such as phenoxy acids, chlorophenols and chlorocresols. Leachates were produced by means of modified standard column leaching tests and pH-stat batch tests. Due to elevated contents of chromium and lead, as well as due to high chloride concentrations in the first leachate from column tests at L/S 0.1, recycling of the concrete as a construction material in groundworks is likely to be restricted according to Swedish guidelines. The studied pesticide compounds appear to be relatively mobile at the Materials own pH > 12, 12, 9 and 7. Potential leaching of pesticide residues from recycled concrete to ground water and surface water might exceed water quality guidelines for the remediation site and the EU Water Framework Directive. Results of this study stress the necessity to systematically study the mechanism behind mobility of organic contaminants from alkaline construction and demolition wastes rather than rely on total content limit values.

Both types of ash were characterized by obtaining their chemical and mineralogical composition, their organic matter content, granulometry, adsorption and other common tests for construction materials. Seven different mortars were fabricated, one for reference made up of cement, sand, and water, three in which 10, 20, or 30% of the cement was replaced by biomass ash, and three others in which 10, 20, or 30% of the cement was replaced with dregs. Test specimens were fabricated with these mortars to conduct flexural and compression tests. Flexural strength is reduced for all the mortars studied. Compressive strength increases for the mortars fabricated with biomass ash and decreases for the mortar with dregs. Finally, 5 concretes were made, one of them as a reference (neither biomass ash nor dregs added), two of them with replacements of 10 and 20% of biomass ash instead of cement and another two with replacements of 10 and 20% of dregs instead of cement. The compressive and tensile splitting strength increase when a 10% of ash is replaced and decrease in all the other cases. The modulus of elasticity always decreases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Material development for a sustainable precast concrete block pavement,Rubberized concrete; Crumb rubber; Damage mechanism; Material characterization; Impact energy,,"Portland cement concrete (PCC) and asphalt concrete (AC) are the most common roadway and highway construction materials which are more suitable for continuous slab pavements. The durability of these materials is highly dependent on construction quality and techniques, and both materials are difficult to repair. Heavy rain storms in India have recently revealed several roadway pavement failures and resulted in significant repair costs. Interlocking block type pavements are simpler to construct and maintain than both PCC and AC pavements but, have only been used for slower traffic roads due to weak interlocking at the joints. To improve the quality of block pavements, blocks made of PCC with waste tire crumb rubber partially replacing river sand (fine aggregate) are suggested. The joint interlocks can be further improved by modifying the block geometry. The material is completely recycled and is deemed more superior than concrete pavements when repair and construction techniques and costs are concerned.

To assess the acoustic absorption of hemp-lime walls, as they are commonly finished in practical construction, wall sections are rendered and the resulting impact on absorption is evaluated. Hemp-concretes with lime-pozzolan binders display superior acoustic properties relative to more hydraulic binders. These are diminished when rendered, as the open surface porosity is affected, however hemp-lime construction offers the potential to meet standard and guideline targets for spaces requiring acoustic treatment.

The first objective of this paper was to compare the durability of distinctively old and new construction materials and technologies used in the vernacular houses in a context of northern Iran. The second objective was to search implicit values behind making decisions regarding durability. The 'old' construction technologies were 'Kali', Mud Houses, and Lar deh ee"", and, while Load-bearing wall, Concrete, and Steel structure were the 'new' categories. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 167 residents of different vernacular houses and 18 of them were selected for interview. Besides, a number of 20 experts also participated in a mailing survey for validating the data. Perception of users on durability of structure was assessed and compared through 5 elements namely foundation, floor, wall, roof, and attachment through the structured-questionnaire, while the implicit values were revealed from data collected through the open-ended interview. Results showed that residents tend to rate the old houses higher, rather controversially. Commercialization might be gradually inclining users' choices towards new houses, but responses also showed that a house is likely to be redundant after only a couple of generations, even though it still has a long durable lifetime to spare, thus making the durability issue less significant.",2016

The results show that geopolymers based on blast furnace slag has a behavior similar to hydration maturity of Portland cement and curing process decreases the porosity; On the other hand, applying a controlled temperature generates densest resistant pastes such as the variable CT45-C which reach the highest value of resistance in all curing ages.",2016

For the selection of the source materials, special emphasis was placed on the ready availability at low cost. The rheological properties of the fresh mortar allow an easy workability by hand while the hardened mortar shows a durable and tight appearance at the same time. The developed material can be used as a coating for walls, floors and ceilings of cisterns, for the local rehabilitation of damaged areas only or even as a construction material for complete new cisterns. The future multiplication of the IWRM project results within the region was assured by a local capacity development when the presented material concept was applied in practise in Indonesia for the construction of sustainable rain water cisterns in Gunung Kidul.",2016
Application of bioenzymatic soil stabilization in comparison to macadam in the construction of transport infrastructure,Environment friendly; Macadam; Soil stabilization; Terra Zyme; Transport infrastructure,,"Over ninety percent of roads and highways are paved with asphalt as it is less expensive, flexible and easy to construct and repair in comparison to concrete. The increasing effect of climatic change and cost of construction materials have forced to consider environment friendly methods to build roads. One economically feasible solution for achieving these objectives is use of enzyme soil stabilization. Use of bioenzymes is known to improve the stability of aggregates and soil materials in the roadways and other pavement structures. The present study was designed to introduce environment friendly TerraZyme to increase engineering qualities of soil for road construction. Soil classification and earth work characteristics were analyzed for two soil types representing pulverized local and transported soil with and without TerraZyme. Obtained results confirmed that treatment with TerraZyme increased engineering characteristics as indicated by increase in CBR values from 10.47 to 16.28 with 55 % improvement, increase of 4.28 % and 2.20 in dry density and decrease of 18.13 % and 6.17 % in moisture content for untreated and treated soils, respectively. TerraZyme constructed roads will be effective for cost saving upto 15-20 % and maintenance cost reduction of 60 % as compared to normal water bound Macadam road.",2016
Deformation Behavior of Recycled Concrete Aggregate during Cyclic and Dynamic Loading Laboratory Tests,recycled concrete aggregate; cyclic loading; plastic strain; fatigue; resilient modulus,SHAKEDOWN THEORY; CONSTRUCTION; STRENGTH; FATIGUE; SOILS; SAND,"Recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is a relatively new construction material, whose applications can replace natural aggregates. To do so, extensive studies on its mechanical behavior and deformation characteristics are still necessary. RCA is currently used as a subbase material in the construction of roads, which are subject to high settlements due to traffic loading. The deformation characteristics of RCA must, therefore, be established to find the possible fatigue and damage behavior for this new material. In this article, a series of triaxial cyclic loading and resonant column tests is used to characterize fatigue in RCA as a function of applied deviator stress after long-term cyclic loading. A description of the shakedown phenomenon occurring in the RCA and calculations of its resilient modulus (Mr) as a function of fatigue are also presented. Test result analysis with the stress-life method on the Wohler S-N diagram shows the RCA behavior in accordance with the Basquin law.",2016

This study proposes a natureinspired metaheuristic regression system that can find appropriate solutions. The system uses a graphical user interface but does not require a mathematical program installation. The user-friendly interface was designed in the MATLAB graphical user interface design environment (GUIDE) and was implemented by MATLAB compiler. The stand-alone system is easy to use and has many functions, including evaluation, use of an opened data file, test set selection, hold-out, cross validation, and prediction to solve many civil engineering problems with simple manipulations on the system interface. Five benchmark functions were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the optimization module. The performance of the proposed regression system was then validated by comparing its solutions obtained for civil engineering problems with those obtained by empirical methods reported previously. Five actual data sets including energy-efficient buildings, construction material strength, concrete structure shear strength, bridge scour depth, and subbase soil modulus were used as case studies. The prediction accuracy was 8.24-91.76% better than those of previously reported models. The analytical results support the feasibility of using the proposed system to solve numerous civil engineering problems. The system was also much faster at identifying the optimum parameters and solving problems. The experiments confirmed that the novel nature-inspired metaheuristic regression system proposed in this study has superior efficiency, effectiveness, and accuracy.

There is an increasing demand for environmental protection, as well as materials with a high strength/density ratio. The manufactured sand (MS) and lightweight sand (LS) as fine aggregates in cement-based composite materials have been receiving more attention among researchers. However, there is not much information about the effects of MS and LS on the properties of the fresh and hardened SCLCs. In this paper, the properties of fresh and hardened SCLC made with MS and LS were investigated by a series of experiments. SCLCs made with RS served as the control in this study. The test results show that increasing the sand ratio (from 0.40-0.50) decreased the filling ability and led to an increased T-50 time, which is the time spent for the concrete to reach the 500 mm spread circle, for all of the fresh SCLCs. Although the passing ability of MS-SCLCs and LS-SCLCs is not as good as RS-SCLCs, their results are still within an acceptable range. The ratio of mechanical properties to density was found to increase with an increase of the sand ratio for all of the hardened SCLCs. MS-SCLCs presented the highest compressive strength among all of the SCLCs studied. Although the mean compressive strength of LS-SCLCs is lower than those of the other two SCLCs by 8%, their strength to density ratio is higher than others by 15%, and the ratio increases remarkably with the increase of the sand ratio. Permeability test results showed that the permeability coefficient of MS-SCLC is remarkably lower than that of LS-SCLC, but slightly higher than that of RS-SCLC.",2016

The successful production of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) depends on its material ingredients and mixture proportioning, which leads to denser and relatively more homogenous particle packing. A database was compiled from various research and field studies around the world on the mechanical and durability performance of UHPC. It is shown that UHPC provides a viable and long-term solution for improved sustainable construction owing to its ultra-high strength properties, improved fatigue behavior and very low porosity, leading to excellent resistance against aggressive environments. The literature review revealed that the curing regimes and fiber dosage are the main factors that control the mechanical and durability properties of UHPC. Currently, the applications of UHPC in construction are very limited due to its higher initial cost, lack of contractor experience and the absence of widely accepted design provisions. However, sustained research progress in producing UHPC using locally available materials under normal curing conditions should reduce its material cost. Current challenges regarding the implementation of UHPC in full-scale structures are highlighted. This study strives to assist engineers, consultants, contractors and other construction industry stakeholders to better understand the unique characteristics and capabilities of UHPC, which should demystify this resilient and sustainable construction material.",2016
CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL MOUNTABLE UHF RFID TAG ANTENNA,antenna; radio frequency identification; sensors; concrete; metal,FREQUENCY,"This article presents a tag antenna for radio frequency identification (RFID)-based wireless structural health monitoring systems. An ultra-high frequency (UHF) microstrip patch tag antenna is designed with a new generation RFID tag chip for the Australian UHF RFID frequency band. Simulation studies with optimized slits demonstrate the ability of the antenna to tolerate the influence of construction materials such as concrete and metal on its resonant frequency, maximum gain, and read range. Noncontact measurement of the resonant frequency and experimental verification of the maximum gain of the fabricated tag antenna show good agreement with simulated performance. Read range measurements are conducted to verify the performance of the tag antenna on metal structures. It is also shown that the proposed tag antenna can be easily modified to operate in other UHF RFID frequency bands. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016
A novel material for in situ construction on Mars: experiments and numerical simulations,Martian Concrete; Sulfur concrete; Waterless concrete; Space construction; Compression; Bending; Lattice Discrete Particle Model; Particle size distribution; High strength,SHEAR LATTICE MODEL; CONCRETE DAMAGE; SULFUR CONCRETE; COMPRESSION; TENSION,"A significant step in space exploration during the 21st century will be human settlement on Mars. Instead of transporting all the construction materials from Earth to the red planet with incredibly high cost, using Martian soil to construct a site on Mars is a superior choice. Knowing that Mars has long been considered a ""sulfur-rich planet"", a new construction material composed of simulated Martian soil and molten sulfur is developed. In addition to the raw material availability for producing sulfur concrete and a strength reaching similar or higher levels of conventional cementitious concrete, fast curing, low temperature sustainability, acid and salt environment resistance, 100% recyclability are appealing superior characteristics of the developed Martian Concrete. In this study, different percentages of sulfur are investigated to obtain the optimal mixing proportions. Three point bending, unconfined compression and splitting tests were conducted to determine strength development, strength variability, and failure mechanisms. The test results show that the strength of Martian Concrete doubles that of sulfur concrete utilizing regular sand. It is also shown that the particle size distribution plays an important role in the mixture's final strength. Furthermore, since Martian soil is metal rich, sulfates and, potentially, polysulfates are also formed during high temperature mixing, which might contribute to the high strength. The optimal mix developed as Martian Concrete has an unconfined compressive strength of above 50 MPa. The formulated Martian Concrete is simulated by the Lattice Discrete Particle Model (LDPM), which exhibits excellent ability in modeling the material response under various loading conditions.

The PCF, based on BaTiO3 and reduced graphene oxide was prepared using one step hydrothermal process. It was reinforced in cement matrix in differing quantities to obtain 5%, 10% and 20% PCF by weight mixtures (dry). Various characterization techniques including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and IN-visible spectrophotometer were employed to affirm the morphology, composition and photocatalytic performance of cement and PCF composites. High reaction rate constant of 0.0080 min(-1), 0.0013 min(-1) and 0.0015 min(-1) could be achieved for pellets with 5%, 10% and 20% photocatalytic filler, respectively. Experimental investigations clearly exhibited that incorporation of PCF could readily impart ameliorated photocatalytic activity in such cement composites. Results revealed that dye degradation is function of PCF composite density on the effective surface area of the composites. The impact of incorporation of PCF on physical properties of cement has been discusses as well. In addition, the work presents a comparative analysis of the significant attempts that have been made in the same direction. The proposed approach offers an economic and feasible construction material which could greatly expedite the development and commercialization of functional photoactive buildings.

Properties of cementitious mortar and concrete containing micro-encapsulated phase change materials,Cement-based materials; Phase change materials; Heat capacity; Calorimetry; Thermogravimetry; Compressive strength,HYDRATION PROCESS; STRENGTH,"More efficient energy usage in buildings with increased thermal mass and better thermal insulation has attracted considerable attention in recent years. As one the most widely used construction materials in the building industry, concrete has a great potential to be converted to a high performance thermal storage material by using phase change materials (PCMs). To demonstrate this, mortar and concrete mixes were blended with microencapsulated PCM as part replacement of fine aggregates and assessed for improved thermal performance. Specimens with varying amount of microencapsulated PCM were tested using calorimetry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetry (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), compressive strength and thermal conductivity. Results show that high specific surface of microencapsulated PCM particles has induced an acceleration of the cement hydration. However, the compressive strength at 28 days is still decreased when fine aggregates were substituted by PCM. Contrary to past observations, microencapsulated PCM is observed to remain intact in the cementitious matrices and contributed significantly to improve the heat capacity as well as to reduce the thermal conductivity of the mixes tested. A blend with 20%v/v replacement was identified as the optimum PCM replacement. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

Towards the Establishment of a Continuous Nondestructive Monitoring Technique for Fresh Concrete,Concrete; Fresh; Water content; Aggregate content; RA; Average frequency; Acoustic emission; Ultrasonic pulse velocity,CEMENT-BASED MATERIALS; ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; CLASSIFICATION; MECHANISMS; CRACKING; MORTAR; NDE,"Despite the fact that concrete is the most widely used construction material, conventional techniques for the estimation of the mechanical properties are only applicable to the hardened material. Moreover, concerning the fresh concrete examination, the already existing techniques provide only qualitative information, are not representative over the full time period of curing, setting and hardening or have limited accuracy and repeatability. In this study, the acoustic emission (AE) technique is employed in order to investigate the activity within fresh concrete as early as a few minutes after mixing. Several processes like settlement, segregation, formation and migration of air bubbles, as well as formation of hydrates produce AEs which so far have not been properly examined in literature. The first and foremost goal is to check the capacity of the new AE setup to record emissions earlier than previous studies (just after casting). The next goal concerns the possibility to characterize the different types of emissions relatively to their original source mechanism while the final goal would be the investigation of possible correlations between the early age acoustic activity and the final mechanical properties. For this reason, an AE setup is applied utilizing the favorable wave transmission properties of the metal casting molds, which act as a sort of waveguide. After validating its sensitivity, several laboratory tests are performed in concrete with varying water and aggregate content. It is found that the rate of AE activity follows trends similar to the typical hydration curves known from literature and is also indicative of the mix parameters. Finally, it should be mentioned that it is the first study that exploits the acoustic activity as early as the moment of mixing while apart from the number of emissions which is usually examined, the monitoring includes waveform parameters that show strong characterization potential.",2016
Compressive strength of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete with crumb rubber partially replacing sand,Geopolymer; Fly ash; Alkaline liquid; Alkaline-activated mix designs; Compressive strength; Crumb rubber,PORTLAND-CEMENT CONCRETE; STEEL,"This study presents the feasibility of geopolymer concrete to which crumb rubber from recycled tires has been added. Geopolymer concrete utilizes industrial by-products like fly ash. Therefore, the use of rubberized geopolymer as a binder in concrete production not only reduces the emission of carbon dioxide, because of the elimination of cement, but also utilizes an industrial disposal of recycled tires to produce a sustainable construction material. In this research, fly ash, an alkaline liquid mix of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate, and crumb rubber were used as the basic constituents of the geopolymer. Various factors that influence the compressive strength were studied, such as molarity of sodium hydroxide, size of aggregates, amount of rubber, and types of fly ash. An appropriate amount of rubber may be replaced with an equal volume of fine aggregates in rubberized geopolymer concrete. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that fine aggregates can be replaced with an equal volume of crumb rubber, up to 5% in three types of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete at the 95% confidence level. The regression model indicates that the correlation between rubber replacement and other parameters are not statistically significant. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

These concretes are constructed using lightweight and strong aggregates. Using different lightweight aggregates to reduce the weight of structural elements and finally structural light weight against earthquake has been development recently. This study applied ultra-lightweight diamotite. This lightweight aggregate has volume weight of 260 kg/m(3) and from weight aspects, it is the lightest lightweight aggregate in the market. In recent years, using different fibers as construction material reinforcement in concrete industry has received much attention. In this study, spiral glass fiber with PVC coating and mesh texture are used. The Researches showed that glass fiber was harmless due to having a PVC coating. This study has experimental evaluation of the effect of using diamotite lightweight aggregate and glass fibers with PVC coating on structural lightweight concrete. To do this, some experiments are performed on all mixtures of lightweight concrete including water absorption test, compressive strength and unit weight on selected mixture design. Based on the results of mentioned constructed samples, the mentioned lightweight concrete had acceptable results despite the low unit weight compared to the similar samples in the presence of diamotite lightweight aggregate and fibers.",2016

Laboratory compaction and strength tests were carried out on ash-slag mixtures at different proportions. The strength was found to increase with slag content. However, the specimens consisting of 30 and 40% of slag and cured for 28 d showed higher strength than the individual materials. Additionally, the effect of different percentages of lime on the strength of the fly ash-slag mixtures was investigated. Tremendous increase in strength was observed with the addition of even 2% of lime. Scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction studies showed the morphological and mineralogical changes that are associated with strength improvement. This study suggests that properly designed combinations of fly ash-slag-lime can be used as construction materials for infrastructure projects such as structural fills or subgrade and sub-base courses in pavements without requiring large quantities of lime.",2016

These sands are mostly dynamic and cause environmental problems. However, these huge quantities of dune sands are considered important natural resources of fine aggregate construction materials. The studied dune sands are predominantly coarse, medium and fine sands with average percentages of 2.4, 19.97 and 76.28 %, respectively, with scarce percents of silt and clay-size particles (around 1 %). The fineness modulus (FM) values of these sands vary from 0.98 to 1.02. Therefore, it is necessary to improve their gradation and textural characters by adding well-graded, crushed fine aggregates to produce an acceptable level of gradation. Mineralogically, the studied dune sands are mainly composed of quartz (88 %), feldspars (9 %) and a negligible amount of carbonates (2.2 %). The workability and compressive strength values of both cement mortar and concrete of the studied dune sands were found to decrease abruptly at dune sand contents[ 50 %. Finally, the studied dune sands are acceptable as fine aggregates for both concrete and mortar when they do not exceed 50 % of the total volume of fine aggregates at a constant mix ratio of 2: 1: 3 (water: cement: fine aggregates) and 1: 2: 4: 6 (water: cement: fine aggregates: coarse aggregates), respectively, for cement mortar and concrete.",2016
On the use of crystalline admixtures in cement based construction materials: from porosity reducers to promoters of self healing,self healing; crystalline admixtures; healing indices; high performance fibre reinforced cementitious composites; chemical prestressing,STRENGTH CONCRETE; FIBER DISPERSION; MAGNETIC METHOD; FLY-ASH; COMPOSITES; STEEL; PERMEABILITY; ORIENTATION,"The project detailed in this paper aims at a thorough characterization of the effects of crystalline admixtures, currently employed as porosity reducing admixtures, on the self-healing capacity of the cementitious composites, i.e. their capacity to completely or partially re-seal cracks and, in case, also exhibit recovery of mechanical properties. The problem has been investigated with reference to both a normal strength concrete (NSC) and a high performance fibre reinforced cementitious composite (HPFRCC). In the latter case, the influence of flow-induced fibre alignment has also been considered in the experimental investigation. With reference to either 3-point (for NSC) or 4-point (for HPFRCC) bending tests performed up to controlled crack opening and up to failure, respectively before and after exposure/conditioning recovery of stiffness and stress bearing capacity has been evaluated to assess the self-healing capacity. In a durability-based design framework, self-healing indices to quantify the recovery of mechanical properties will also be defined. In NSC, crystalline admixtures are able to promote up to 60% of crack sealing even under exposure to open air. In the case of HPFRCCs, which would already feature autogenous healing capacity because of their peculiar mix compositions, the synergy between the dispersed fibre reinforcement and the action of the crystalline admixture has resulted in a likely 'chemical pre-stressing' of the same reinforcement, from which the recovery of mechanical performance of the material has greatly benefited, up to levels even higher than the performance of the virgin un-cracked material.",2016

Consequences of these extreme loading events are known to be catastrophic, involving personnel injuries and fatalities, economic loss and immeasurable social disruption. These impacts are generated not only from direct explosion effects, that is, blast overpressure and primary or secondary fragments, but also from the indirect effects such as structural collapse. The latter one is known to be more critical leading to massive losses. It is therefore imperative to enlighten our structural engineers and policy regulators when designing modern structures. Towards a better protection of concrete structures, efforts have been devoted to understanding properties of construction materials and responses of structures subjected to blast loads. Reliable blast resistance design requires a comprehensive knowledge of blast loading characteristics, dynamic material properties and dynamic response predictions of structures. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of the current blast-resistant design and analysis of concrete structures subjected to blast loads. The blast load estimation, design considerations and approaches, dynamic material properties at high strain rate, testing methods and numerical simulation tools and methods are considered and reviewed.

Development of thermally insulated sustainable building model,recycling & reuse of materials; sustainability; thermal effects,CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; WINDOW; ENERGY; BRICKS; WASTE,"Appropriate construction materials with low thermal conductivity are required to control excess heat gain in building surfaces exposed to hot climates. This paper elaborates on the development and application of three sustainable building materials, namely hollow bricks using construction waste, double-glazed windows insulated with ultraviolet (UV) rejection film and reflecting/insulating roof treatment material. The physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the developed materials were investigated. To investigate the thermal performance experimentally, two small-scale models were developed over the study area. A two-room model (M1) built with fly ash brick, double-glazed (plain glass) windows with UV rejection film (W1) and a conventional reinforced cement concrete roof was compared with another two-room model (M2) built with construction waste bricks, double-glazed (commercial glass) windows with UV rejection film (W2) and a reinforced cement concrete roof that underwent a reflecting/insulating treatment. The results showed that the thermal transmittance of the wall and the roof of model M2 was reduced by 73% and 25% respectively compared with the wall and roof of model M1. Temperature analyses revealed that the west and east rooms of M2 were respectively 2.3% and 5.0% cooler than those of M1.",2016

Copper slag is classified as poorly graded sand (SP) as per the Unified Classification System (USCS) and has a specific gravity of 3.6. Copper slag contains iron silicates, calcium oxide, and alumina, with small amounts of copper, lead, zinc, and other metals. The evaluated gradation, physical, shear strength characteristics and electrochemical properties of copper slag met the standard specifications for a structural fill material recommended for use in mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) walls and reinforced soil slopes (RSS). The angle of shearing resistance of copper slag varied between 35 degrees and 49 degrees for loose and dense states, respectively. Thereafter pullout tests were conducted to determine interface apparent coefficient of friction (mu(S/GSY)) between the geogrid and copper slag at normal stresses of 7.3 kPa, 12.5 kPa, 25 kPa and 50 kPa and obtained results are then compared with those of geogrid in reference fill material, Yamuna sand (YS). The pullout tests were carried out as per ASTM Standard D 6706-01(2013) on an apparatus that was fabricated indigenously. This paper addresses the geogrid - copper slag interaction and geogrid - Yamuna sand interaction from pullout tests and demonstrates that copper slag can be effectively used as a structural fill for reinforced soil structures.

Ground granulated blast furnace slag (S), is a waste by-product derived from steel production. The combustion of coal in power plants produces fly ash (FA) as a waste by-product. The reuse of CG, S and FA as green and sustainable construction materials is of global concern nowadays. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possibility of combining a highly organic waste (CG) with industrial wastes (S and FA) into a sustainable subgrade construction material by a geopolymerization process. A geopolymeric material was synthesized using CG as the base material, and a controlled ratio of S and FA as precursors. A mixture of sodium silicate solution (Na2SiO3) and sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) was used as the alkaline liquid activator (L). Strength development of these geopolymers was assessed using the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) test. Particle bonding and geopolymer matrix pattern of the geopolymers were observed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). With the base material-to-precursor ratio fixed at a ratio of 70:30, the following factors are found to influence strength development in the geopolymer: (1) ratio of S:FA, (2) ratio of Na2SiO3:NaOH, (3) curing time, and (4) curing temperature. When compacted under optimum liquid content (OLC), all the material combinations investigated meet the structural strength requirement for subgrade materials in road embankments specified by various road authorities. It was found that the mixture with CG:S:FA = 70:30:0, Na2SiO3:NaOH = 70:30, and L = 55% was the optimum geopolymer blend recommended, as it produces a relatively high UCS with a relatively low L content. This green geopolymer comprising essentially of waste materials was found to be viable as a stabilized subgrade material. The research findings have the potential to transform the construction industry in the sustainable usage of waste by-products in future road subgrades. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Decontamination of metal-contaminated waste foundry sands using an EDTA-NaOH-NH3 washing solution,Waste foundry sand; Potentially-toxic-elements (PTEs); Washing remediation; Chelant; Ammonia,HEAVY-METALS; EXTRACTION; REMOVAL; SLUDGE; SOIL; REMEDIATION; VARIABLES; CONCRETE; CHELANTS,"Waste foundry sand (WFS), which is a hazardous byproduct from the foundry industry, is often contaminated with potentially toxic elements (PTEs), such as Cu, Pb and Zn, and widely re-utilized as a construction_ material. Therefore, the depollution of WFS has been suggested due to its environment friendly reprocessing to avoid potential long-term hazardous impacts. In the current study, a unique chemically induced technique has been proposed for the removal of PTEs from WFS. EDTA, NaOH and NH3 were used as extractants in combination or in succession. The optimum removal of PTEs was accomplished using a solid (WFS) to solution (50 mmol L-1 EDTA) ratio of 10 under strongly basic pH conditions, which was achieved with NaOH addition. The washing efficiency was further enhanced with the addition of NH3 to the solution. The complete process cycle duration was adjusted to 9 h with a washing sequence that was repeated three times for 3 h each. The ultimate efficiencies (%) for the removal of PTEs were as follows: Cu, 98; Pb, 81; Sn, 83; and Zn, 50. The leaching of residual PTEs (%) from the decontaminated WFS was also in compliance with the regulatory levels that are defined by the monitoring authorities. (C) 2016 Elsevier By.

Oil-palm by-products as lightweight aggregate in concrete mixture: a review,Oil-palm-boiler clinker; Lightweight aggregate concrete; Mechanical properties; Structural behaviour; Prestressing,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CLINKER CONCRETE; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; WASTE MATERIALS; SHELL CONCRETE; MIX DESIGN; PERFORMANCE; SUSTAINABILITY,"d The use of industrial waste as a construction material to build environmentally sustainable structures has several practical and economic advantages. Oil-palm-boiler clinker is a waste material obtained by burning off solid wastes during the process of palm oil extraction. The research performed over the last two decades concerning the use of oil-palm-boiler clinker as a lightweight aggregate to produce structural lightweight aggregate concrete is summarized in this paper. The physical, chemical and mechanical properties of oil-palm-boiler clinker aggregate and the mechanical properties and structural performance of oil-palm-boiler clinker concrete are addressed, discussed, and compared with normal weight concrete. The review of the literature showed that depending on the source of oil-palm-boiler clinker the specific gravity of this aggregate is 15-35% less than normal weight aggregates and it can be used as a lightweight aggregate for making structural lightweight aggregate concrete. Concretes containing oil-palm-boiler clinker as coarse and fine aggregates have the 28-day compressive strength in the range of 17-47 MPa, with a density in the range of 1440-1850 kg/m(3). While, concretes containing oil-palm-boiler clinker as coarse aggregate and normal sand as fine aggregate have the 28-day compressive strength in the range of 15-35 MPa with a density in the range of 1800-2000 kg/m(3). Partial replacement of oil palm shell with oil-palm-boiler clinker in oil palm shell lightweight concrete could significantly improve (about 40%) the compressive strength of the concrete. The research gaps are also identified in this study to explore the innovative lightweight concrete based on the financial and environmental design factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Experimental investigation on impact of sand mining in coastal regions and potential reuse of silica sand as construction material,Sand mining; Coastal erosion; Silica sand; Waste Foundry Sand; Construction material,WASTE FOUNDRY-SAND; BY-PRODUCTS; CONCRETE; WFS,"High quality silica sand has been consumed by foundry in large quantity for casting and moulding process. Foundry successfully recycles and reuses the sand. When it can no longer be reused, it is removed from foundry, termed as Waste Foundry Sand (WFS) and normally disposed off in landfill. The dumping of the fine fraction of WFS and the continuous depletion of sand for construction are two serious environmental problems that can be solved simultaneously by using WFS as construction material. The study aims to determine the optimum percentage of WFS for partial replacement of fine aggregate in concrete and concluded that WFS could be used in making good quality concrete.",2016
Potential of enzymes (urease and carbonic anhydrase) for a sustainable construction industry,Urease; carbonic anhydrase; biomineralization; bioconcrete; biocement; biodeposition,BIOMINERALIZATION; CONCRETE; CEMENT; BACTERIA; STRENGTH,"Concrete is the most commonly used material of numerous structures around the world due to resistance, durability and low cost compared with other construction materials. However, traditional construction materials are susceptible to suffer deterioration by physical, chemical and biological factors that produce irreversible damage to their structure, which requires a high-cost of repair and maintenance. Additionally, during production process cement industry emits about 0.73 -0.99 t CO2/t of cement produced. Bioconcrete is emerging as an ecological, economical and sustainable alternative for construction industry. Biomineralization by bacteria facilitates the development of bioconcrete, wherein calcium carbonate is formed by the metabolic activity of microorganisms, which involves a series of complex reactions directed mainly by urease and carbonic anhydrase enzymes. In this review, biomineralization processes involved in bioconcrete formation and their potential use for the construction industry is discussed.",2016
Investigation of the Effect of Selection of Construction Materials for Radiotherapy Centers,,CONCRETE; BARITE,"Today, with the increasing use of various forms of radiation, all biological organisms are put at risk. Radiation science for medicine, agriculture, industry and military purposes has grown wide. To be protected from the harmful effects of radiation, attention should be paid to the time, distance and shielding rules. Shielding process varies according to the types of materials to be used. Turkey has the most abundant reserves of barite, which is a kind of heavy aggregate. Barite is experimentally used as a heavy concrete aggregate for radiation shielding purposes. In the present study, at first the shield thickness of the designed radiotherapy centre is computed according to the normal and heavyweight concretes. Then, the effect of type of material on the design of the radiotherapy centre is examined carrying out static and structural analyses.",2016
Environmental impact assessment of building foundation in masonry family houses related to the total used building materials,embodied energy; greenhouse gases; sustainability; construction materials; life cycle of buildings,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CARBON; EMISSIONS; CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE,"Analysis of the environmental impact of particular structures may be helpful for selecting building materials, with regard to the environmental performance of buildings in the early project phase. This paper focused on the environmental evaluation of building foundation materials used in eight masonry residential buildings. Environmental evaluation was based on calculation of the embodied energy, the global warming potential, and the acidification potential of building foundations. One kilogramme of built-in foundation materials was responsible for emissions of 0.092 kg of greenhouse gases expressed by carbon dioxide (CO2) and for 0.3 g of acidification gases represented by sulphur dioxide (SO2). Embodied energy was calculated as equal to 1.14 MJ per one kilogramme of foundation materials and 832.2 MJ/m(2) per building floor area. The foundation materials of houses contributed to the total environmental impact of the whole buildings by, on average, 15.0%, 22.8%, and 13.3% for embodied energy, global warming potential, and acidification potential, respectively.

Photocatalytic concretes - The interface between photocatalysis and cement chemistry,Dispersion; pH; Surface Area; Adsorption; Cement; Composite,VISIBLE-LIGHT; SEMICONDUCTOR PHOTOCATALYSIS; TIO2 PHOTOCATALYSIS; POLLUTION,"Concrete materials are ubiquitous in the developed world due to their versatility and cost-effectiveness as a construction material, but their great potential for increased functionality remains underdeveloped. As supports for photocatalysts, these structures offer viable solutions for the reduction of atmospheric pollutant concentrations, the source of which is often associated with urbanisation and the built infrastructure. This paper addresses (i) the photocatalytic mechanisms applicable to atmospheric depollution, (ii) the influence of doping, and (iii) the application of TiO2-based photocatalysts to concrete. Modifications to TiO2 will be discussed which can improve its activation in visible light and, in the treatment of NOx, improve catalytic selectivity towards nitrate rather than the more toxic NO2. The influence of the chemistry of cements on catalyst performance during both concrete placement and in service will also be addressed and some attention will be given to alternative strategies for introducing the photocatalyst to the concrete.

Assessment of the mechanical properties of a concrete made by reusing both: Brewery spent diatomite and recycled aggregates,Brewery spent diatomite; Recycled aggregates; Eco-materials; Compression strength; Flexural strength; Young's module,STRUCTURAL CONCRETE; PARTIAL REPLACEMENT; CEMENT; MANUFACTURE; CERAMICS; STRENGTH; MORTAR; WASTE; RAW,"Since last decades, building construction materials have been widely developed by adding different residues as substitutes of traditional raw materials. This with the aim of both: reducing environmental impact of certain residues and decreasing the carbon foot print regarding to building materials. This paper contributes to such trend by showing the effect of brewery spent diatomite and recycled aggregates on the mechanical properties of concrete when both matters are used together. Therefore mechanical and physical properties of concrete are tested and compared to concrete manufactured by replacing different amounts of cement and natural coarse aggregates with brewery spent diatomite (BSD) and recycled aggregates (RA), respectively. The combined effect of two residues on compressive strength, flexural strength and modulus of elasticity are highlighted. Results show that a 5% of BSD and a 25% of RA can be used as replacement of cement and natural coarse aggregates without significant loss in the mechanical properties when compared to a control concrete.

Assessment of dynamic surface leaching of monolithic surface road materials,Concrete pavement; Asphalt pavement; Diffusion test; Dangerous substances; Water,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; CONSTRUCTION; BEHAVIOR; PAVEMENT; ASPHALT; QUALITY; HIGHWAY; WASTES; WATER; QUANTIFICATION,"Construction materials have to satisfy, among others, health and environment requirements. To check the environmental compatibility of road construction materials, release of hazardous substances into water must be assessed. Literature mostly describes the leaching behaviour of recycled aggregates for potential use in base or sub-base layers of roads. But little is known about the release of soluble substances by materials mixed with binders and compacted for intended use on Toad surface. In the present study, we thus performed a diffusion test with sequential renewal of water during a 64 day period according to CEN/TS 16637-2 specifications, on asphalt concretes and hydraulically bound monoliths, two common surface road materials. It is shown that release of dangerous substances is limited in these hydrodynamic conditions. It was particularly true for asphalt concrete leachates where no metallic trace element, sulphate, chloride or fluoride ion could be quantified. This is because of the low hydraulic conductivity and the low polarity of the petroleum hydrocarbon binder of these specimens. For hydraulically bound materials around 20,000 mg/m(2) of sulphate diffused from the monoliths. It is one order of magnitude higher than chloride diffusion and two orders of magnitude higher than fluoride release. No metallic trace element, except small quantities of copper in the last eluate could be quantified. No adverse effect is to be expected for human and environmental health from the leachates of these compacted surface road construction materials, because all the measured parameters were below EU (Council Directive 98/83/EC) or WHO guidelines for drinking water standards.

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction works. However, further research is required in order to investigate the opportunities and constraints of the use of these technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2016
Investigation of the properties of asphalt mixtures incorporating reclaimed SBS modified asphalt pavement,SBS modified asphalt; Recycling; Rejuvenating agent; Anti crack; Fatigue,RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; REJUVENATING AGENTS; AGED BITUMEN; BINDERS; CONCRETE; PERFORMANCE; BLENDS,"With the increasing environmental considerations and rising costs of construction materials, reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) has been frequently added into asphalt paving mixtures during pavement construction. Many studies have been conducted with regard to the study of reclaimed unmodified asphalt pavement, but the reclaimed SBS modified asphalt pavement is still unknown. In this study, the effects of RAP and rejuvenating agent on the performance were studied. The moisture susceptibility, rutting resistance, dynamic modulus, low temperature anti cracking performance and fatigue was tested. Furthermore, in order to better understand the effects of RAP and rejuvenating agent, the control asphalt mixture was measured using the same methods. The results indicated that the asphalt mixture incorporating reclaimed SBS modified asphalt pavement with better moisture susceptibility, rutting resistance, dynamic modulus, low temperature anti cracking performance and fatigue resistance was obtained by blending new SBS modified asphalt binder and rejuvenating agent. Thus, the rejuvenating agent will benefit the effort of preparing more sustainable asphalt pavement containing RAP. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

This study investigates the effect of early and late age curing of hardened cement pastes made with volcanic ash and Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). Pore and microstructure studies were performed on hardened cement pastes prepared with 10% incremental substitution of volcanic ash up to 50% substitution of OPC. Densification in hardened cement ""pastes was attributed to formation of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) and Calcium-Alumino-Silicate-Hydrate (C-AS-H) gels, while the development of Magnesium-Silicate-Hydrates (M-S-H) led to decalcification of C-S-H and C-A-S-H gels which resulted in an increase in porosity of the cementitious matrix. A combination of bulk and surface characterization techniques was used to facilitate effective usage of volcanic ash as a potential substitute for Portland cement that provides a sustainable construction material, and environmentally friendly solution to volcanic ash disposal.

Hydration properties of ladle furnace slag powder rapidly cooled by air,Ladle furnace slag; Rapid air cooling; Rapid setting cement; Microstructure; Hydration,CALCIUM ALUMINATE CEMENT; ELECTRIC-ARC FURNACE; STEEL SLAG; FLY-ASH; CONCRETE,"Present research provides a series of research to provide the hydration properties of pulverized rapidly air cooled ladle furnace slag. In aspect of sustainability, recycling slags from steel producing industry is valuable, while only blast furnace slag has been used as a construction material. Since the main obstacle of the slags to be used as a construction materials is expansion of the matrix due to the free-CaO or free-MgO. In this research, using high pressured air, the molten ladle furnace slag was cooled down rapidly, and the crystallization of these harmful components were prevented. Furthermore, because of amorphous phases and chemical composition of C(12)A(7), and beta-C2S, the pulverized rapidly air cooled ladle furnace slag showed rapid setting properties. Therefore, in this research scope, the rapid setting properties of rapidly air cooled ladle furnace slag was found. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

Attention is paid to load-bearing capacity and hydraulic characteristics that affect the functionality of these concrete mixtures. Two test categories are examined depending upon the presence of fly ash and each category encompasses seven specimens with a combination of the admixture materials. Experimental results show that the inclusion of fly ash and tire chips decreases the load-carrying capacity of the permeable concrete, whereas that of fibers increases the capacity. The infiltration rate of the concrete is improved by the fibers and the degree of improvement is reliant upon their geometric configurations. Tire chips tend to clog pores and decreases infiltration. The instantaneous load intensity causes significant degradation in hydraulic conductivity, Reynolds number, and infiltration rate; particularly critical when mixed with fly ash. Predictive approaches based on multiple-regression and reliability theory provide useful information on achieving the sustainable design and practice of permeable concrete with the admixtures.

It was considered to be very durable material and required a little or no maintenance since long time. The assumption is very true, except when it is subjected to highly aggressive environments. The deterioration of concrete structures day by day due to aggressive environment is compelling engineers to assess the loss in advance so that proper preventive measure can be taken to achieve required durability to concrete structures. The compounds present in cement concrete are attacked by many salt solutions and acids. These chemicals are encountered by almost all concrete structures. The present study has been undertaken to investigate the effect of attack of chlorides and sulphates with varying severity on compressive strength of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) concrete after immersion in salt solution for 28 days. The results indicate that the durability of GGBFS concrete increases with the increase in percentage replacement of cement by GGBFS for 20% and then gradually decreases with increases in percentage of GGBFS with cement (as in the study for 40% and 60%). Also there is increase in strength of GGBFS concrete with increase in age. Thus the durability of concrete improves when GGBFS is added as partial replacement of cement. In this study the strength of GGBFS concrete is less affected by chemicals as compared to conventional concrete when exposed to aggressive environment.",2016

A Study on Life Cycle CO2 Emissions of Low-Carbon Building in South Korea,life cycle CO2; Korea Life Cycle Inventory Database (KLCI DB); carbon reduction; low-carbon construction materials; building,OF-THE-ART; ENERGY USE; PERFORMANCE; BIOMASS; LCA,"There have been much interest and many efforts to control global warming and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions throughout the world. Recently, the Republic of Korea has also increased its GHG reduction goal and searched for an implementation plan. In buildings, for example, there have been technology developments and deployment policies to reduce GHG emissions from a life cycle perspective, covering construction materials, building construction, use of buildings and waste disposal. In particular, Korea's Green Standard for Energy and Environmental Design is a certification of environmentally-friendly buildings for their energy saving and reduction of environmental pollution throughout their lives. In fact, the demand and adoption of the certification are rising every year. In construction materials and buildings, as a result, an environmentally-friendly aspect has become crucial. The importance of construction material and building development technologies that can reduce environmental load by diminishing GHG emissions in buildings has emerged. Moreover, there has been a rising necessity to verify the GHG reduction effects of buildings. To assess the reduction of carbon emissions in the buildings built with low-carbon construction technologies and materials, therefore, this study estimated life cycle carbon emissions in reference buildings in which general construction materials are used and in low-carbon buildings. For this, the carbon emissions and their reduction from construction materials (especially concrete) between conventional products and low-carbon materials were estimated, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). After estimating carbon emissions from a building life cycle perspective, their reduction in low-carbon buildings compared to the reference buildings was reviewed. The results found that compared to conventional buildings, low-carbon buildings revealed a 25% decrease in carbon emissions in terms of the reduction of Life Cycle CO2 (LCCO2) per unit area. If diverse production technologies and sales routes are further developed for low-carbon construction materials, carbon emission reduction effects would considerably increase.",2016
Construction material properties of slag from the high temperature arc gasification of municipal solid waste,Plasma arc; Gasification; Slag; Waste to energy; Beneficial use,INCINERATOR BOTTOM-ASH; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; TO-ENERGY; CONCRETE; AGGREGATE; COMBUSTION; BEHAVIOR; CEMENT; STEEL; MSW,"Slag from the high temperature arc gasification (HTAG) of municipal solid waste (MSW) was tested to evaluate its material properties with respect to use as a construction aggregate. These data were compared to previously compiled values for waste to energy bottom ash, the most commonly produced and beneficially used thermal treatment residue. The slag was tested using gradations representative of a base course and a course aggregate. Los Angeles (LA) abrasion testing demonstrated that the HTAG slag had a high resistance to fracture with a measured LA loss of 24%. Soundness testing indicated a low potential for reactivity and good weathering resistance with a mean soundness loss of 3.14%. The modified Proctor compaction testing found the slag to possess a maximum dry density (24.04 kN/m(3)) greater than conventionally used aggregates and WTE BA. The LBR tests demonstrated a substantial bearing capacity (>200). Mineralogical analysis of the HTAG suggested the potential for self cementing character which supports the elevated LBR results. Preliminary material characterization of the HTAG slag establishes potential for beneficial use; larger and longer term studies focusing on the material's possibility for swelling and performance at the field scale level are needed.

A practical proposal for solving the world's cigarette butt problem: Recycling in fired clay bricks,Waste management; Cigarette butt; Fired clay bricks; Recycling; Contamination,EVOLVED GAS-ANALYSIS; FLY-ASH; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; LIGHTWEIGHT CONCRETE; SEWAGE-SLUDGE; EMISSIONS; STRENGTH; WASTE; CONSTRUCTION; TEMPERATURE,"The disposal and littering of cigarette butts (CBs) is a serious environmental problem. Trillions of cigarettes are produced every year worldwide, resulting in millions of tonnes of toxic waste being dumped into the environment in the form of cigarette butts. As CBs have poor biodegradability, it can take many years for them to break down. This paper reviews and presents some of the results of a study on the recycling of CBs into fired clay bricks. Bricks with 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, and 10% CB content by weight were manufactured and tested, and then compared against control clay bricks with 0% CB content. The results showed that the dry density decreased by up to 30% and the compressive strength decreased by 88% in bricks with 10% CBs. The calculated compressive strength of bricks with 1% CBs was determined to be 19.53 Mpa. To investigate the effect of mixing time, bricks with 7.5% CB content were manufactured with different mixing times of 5, 10, and 15 min. To test the effect of heating time on the properties of CB bricks, the heating rate used during manufacturing was changed to 0.7, 2, 5, and 10 degrees C min(-1). Bricks with 0% and 5% CB content were fired with these heating rates. Leachate tests were carried out for bricks with 0%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10% CB content. The emissions released during firing were tested for bricks with 0% and 5% CB content using heating rates of 0.7, 2, 5, and 10 degrees C min(-1). The gases tested were carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorine (Cl-2), nitrogen oxide (NO), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). Finally, estimations were made for the energy that could be saved by firing bricks incorporating CBs. Calculations showed that up to 58% of the firing energy could potentially be saved. Bricks were shown to be a viable solution for the disposal of CBs. They can reduce contamination caused by cigarette butts and provide a masonry construction material that can be either loadbearing or non-loadbearing, depending on the quantity of CBs incorporated. This paper proposes the use of bricks with 1% CB content throughout the brick-manufacturing industry. If bricks contained as little as 1% CB content, they would still provide a solution for the issue of CB recycling while maintaining properties very similar to those of a non-CB brick. Our calculations show that, theoretically, only 2.5% of the world's annual brick production is necessary to completely offset the worldwide, annual cigarette production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Ductility enhancement of geopolymer concrete columns using fibre-reinforced polymer confinement,Geopolymer concrete; fly ash; slag; stress-strain relationship; ductility; confinement,FLY-ASH GEOPOLYMER; EARLY STRENGTH PROPERTIES; TEMPERATURE; WORKABILITY,"Geopolymer concrete is an environmentally friendly, green construction material. However, its use is constrained by its increased brittleness and lack of understanding of its behaviour under multi-axial loadings. Similar to ordinary portland cement concrete (OPC), the ductility of geopolymer concrete columns can be increased by lateral confinement and using fibre-reinforced polymers is one option in doing that. This research paper aims at investigating the effect of different confinements on the ductility of geopolymer concrete. Three different mixes with varying binder (fly ash and slag) and different curing conditions together with different levels of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) and glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) confinement were investigated in this research paper. FRP confined normal strength geopolymer concrete shows similar stress-strain behaviour when compared to that of high-strength OPC concrete When compared with the same level of confinement, CFRP confined geopolymer concrete marginally outperforms GFRP confined geopolymer concrete in 28-day compressive strength. However, ductility levels with GFRP confinement are better than those with CFRP confinement.",2016
Study on regional distribution of socio-economic impacts due to S.S.106 Jonica Megalotto 1 construction,,,"This article covers the detailed description and analysis of socio-economic impacts originated from the construction of the S.S. 106 Jonica Megalotto1, a main road infrastructure in Calabria, South of Italy, and their regional distribution, based on the project industrial accounting data provided by Astaldi S.p.A., company who executed the works by means of the fully controlled General Contractor Ar.Gi. S.c.p.A. The Megalotto1 has a 11,277 m long highway design route, with many main works (no. 5 natural tunnels, no. 7 above ground constructed tunnels, no. 8 viaducts, no. 3 main motorway intersections), whose construction was completed in 2014. The data on the construction subcontracts and their regional distribution are summarized in TAB A. Regional distribution of civil works subcontracts, and TAB B. Regional distribution of other subcontracts. The results in terms of on project employed personnel are shown in TAB C. Annual per-sonnel attendance, while those on their regional origin are reported in TAB D. Breakdown on regional basis of the origin of the personnel employed in the contract. The amount of industrial costs spent in the Southern Regions is shown in TAB E. Summary of expenses spent in the South, while the expenditures overall report is described in TAB F. Regional distribution of expenditures compared to revenues. These results demonstrate the crucial contribution to Megalotto 1 construction by the Southern human and entrepreneurial resources and capabilities. Regarding the overall direct and indirect labor employed in the project, totaling 432,210 man days, the percentage of 85.4% was due to people living in Southern Regions, of which 58.6% from Calabria. The whole amount of the impact on employment in the South, also including the effects resulting from the fabrication of materials for the field and the other local indirect costs due to the construction activities, reached the level of almost 2.500 man years. As general economic considerations, an overall cost, equivalent to 79% of the total contractual invoiced amount, was spent in the Southern Regions. A large portion of this industrial cost was related to the supply of most of the construction materials, including a large quantity of on steel and concrete prefabricated components for the civil works. Positive results were also obtained on the social and civil aspects, such as the safety at work (the Gravity index, that measures the serious accidents on the job, was only about at 11% of the national average) and a strict lawfulness control was applied, to grant the legality on any kind of project activity. In conclusion, the results are demonstrating that the Italian Southern Regions have all the capacity in terms of human, entrepreneurial and productive resources to play a leading role in the infrastructural development program of their territory, and that the Megalotto 1 works organization and management methods, that proved to be able to highlight these capabilities, should be considered as best practices for the future projects in that area.",2016

In this paper, the Sarawak fly ash was used to produce geopolymer in comparison to the well-developed Gladstone fly ash-based geopolymer. Characteristics of fly ash and mixtures proportions affecting compressive strength of the geopolymers were investigated. It is found that the variations of both fly ash types on particle size distributions, chemical compositions, morphology properties and amorphous phase correspond to the compressive strength. The results obtained show that after 7 days, geopolymer using Sarawak fly ash has lower compressive strength of about 55 MPa than geopolymer using Gladstone fly ash with strength of about 62 MPa. In comparison with Gladstone fly ash-based geopolymer, it showed that Sarawak fly ash-based geopolymer can be a potential construction material. Moreover, the production of Sarawak fly ash-based geopolymer aids to widen the application of Sarawak fly ash from being treated as industrial waste consequently discharging into the ash pond.

A blurred border between ordinary concrete and SFRC,Steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC); Residual strength; Strength class,FIBER-REINFORCED-CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STEEL FIBER; COMPOSITES; BEAMS; BEHAVIOR; RATIO,"Steel fibre reinforced concrete is a well-established construction material. So far its specific properties have been defined and assessed using multiple, literature defined factors and limits. In 2010 there was published fib Model Code which defines strength classes SFRC. The strength classes are based on values of residual strength tested according to EN 14651. Thus it is now possible to tackle SFRC properties in a very precise way. In the paper the research programme aims to define the blurred border between ordinary concrete and SFRC (made on the basis of aggregate of a largest size of 4 mm). The main goal was to get a minimum critical volume of fibre which would transform ordinary concrete into SFRC with an official strength class. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Bond properties of lightweight concrete - A review,Bond properties; Pull out; Lightweight concrete; Lightweight aggregate,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE; NORMAL-WEIGHT CONCRETE; PALM SHELL OPS; DEFORMED BARS; SLIP BEHAVIOR; STEEL BARS; GFRP BARS; PULL-OUT; STRENGTH,"The use of lightweight concrete (LWC) for structural application has attracted great interest due to its significant benefit in terms of design flexibility and overall costing. However, lack of information in terms of the structural performance such as the bond properties could be a hindrance to the application of LWC in the construction industry since insufficient reinforcement-concrete bonding could result in structural deficiency of reinforced concrete elements. Therefore, in order to establish the idea of using LWC as a more common construction material, this review details the bond performance of LWC, which includes lightweight aggregate concrete, foamed concrete and no-fines concrete and the various factors influencing their behaviour. The review also showed that generally the bond behaviour of LWC complied with bond requirements in codes of practice without the need for safety factors, and this could further enhance the feasibility of LWC for structural applications.

Investigation of early compressive strength of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete,Alkali-activated fly ash concrete; Geopolymer concrete; Early compressive strength; Silica fume activating solution; Sodium silicate activating solution,SLAG,"Development of sustainable construction materials has been the focus of research efforts worldwide in recent years. Concrete is a major construction material; hence, finding alternatives to ordinary Portland cement is of extreme importance due to high levels of carbon dioxide emissions associated with its manufacturing process. This study investigates the effects of activating solution type, curing procedure, and source of fly ash in relation to the resulting compressive strength of fly ash-based geopolymer concrete. The fly ash-based geopolymer paste microstructure was observed and density, absorption and voids were measured. Two activating solutions were used: a) a mixture of sodium hydroxide, silica fume, and water; and b) a mixture of sodium hydroxide solution, sodium silicate, and water. Test results indicate that the resulting concrete has the potential for high compressive strength and the compressive strength is directly affected by the source of fly ash. Results further indicate that compressive strength is not significantly affected by the curing condition when silica fume is used in the activating solution in comparison to the use of sodium silicate.

Three mixtures were produced: conventional mortars, mortars with complete replacement of natural aggregate by 10T, and mortars replacing lime by IOT in proportions from 10% to 100%. IOT and mortars were characterised. Mortars with IOT showed increased bulk density, reduced levels of incorporated air, an increment in the amount of mixing water, and improved mechanical properties when compared with conventional ones.

Analysis of the dynamics of water confined in hydrated calcium silica(C-S-H) based on the quasi-elastic neutron scattering spectra,dynamics of confined water; quasi-elastic neutron scattering spectra; jump-diffusion and rotation-diffusion model; calcium-silicate-hydrated,CEMENT PASTES; SILICATE,"Cement is a widely used construction material in the world. Calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) is the main component of aged cement (concrete). The quality and durability of concrete are strongly affected by the dynamics of water confined in it. Dynamics of the confined water can be studied experimentally by the quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS). In this paper, the jump-diffusion and rotation-diffusion model (JRM) is used to fit the QENS spectra of C-S-H paste samples at different measured temperatures for the whole scattering vector Q-range from 0.3 to 1.7 angstrom(-1). Five important parameters are extracted to describe the dynamics of water confined in C-S-H samples: the index of immobile water C, the rotational diffusion constant D-r, the mean square displacement (MSD) < u(2)>, the self-diffusion coefficient D-t, and the average residence time between jumps tau(0). Here, all the C-S-H samples, each with a 30% weight ratio of water to cement, are measured at temperatures ranging from 230 to 280 K. The fitted parameters can quantitatively describe the dynamics of water confined on different scales of C-S-H gel pores. The results show that the QENS spectra are fitted very well not only for small Q (Q <= 1 angstrom(-1)) but also for large Q ( Q > 1 angstrom(-1)). The obtained rotational diffusion constant is Q dependent. Thus the contribution of the water molecule rotation to a QENS spectrum increases with the value of Q increasing. The mean square displacement (MSD) < u(2)> decreases with the increase of Q, which can be used to distinguish the confined water, ultra-confined water, and bound water contained in C-S-H samples. When Q is small, the fitted D-t and tau(0) vary with the measured temperature. D-t has a maximum value at 230 K and tau(0) has a peak at 240 K. These indicate that the dynamics of the confined water shows different behaviors at 230 K and 240 K. There are crossover or critical phenomena for water confined in C-S-H sample at low temperature.",2016

Physico-mechanical and thermal characteristics were chosen as criteria to assess the feasibility of these types of materials. Results show the significant effect of cork aggregates on lightness and consequently in improving the thermal performance of the developed concrete.

As an alternative method to overcome this disadvantage which is decreasing the strength of the building, it is important to do research on any alternating materials which will decrease the cost and increase the strength of concrete. This conventional construction material likewise made some problems to nature. But coconut fiber, which is natural fiber, makes no impact on environment furthermore increases the strength of concrete compares to other fiber. This paper focuses on the investigation and experimental analysis on the physical characteristics of lightweight foamed concrete (LFC) incorporating coconut fibers composites with different volume percentage of fibers 0.2 and 0.4. LFC is produced by cement paste or mortar in which air-voids are entrapped in the mortar by the suitable foaming agent. Two densities of LFC, 850 and 1200 kg/m(3), were cast and tested. Approximately 0.75% of cement percentage of super plasticizer was used to enhance workability of the fresh mix. The results of the test showed that the both of physical properties of the concrete increases with curing age and quantity of coconut fiber.",2016
Characteristics of an Extrusion Panel Made by Applying a Modified Curing Method,carbon dioxide; steam curing; ground granulated blast furnace slag; ladle furnace slag,RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE; DURABILITY; MORTAR; SLAG,"CO2 emitted from building materials and the construction materials industry has reached about 67 million tons. Controls on the use of consumed fossil fuels and the reduction of emission gases are essential for the reduction of CO2 in the construction area as one reduces the second and third curing to emit CO2 in the construction materials industry. In this study, a new curing method was addressed by using a low energy curing admixture (LA) in order to exclude autoclave curing. The new curing method was applied to make panels. Then, its physical properties, depending on the mixed amount of fiber, type of fiber and mixed ratio of fiber, were observed. The type of fiber did not appear to be a main factor that affected strength, while the LA mixing ratio and mixing amount of fiber appeared to be major factors affecting the strength. Applying the proposed new curing method can reduce carbon and restrain the use of fossil fuels through a reduction of the second and third curing processes, which emit CO2 in the construction materials industry. Therefore, it will be helpful to reduce global warming.",2016

Modern concrete is a mixture of industrial pozzolanic cement formulations and aggregate fillers. The former acts as the glue or binder in the final inorganic composite; however, when exposed to a fire the degree of concrete damage is often difficult to evaluate nondestructively. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy through techniques such as transmission, attenuated total reflectance, and diffuse reflectance have been rarely used to evaluate thermally damaged concrete. In this paper, we report on a study assessing the thermal damage of concrete via the use of a nondestructive handheld FT-IR with a diffuse reflectance sample interface. In situ measurements can be made on actual damaged areas, without the need for sample preparation. Separate multivariate models were developed to determine the equivalent maximal temperature endured for three common industrial concrete formulations. The concrete mixtures were successfully modeled displaying high predictive power as well as good specificity. This has potential uses in forensic investigation and remediation services particularly for fires in buildings.",2016

Recently, the use of cellulosic fibre fabrics and their fabric reinforced polymer composites as reinforcement materials within and/or outside of construction materials (e.g. concrete) has gained popularity due to their inexpensive cost and favourable specific mechanical properties compared with synthetic fibre fabrics (e.g. E-glass). This review presents a summary of recent development on cellulosic fibre Fabric Reinforced Cementitious (FRC) and Fabric Reinforced Geopolymer (FRG) composites, as well as their cellulosic Fabric Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites as reinforcements of concrete, masonry and timber structures for civil engineering applications. This review covers: (1) properties (i.e. chemical composition, microstructure, mechanical properties and cost) of monofilament cellulosic fibres and their comparison with synthetic fibres, the relationship between fibre chemical composition and fibre mechanical properties, parameters affect fibre properties; (2) properties (e.g. fabrication of monofilament fibres to fabrics and structures) of cellulosic fibre fabrics, properties of polymer matrices, and properties (i.e. flexural, tensile, impact, insulation and fire properties) of cellulosic fabric FRP composites; and (3) properties (compressive, flexural and tensile and impact properties) of cellulosic FRC and FRG composites, and the properties of cellulosic FRP composites reinforced concrete, masonry and timber structures. In addition, the degradation mechanisms of cellulosic FRC and FRP are discussed. Furthermore, the durability of FRC, FRG and FRP composites are reviewed and the methods to improve the durability of FRC, FRG and FRP composites from the aspects of fibre modification and matrix modification are reviewed and summarized.

An analogy between various machine-learning techniques for detecting construction materials in digital images,digital images; Multilayer Perceptron (MLP); Radial Basis Function (RBF); Support Vector Machine (SVM); Construction Materials; Detection,RECOGNITION; INFRASTRUCTURE; ALGORITHM; RECONSTRUCTION; NETWORKS; SEARCH,"Digital images and video clips collected at construction jobsites are commonly used for extracting useful information. Exploring new applications for image processing techniques within the area of construction engineering and management is a steady growing field of research. One of the initial steps for various image processing applications is automatically detecting various types of construction materials on construction images. In this paper, the authors conducted a comparison study to evaluate the performance of different machine learning techniques for detection of three common categorists of building materials: Concrete, red brick, and OSB boards. The employed classifiers in this research are: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). To achieve this goal, the feature vectors extracted from image blocks are classified to perform a comparison between the efficiency of these methods for building material detection. The results indicate that for all three types of materials, SVM outperformed the other two techniques in terms of accurately detecting the material textures in images. The results also reveals that the common material detection algorithms perform very well in cases of detecting materials with distinct color and appearance (e.g., red brick); while their performance for detecting materials with color and texture variance (e.g., concrete) as well as materials containing similar color and appearance properties with other elements of the scene (e.g., ORB boards) might be less accurate.",2016
Nondestructive Testing Procedure to Evaluate the Load-Carrying Capacity of Concrete Anchors,Concrete anchors; Nondestructive testing; Schmidt hammer; Load-carrying strength; Capacity evaluation; Rebound number; Construction materials and methods,POST-INSTALLED ANCHOR; ADHESIVE ANCHORS; TENSILE LOAD; DESIGN; MODEL; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; SINGLE,"Concrete anchors are extensively used in the construction industry. Their applications range from erecting permanent objects such as sign poles, direction signs, lighting poles, and so on, to temporary support structures. Several destructive testing equipment types exist in the industry that can be used to evaluate the load-carrying capacity of concrete anchors. However, no nondestructive testing method has been proposed that can estimate their load-carrying capacity. This study develops a new relationship between the pull-out load-carrying capacity, P, of concrete anchors and Schmidt hammer rebound value, R. It was observed from experimentation that the load-carrying capacity of the concrete anchors depends on the embedment length, anchor diameter, concrete strength, and anchor alignment. The effect of anchor alignment was also observed during experimentation, and anchors with ill alignment of more than 5% can lead to lower load-carrying capacity. In addition, it is also possible to identify the ill-aligned concrete anchor and anchor bolt installed in poor quality concrete using the test results. A new type of anchor cage is also developed and presented in the research work that can be used to conduct the pull-out testing using the universal testing machine, eradicating the need for separate pull-out testing devices. The 8-, 10-, and 12-mm diameter concrete anchors were studied, keeping constant the embedment length and concrete strength. The pull-out load strength versus rebound value relationship for each diameter anchor is presented with a corelationship of more than 90%. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2016

However, the culture of coffee drinking generates vast quantities of organic waste that ends up in landfills. Current research trends are inclined towards recycling of waste materials into alternative construction materials, hence the need to research sustainable uses for spent coffee grounds. Coffee grounds (CG) are highly organic with a very high percentage of biodegradable material. The objective of this research was to study the strength development of CG when used as a geopolymer stabilized embankment structural fill material aiming for a better understanding of geopolymer stabilization of highly organic material. Fly ash (FA), being a silica and alumina rich material, was used as a precursor. A liquid alkaline activator, L, being a sodium hydroxide-sodium silicate solution was used for alkali activation of FA in the CG-FA geopolymer. Factors found to affect strength development of the CG-FA geopolymer were: (1)the ratio of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate in the activator liquid; (2)the curing time; (3)the replacement ratio of FA in the CG; (4)the alkalinity of the activator liquid used; and (5)the curing temperature. Optimally, FA can constitute up to 30% of the CG-FA mix for efficient geopolymerization to occur. The concentration of sodium hydroxide can be increased up to 12mol before the strength development-to-alkalinity ratio decreases. The highest strength was found to occur when the curing temperature was 50 degrees C. By introducing 30% of FA into CG, an efficient geopolymer can be synthesized with a L/FA ratio of 1.8 and a Na2SiO3:NaOH ratio of 50:50, which provides the maximum 7-day strength. California Bearing Ratio tests conducted on the CG-FA geopolymer, confirm that it is possible to use geopolymer stabilized CG as an embankment structural fill or subgrade material. Geopolymerization products will further encapsulate and bind the organics in CG, eliminating their potential to biodegrade, which attest to the efficacy of geopolymers as an alternative stabilization agent for highly organic soils.",2016
Design strength evaluation of RC beams under radiation environments for nuclear power plants,,CONCRETE CONTAINMENT STRUCTURES; FLEXURAL BEHAVIOR; BUILDINGS ACI-318; LOAD FACTORS; CALIBRATION; RESISTANCE; CODE; IRRADIATION; EXPOSURE; STEEL,"Neutron irradiation changes the behavior of construction materials such as strength and ductility, and thus structural design equations or their safety margins should accordingly be updated for the design of nuclear power plants (NPP) under irradiation. However, current design codes do not account for such changes in material strength. In this study, a framework is proposed to evaluate the change of the safety margins in design equations of reinforced concrete (RC) flexural members under radiation environments. Material strength changes are approximated on the basis of a collected test database, and the design strengths of RC beams are evaluated considering these material strength changes. The evaluation results demonstrate that the design strength of an under-reinforced flexural member can increase while the design strength of an over-reinforced member generally decreases. These results are associated with the material strength changes such that the yield strength of steel increases and the compressive strength of concrete decreases with the fluence of neutron radiation. Current NPP design codes need to further consider this un-conservative design possibility due to the design strength reduction of flexural members under irradiation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper summarizes the current published literature until 2015, discussing the material properties and recycling methods of plastic and the influence of plastic materials on the properties of concrete. To provide a comprehensive review, a total of 84 studies were considered, and they were classified into sub categories based on whether they dealt with concrete containing plastic aggregates or plastic fibers. Furthermore, the morphology of concrete containing plastic materials is described in this paper to explain the influence of plastic aggregates and plastic fibers on the properties of concrete. The properties of concretes containing virgin plastic materials were also reviewed to establish their similarities and differences with concrete containing recycled plastics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the specific conditions presented by the EC in report 112 (1999) considering building and construction materials, an I-index of 1 may generate an effective dose of 1 mSv per year. This paper presents a comparison of the activity concentrations of K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232 of aggregates and when these aggregates constitute a part of concrete. The activity concentration assessment tool for building and construction materials, the I-index, introduced by the EC in 1996, is used in the comparison. A comparison of the I-indices values are also made with a recently presented dose model by Hoffman (2014), where density variations of the construction material and thickness of the construction walls within the building are considered. There was a similar to 16-19% lower activity index in concretes than in the corresponding aggregates. The model by Hoffman further implies that the differences between the I-indices of aggregates and the concretes' final effective doses are even larger. The difference is due, mainly to a dilution effect of the added cement with low levels of natural radioisotopes, but also to a different and slightly higher subtracted background value (terrestrial value) used in the modeled calculation of the revised I-index by Hoffman (2014). Only very minimal contributions to the annual dose could be related to the water and additives used, due to their very low content of radionuclides reported. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, micromechanical structure of these types of materials can be viewed as periodic structures at different length scales. A new homogenization technique is proposed that is mainly based on the micromechanical averaging schemes for the determination of the mechanical properties of materials with periodic microstructures. This method can be used in determining the overall properties of particulate composites. The proposed technique is a multi-step homogenization technique in which in each step a length scale is considered until the whole reinforcing phase is taken into account. To validate the method, its results are compared with the experimental data on different composite materials with different matrices and fibers. The results show that very good estimates of the mechanical properties is reached by utilizing the proposed multi-step homogenization technique. This method can be utilized in the determination of the mechanical properties of the composites with the coated fibers, where the effect of size of particles on the mechanical properties can be investigated by the application of principles of fractal geometry.

However, mineral wastes derived from C&D activities and waste glass are considered to have potential to be re-used as construction materials, especially as aggregates. In addition, Hong Kong urgently needs alternative and sustainable sources of aggregate, as the local quarry sites for aggregate production are expected to be exhausted soon. Many experimental studies have demonstrated that recycled aggregates from C&D waste and waste glass can be potentially recycled for various engineering applications in Hong Kong, but no study has yet attempted to assess the sustainability by life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques. In order to increase the environmental awareness in the construction industry, assessment of the environmental performance of construction materials by LCA is therefore needed. The present study was conducted to assess and compare the environmental consequences of recycled aggregates production from C&D waste and waste glass, and natural aggregate production from virgin materials by LCA by using case specific and first hand data. The results reveal that compared with natural coarse aggregates, recycled coarse aggregates produced from C&D waste reduce 65% greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission with a saving of 58% non-renewableenergy consumption. Similar environmental benefits are observed for producing recycled fine aggregates from C&D waste. In addition, compared with the production of natural fine aggregates from river sand, producing recycled fine aggregates from waste glass saves 54% energy consumption and reduces 61% GHGs, and 46% SO2 eq emissions. According to the IMPACT 2002+ Method, significant health, resource, climate change and ecosystem damages can be saved in producing recycled aggregates from both waste materials compared to producing and importing aggregates from virgin sources. This is the first ever LCA study on producing recycled aggregates from waste glass. Therefore, it can be concluded that substantial net environmental benefits can be realized for producing recycled aggregates from C&D waste and waste glass. The results can provide a guidance to maximize C&D waste and waste glass recycling, resourceful treatment of wastes and conserve natural resources. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2016
Assessment of Mechanical Properties of Concrete Containing Granite Slurry Waste,Concrete; Granite Slurry Waste; Compressive Strength; Flexural Strength,,"The granite stone is the most widely used in the construction and granite slurry is generated through cutting and polishing of the stone. Granite slurry is waste material consisting of very fine powder and creats disposal and environmental problems in worldwide today. Disposal of granite waste leads to health hazards like respiratory and allergy problems to the people around. It also causes the pollution of air and water. Concrete is the most widely used construction material and innovation in ingredient material (cement and coarse aggregate) is urgently needed. The replacement of natural resources in the production of cement is an important issue in the present construction scenario. Also, the cement industry is one of the principal producers of carbon dioxides. Utilization of granite slurry waste in concrete can solve many problems related to waste generation, reduction in the consumption of natural resources and CO2 emission. Systematic experimental study has been carried out using granite slurry waste in place of cement at various replacement levels. This study has been carried out for w/c 0.5 and 0.4. Specimens have been cast to perform compressive strength test and flexural strength test. It has been shown that inclusion of granite slurry modifies the compressive strength and maximum strength has been obtained depending upon replacement level and w/c ratio. Flexural strength is also influenced by the addition of granite slurry waste in a similar way. These replacement studies demonstrate that the granite slurry concrete will be economically cheaper and more sustainable.",2016

There are now many sustainability drivers for developing novel green construction materials. An emerging material used for building construction is concrete with conventional coarse aggregates substituted as recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). This is a form of sustainable concrete. A finite number of buildings (> 10) with this material have been constructed in North America, Europe and Asia. However; to help facilitate wide spread use and development of sustainable concrete with RCA, there is purpose in considering this material's at-elevated temperature (in-fire) mechanical properties. To date, this topic has seen limited research attention as it is difficult to study. The study herein considered the mechanical properties of conventional and sustainable concrete with RCA. The only difference between the conventional and the sustainable concrete mixes was the mass proportion of a conventional natural coarse aggregate, Limestone, which had been substituted with coarse RCA (at replacement proportions of 0%, 30% and 100%). Both the ambient and elevated temperature mechanical properties were considered with compressive mechanical tests using an innovative optical technology for strain measurement. Based on the analysis performed, a proportional decrease in retained strength and elasticity of concrete at-elevated temperature with increasing RCA content was observed. For example both mechanical properties showed a 0.2% decrease in retained value for every 1% RCA increase at 500A degrees C. In addition the modelling parameter of Poisson ratio appeared to be influenced by the heat imposed and the aggregate type contained within the concrete. For example at 500A degrees C, this parameter showed an 73% increase for concrete samples with only Limestone aggregate and a 15% decrease for samples with only RCA (of mixed origin primarily Siliceous). This paper concludes with highlighting current knowledge gaps and research needs that when addressed could help improve the facilitation of using sustainable concrete's with RCA in construction of buildings.",2016

Different concrete mixes, prepared for three water-cement ratios and 5 jarosite replacement levels. One fourth of cement has been replaced by fly ash in all the concrete mixtures. When compared to the control mixes, encouraging results were obtained in the tests to determine the mechanical properties of the concrete containing jarosite. The other important aspect of concrete i.e. durability has been revealed as satisfactory. The leaching of jarosite in concrete mixtures has been observed within the permissible limits of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The addition of jarosite as a partial sand replacement in concrete (along with fly ash as mineral admixture) up to 25% could be a new alternative feasible solution to its disposal issue. Also, the concrete with 15% jarosite as a sand replacement could be best suited for road and building construction purpose. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

Equivalent volume of 25% cement has also been replaced by fly ash. Durability parameters like chloride diffusion and corrosion in jarosite were determined. Keeping the environmental suitability of concrete in mind, toxicity leaching characteristic potential test has been performed on raw jarosite and concrete samples. It was observed that the chloride diffusion in concrete and corrosion of reinforcement in jarosite added concrete has been less than control mixtures. The satisfactory performance of durability properties has been validated with the Scanning Electron Microscopy images and X-ray diffraction. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2016

First, the mineralogical and chemical compositions as well as geotechnical characteristics of the ETP biosolids and brick soil were determined. Then, bricks were fabricated with five different percentages of ETP biosolids (5%, 15%, 25%, 35%, and 50%) by firing them at a temperature 1020 degrees C for 3 h. The effect of incorporating ETP biosolids in a ceramic body on the physical and mechanical properties of fired-bricks was assessed by shrinkage, weight loss on ignition (LOI), water absorption, density, initial rate of absorption (IRA), compressive strength, efflorescence, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and leachate analysis. The compressive strength of biosolids amended bricks ranged from 24.9 to 37.0 MPa, which met the requirements of the Australian Standards. Moreover, bricks with ETP biosolids can save up to 25% of energy during the firing in an electric furnace, which is very important in terms of sustainable development. The leachate analysis results showed that the concentration of heavy metals leached is insignificant and much lower than the regulatory limits. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

Oil palm shell (OPS) is a solid waste material from the palm oil industry that has been successfully used to produce high strength durable lightweight concrete. However, this concrete is very sensitive to a poor curing environment. Therefore, to produce a cleaner and greener concrete, this study used two waste materials from the palm oil industry as coarse aggregate; OPS aggregates were partially replaced with oil-palm-boiler clinker (OPBC) aggregates from 0 to 50% in OPS lightweight aggregate concrete. Properties including workability, density, compressive strength under eight different curing conditions, splitting tensile and flexural strengths, modulus of elasticity and water absorption of green lightweight concrete were measured and discussed. The results show that it is possible to produce environmentally-friendly and high strength structural lightweight aggregate concrete by incorporating high volume waste lightweight aggregates from the palm oil industry.

A comparative study of high- and low-Al2O3 fly ash based-geopolymers: The role of mix proportion factors and curing temperature,Geopolymer; Low-Al2O3 fly ash; Mix proportion; Compressive strength; Microstructure,SULFATE ACTIVATED SLAG; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; CIVIL ENGINEER; METAKAOLIN; CONCRETE; MICROSTRUCTURE; WORKABILITY; TECHNOLOGY; RESISTANCE; STABILITY,"Developing sustainable and low-CO2 emission construction materials is of essential importance for reducing the environmental footprint of cement industry. In this work, ordinary circulating fluidized bed combustion fly ashes with different Al2O3 concentrations were used to prepare geopolymer. Upon XRD, SEM, FTIR and TG/DSC characterizations, the factors, including Si/Al ratio, the additional water/solid ratio, modulus of alkali activator (molar ratio of SiO2/Na2O) and curing temperature, had been investigated to reveal their influences to the mechanical and microstructural properties of geopolymers. For low-Al2O3 fly ash, the optimal synthesis conditions (curing temperature = 80 degrees C, Si/Al = 2: 1, modulus = 1.5, additional water/solid ratio = 0.1) were obtained. Geopolymers modified with high-Al2O3 fly ash possess superior performance than that of low-Al2O3 fly ash modified samples, in terms of compressive strength and microstructure. This study proves that the application of low-Al2O3 fly ash can be used as a substitute material for geopolymer cement manufacture. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

Quantitatively assessment of elastic properties of a geopolymer and understanding the correlations with its composition and microstructure are therefore very important for its rational utilization. In the present investigation, two series of metakaolin-based geopolymer (MKG) were synthesized by controlling, respectively, mass ratio of alkali in activator to powders, namely the alkali equivalent (AE) to the aluminosilicate materials, within a range of 10%-50% and molar ratio of SiO2 to Na2O in activator, namely modulus of silicate (Ms), within a range of 1.25-2.25. General elastic mechanical properties (i.e., the Young's, bulk and shear moduli and the Poisson's ratio) of the MKG specimens were evaluated from load-strain curves measured by an integrated measurement and control system and the microstructures were determined by an ESEM-EDS analysis. The experimental results, combined with the analysis of variance method, indicate that, within the test ranges, the AE dosage influences all the characteristic elastic properties of the MKG specimens, whereas the effect of Ms level is insignificant. The morphology observations of the microstructures of the MKG specimens support the mechanical results, although both the AE dosage and Ms level change the chemical composition obviously. The results in the present study may help to tailor MKG material with its composition for further engineering applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Recycling of demolition waste in Merseyside,environment; landfill; sustainability,CONCRETE; AGGREGATE,"There have been considerable developments in Merseyside over the last fifteen years with regards to the commercialisation of recycled demolition aggregate. Liverpool is an urban region that at the time was undergoing regeneration. This required the demolition of old infrastructure. Subsequent reconstruction required new construction materials. A project started in 2001 to investigate the economics, practicalities and technicalities of using recycled demolition aggregates in concrete precast products. It was estimated that if all six demolition contractors around Liverpool worked round the clock (i. e. assuming there was enough feed material) they would still have found it difficult to maintain the required supplies for a single precast factory. Investment in equipment was therefore required to guarantee supply and improve the quality of the recycled demolition aggregate. The market forces and the incentives/ drivers for construction companies to adopt sustainable practises have encouraged investment of several million pounds to be made in new recycling plants and has resulted in ` urban quarries'. This paper describes the developments in recycling of construction and demolition waste over the last decade in Merseyside and shows that recycling is not only sustainable but also profitable.",2016

The main objective of the work being the validation of the resulting recycled aggregate mortar for use as a new construction material in Cuba. The recycled aggregates were acquired from the crushing of demolition material obtained from four different houses of distinct construction types. The work was carried out in two experimental stages. In stage 1, mortars with different percentages of recycled aggregates were produced and analysed. The analysis was carried out in order to achieve the optimal mix dosage, while employing the largest usable volume of recycled aggregates and in compliance with the functional requirements established by Cuban regulations. In stage 2, all mortars were produced employing the defined optimal mix proportion The fresh state properties (water retentivity) and hardened state (flexural, compression and bond strengths and capillary absorption capacity) were evaluated in the mortars produced with the other three mixed recycled aggregates of different compositions. It was concluded that the mortars produced with recycled aggregates needed less filler than that of the control mortar in order to obtain adequate properties in their fresh state. However, these recycled aggregate mortars obtained lower mechanical properties and higher capillary absorption that those of the control mortar. Nevertheless they were in compliance with the minimum requirements established in the Cuban regulation.",2016
Microstructural analysis of geopolymers using fused slags with transmission electron microscopy,Fused slag; Geopolymer; Microstructure; Si/Al ratio; TEM,FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; TECHNOLOGY; ACTIVATION; METAKAOLIN; XRD,"The amount of fused slag generated is continuously increasing and is expected to reach 50,000 tons per year as coal gasification facilities and waste treatment systems producing fused slag have been actively adopted recently in Korea. One of the prospective solutions is to make geopolymers with the slags because geopolymers are a cement substitute that can reduce the generation of carbon dioxide and have thus attracted increasing interest from recycling and eco-friendly construction industries because they provide sufficient mechanical strength for application in construction materials. There has not yet been a comprehensive microscopic investigation of geopolymers or diffraction pattern analysis of the crystallites produced by geopolymerization. Geopolymers made of fused slags with an alkali activator exhibited very high compressive strength compared with those of ordinary geopolymers, and their microscopic structures were analyzed by transmission rlectron microscopy (TEM) to confirm the formation of crystallites during the geopolymerization and to explain the relationship between the microstructure and mechanical property of the geopolymers. At least two types of phases, C-S-H and Ca(OH)(2), have been identified by selected area diffraction (SAD) pattern analyses on the crystallites in the geopolymer matrix.",2016
"Applications of the GPR Technique to indoor, bridge deck and pier structures: case studies in Turkey",,GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR; SYNTHETIC-APERTURE RADAR; CONCRETE STRUCTURES; MIGRATION; FORMULATION; WAVE; NDT,"This paper presents the results of three ground-penetrating radar case studies applied to indoor, bridge deck, and pier construction types in Turkey. In these studies, 270-MHz and 1600-MHz antennas were employed to determine the ability limits for construction materials and diagnostic problems associated with the materials. In addition, the importance of the selected survey direction was tested during measurement. Analysing the significance of the migration technique during the data processing stage was another important goal of these case studies. The first case study analyses the indoor applications (e.g., house, villa, and fabric) of ground-penetrating radar and aims to identify possible cracks, structural defects, and corrosion damage. The second case applies ground-penetrating radar to a bridge deck. The third case investigates pier construction by establishing the layout of the construction materials. Identifying possible defects, including structural problems within the pier structure, was another goal. These case studies provide interesting results in terms of physically characterizing the concrete structure and the locations of rebar and slab conditions; the work also reveals the moisture and corrosion effects inside the construction materials on indoor, bridge and pier applications of ground-penetrating radar.",2016
Development of a Tomography Technique for Assessment of the Material Condition of Concrete Using Optimized Elastic Wave Parameters,tomography; honeycomb; pre-stressed concrete (PC); imaging algorithm; ray tracing; wave propagation,ACOUSTIC-EMISSION; FREQUENCY; REPAIR; NDT,"Concrete is the most ubiquitous construction material. Apart from the fresh and early age properties of concrete material, its condition during the structure life span affects the overall structural performance. Therefore, development of techniques such as non-destructive testing which enable the investigation of the material condition, are in great demand. Tomography technique has become an increasingly popular non-destructive evaluation technique for civil engineers to assess the condition of concrete structures. In the present study, this technique is investigated by developing reconstruction procedures utilizing different parameters of elastic waves, namely the travel time, wave amplitude, wave frequency, and Q-value. In the development of algorithms, a ray tracing feature was adopted to take into account the actual non-linear propagation of elastic waves in concrete containing defects. Numerical simulation accompanied by experimental verifications of wave motion were conducted to obtain wave propagation profiles in concrete containing honeycomb as a defect and in assessing the tendon duct filling of pre-stressed concrete (PC) elements. The detection of defects by the developed tomography reconstruction procedures was evaluated and discussed.",2016

In addition, cracks progress due to environmental conditions including damage by freezing, neutralization, and salt, etc. Moreover, detrimental damage can occur in concrete structures due to the permeation of deteriorating elements such as Cl- and CO2. Meanwhile, under an environment in which moisture is being supplied and if the width of the crack is small, a phenomenon of self-healing, in which a portion of the crack is filled in due to the rehydration of the cement particles and precipitation of CaCO3, is been confirmed. In this study, cracks in cementitious composite materials are effectively dispersed using synthetic fibers, and for cracks with a width of more than 0.1 mm, a review of the optimal self-healing conditions is conducted along with the review of a diverse range of self-healing performance factors. As a result, it was confirmed that the effective restoration of watertightness through the production of the majority of self-healing products was achieved by CaCO3 and the use of synthetic fibers with polarity, along with the effect of inducing a multiple number of hairline cracks. In addition, it was confirmed that the self-healing conditions of saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution, which supplied CO2 micro-bubbles, displayed the most effective self-healing performance in the surface and internal sections of the cracks.",2016

Concrete, a common construction material, is known to emit large amounts of environmentally hazardous waste during the processes related to its production, construction, maintenance, and demolition. The amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the product is specified in a ready-mixed concrete report whenever concrete is sold commercially. Hence, there have been many studies addressing the quantitative evaluation and reduction of the environmental effects of concrete. This study aims to introduce a method for assessing the amount of carbon dioxide emission from the processes of producing concrete. Moreover, we measured the quantities of CO2 emission of about 10 under-construction projects, including office buildings, apartment buildings, and high-rise residential buildings in South Korea. Using the assessment result, we analyzed the CO2 reduction performance of an office building in South Korea and drew conclusions about measures for reducing CO2 emission.",2016
"Analysis of Environmental Impact for Concrete Using LCA by Varying the Recycling Components, the Compressive Strength and the Admixture Material Mixing",concrete; life cycle assessment; environmental impact; admixture; recycled aggregate,OZONE CREATION POTENTIALS; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS,"Concrete is a type of construction material in which cement, aggregate, and admixture materials are mixed. When cement is produced, large amounts of substances that impact the environment are emitted during limestone extraction and clinker manufacturing. Additionally, the extraction of natural aggregate causes soil erosion and ecosystem destruction. Furthermore, in the process of transporting raw materials such as cement and aggregate to a concrete production company, and producing concrete in a batch plant, substances with an environmental impact are emitted into the air and water system due to energy use. Considering the fact that the process of producing concrete causes various environmental impacts, an assessment of various environmental impact categories is needed. This study used a life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of concrete in terms of its global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, ozone depletion potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, and abiotic depletion potential (GWP, AP, EP, ODP, POCP, ADP). The tendency was that the higher the strength of concrete, the higher the GWP, POCP, and ADP indices became, whereas the AP and EP indices became slightly lower. As the admixture mixing ratio of concrete increased, the GWP, AP, ODP, ADP, and POCP decreased, but EP index showed a tendency to increase slightly. Moreover, as the recycled aggregate mixing ratio of concrete increased, the AP, EP, ODP, and ADP decreased, while GWP and POCP increased. The GWP and POCP per unit compressed strength (1 MPa) of high strength concrete were found to be about 13% lower than that for its normal strength concrete counterpart. Furthermore, in the case of AP, EP, ODP, and ADP per unit compressed strength (1 MPa), high-strength concrete was found to be about 10%similar to 25% lower than its normal strength counterpart. Among all the environmental impact categories, ordinary cement was found to have the greatest impact on GWP, POCP, and ADP, while aggregate had the most impact on AP, EP, and ODP.",2016
Ecological and economic building assessment on the basis of an example single family house,,CONSTRUCTION,"The present work deals with ecological and economic aspects of construction, maintenance and demolition buildings during a lifetime of 100 years. Therefore a real single family home was planned and analyzed for two different types: solid construction and light weight construction. Nowadays the global warming potential is an important factor for the ecological evaluation of a structure. For comparison, various environmental indicators are discussed, including globalwarming potential, primary energy, water footprint, secondary fuels as well as abiotic resource depletion potential, ozone depletion potential and acidification potential. In addition the finances play an important role in the construction of a house. Construction material in solid construction mainly consists of masonry and reinforced concrete while wood and insulation are primary materials in a lightweight structure. An evaluation and comparison is given in the present work. The comparative analysis indicates an environmental benefit for lightweight construction, and lower costs in the production and maintenance for the massive construction. The presentation of the results and the choice unit can generate advantages or disadvantages for particular construction systems.",2016
Influence of Cyclic Frost Deterioration on Water Sorptivity of Microcracked Cementitious Composites,Cracking; Engineered cementitious composites (ECCs); Frost deterioration; Sorptivity; Mineral admixtures; Self-healing,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; VOLUME-FLY-ASH; DURABILITY; ECC,"Engineered cementitious composites (ECCs) are relatively new construction materials characterized by strain-hardening behavior under excessive tensile loading. Unlike conventional concrete materials, which generally show failure after first tensile cracking, ECCs strain-harden upon excessive loading by creating multiple closely-spaced microcracks. Given the fact that crack widths in ECCs are at micron levels, water movement into these cracks through capillary suction requires further attention, especially under frost action. This paper therefore explores the effectiveness of frost action on water movement into microcracked ECCs. The experimental study covered the sorptivity measurements of ECC mixtures produced with mineral admixtures with different chemical compositions after exposure to cyclic freezing and thawing (F/T), in accordance with ASTM C 666, Procedure A. Air-void characteristics of ECCs were also compared. Experimental findings showed that air-void parameters are not the sole influential parameters on the durability of microcracked ECCs under frost deterioration. Instead of being negatively influenced by the severe conditioning under frost action until the end of 150F/T cycles, sorptivity measurements of ECCs went down owing to self-healing in microcracks, depending on mixture composition. However, after 150F/T cycles, deterioration surpassed the self-healing effect and increased sorptivity measurements.",2016
Compressive Stress-Strain Behavior of HSFRC Reinforced with Basalt Fibers,High-strength fiber-reinforced concrete; Compressive stress-strain behavior; Analytical model; Silica fume; Metakaolin; Basalt fibers; High-strength concrete; Predictive model,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE,"Fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) is a well-recognized construction material because of its vast application in civil engineering structures. The use of steel fibers in FRC is well established in terms of reliable modeling of its mechanical characteristics; however, new fiber reinforcements also need attention. This paper analyzes the compressive stress-strain behavior of three mix types of high-strength fiber-reinforced concrete (HSFRC) having compressive strengths of 70-85MPa and containing 1-3% volume fractions of basalt fibers. In the first mix of HSFRC, 100% cement content was utilized whereas 10% cement content was replaced by silica fume and metakaolin as replacement materials in the remaining two mixes. Based on the experimental data, an analytical model to predict the complete stress-strain behavior of HSFRC is proposed that shows good agreement with experimental results.",2016

The main goal is to evaluate the viability of using this new material as an insulation material for buildings. Several composites with different weight concentrations and three different rape stalk sizes were prepared. The density, compressive strength, and thermal conductivity of the material were measured. Experimental results show that the proposed MPC rape stalk concrete possesses required material properties for production of lightweight concrete in structural and non-structural applications. The physical properties of the rape stalk indicate that it is a promising alternative to hemp hurd for producing plant concrete. Results also indicate that MPC might be a better cementitious material for producing plant aggregate concrete compared with portland cement or lime.",2016

This paper studies the physical and chemical properties of materials, compressive strength, flexural strength, water absorption and porosity of multi blended cements under different curing methods. Fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and rice husk ash (RHA) were used to replace with 50% ordinary Portland cement by mass. Specimens were cured in water (WC), air under room temperature (AC), the combination of hot-water at 60 degrees C for 24 h followed by curing in water (HWC), and air (HAC). The results showed that HAC could be an effective curing method with higher compressive and flexural strengths, lower water absorption and porosity for blended cement mortars. Mortars containing GGBFS in binder had higher enhancement on compressive strength under early hot water curing. While, at 24 h hot water curing mortar containing OPC-RHA-FA binder showed better quality in properties compared to the other binders. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Composite piles: A review,Construction materials; Composite material piles; Fibre-reinforced polymer; Environmental impacts,POLYMER-CONFINED CONCRETE; FRICTION FATIGUE; TUBES; TESTS; BEHAVIOR; COLUMN; MODEL; SAND,"Traditional piling in the form of steel, concrete or timber is susceptible to hazards within harsh marine environments. The deterioration of wood, corrosion of steel and degradation of reinforced/prestressed concrete piles in deep foundations has led researchers to experiment with methods to overcome these problems. Composite material piles, such as fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) and structurally reinforced plastics (SRP), are a unique solution to the problems faced by traditional piling in marine environments. Their resistance to corrosion and long service life make them an economical and environmentally viable solution to traditional piling. Although a few manufacturers have begun to adopt some form of composite piling for fender applications, barriers remain that prevent their widespread use as load bearing piles. These barriers include the lack of specific driving and installation guidelines, limited full-scale geotechnical design data, long-term durability studies and in-depth environmental impact studies. To facilitate research in the aforementioned areas, this review paper details the historical use of composite piles, the structural and geotechnical design of several types of load bearing composite piles, the durability of piles, and, lastly, the construction and manufacturing processes involved. The findings show that there is a general consensus amongst researchers that fibre-reinforced piles (FRP) are structurally and geotechnically suitable for a range of load bearing applications, and that SRP piles, with adequate reinforcement, can potentially be used in deep foundations. More full-scale field research is still needed to develop sufficient driving guidelines, and durability tests emulating saline marine conditions should be carried out to assess the effectiveness of epoxies, and, lastly, reinforcing arrangements should be tested to prevent lateral deflection.

Sustainable utilization of granite cutting waste in high strength concrete,Concrete; Strength; Granite; Permeability; Durability,DURABILITY,"The excessive consumption of river sand as a construction material has led to its acute scarcity. Researchers across the globe have attempted to utilize waste of copper slag, rubber tyre, recycled glass, pond ash, foundry sand, plastic, stone etc. as a partial or complete substitute of river sand in concrete. The present study investigates the feasibility of using granite cutting waste (GCW) as a partial substitute of river sand in high strength concrete based on strength, durability & microstructural attributes. Eighteen concrete mixes were cast at 0.30, 0.35 and 0.40 water cement ratios (w/c) by substituting 0%, 10%, 25%, 40%, 55% and 70% river sand by GCW. The concrete mixes were tested for compressive, flexural strength, abrasive resistance, permeability, water absorption, carbonation, corrosion and microstructure; changes in morphology and hydration were also studied. Test results suggested that 25-40% river sand can be substituted by the GCW with a favourable influence on the investigated parameters. The optimum amount of GCW to be used in concrete depends significantly upon water-cement ratio of concrete. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

It is intended to deal with production of these type of wastes and its accumulation and contribute to the minimisation of carbon and embodied energy in construction materials. The aim is to identify the concrete and mortars formulation types where it is possible to get more benefit by incorporating BA and Bio. Based on the optimisation of the rheological properties of cement-based materials, mortars with repair function and concrete compositions were developed including 0%, 10%, 15% and 20% of BA and Bio as cement replacement. An assessment of the evolution of relative concrete compressive strength was calculated as a function of the relative solid volume fraction of several concretes. BA compositions present low resistance to high flow rates, increasing the ease of placement and vibration. BA seems to present more filler and pozzolanic effect when compared with Bio. BA mortars fulfil the compressive strength and stiffness requirements to be used as repair mortars, allowing the replacement of 15% or 20% of cement by an industrial waste. This by-product is able to work in the development of the mortar and concrete microstructure strength adopting a much more sustainable solution for the environment.",2016

Limited information is available on the comparative heavy metal leaching from coal ash-versus conventional concrete. The current study compared total and leached heavy metal concentrations in unbound coal ash, cement and sand; and investigated the effect of initial leachant pH on heavy metal leaching from coal-ash versus conventional concrete monoliths and their debris. Total Pb, Mn and Zn in coal ash were lower than or similar to that of other materials, while Cu and Fe showed the opposite trend. Leached concentrations of Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu and Fe in unbound coal ash, its concrete and debris were comparable and in some cases even lower than that for conventional concrete. In all cases, leached concentrations accounted for just <1% of the total concentrations. Log log plots of concentration and cumulative release of Fe versus time based on tank leaching data showed that leaching was dominated by diffusion. Overall, the risk of Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu and Fe leaching from coal ash and its concrete was minimal and comparable to that of conventional concrete, a finding in contrast to widely held public perceptions and earlier results reported in other regions such as India. In the current study the coal ash, and its concrete and debris had highly alkaline pH indicative of high acid neutralizing and pH buffering capacity, which account for the stabilization of Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu and Fe. Based on the low risk of Zn, Pb, Mn, Cu and Fe leaching from the coal ash imply that such coal ash can be incorporated in construction materials such as concrete without adverse impacts on public and environmental health from these constituents.

UTILIZATION OF FLY ASH WASTE AS CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL,Fly ash; Waste management; Concrete; Pollozan materials,,"In Malaysia there are six coal fired electric power station for the time being. These power stations usually can produce a high amount of electric power of more than 2400 MW. In peninsular Malaysia, there are four coal fired electric power station that produced at least 1400 MW of electric power. Coal fired electric power station is one of the cheapest electric production compared to the amount of power that can be produced. These power stations are still not enough to cater demand due to future development. Fly ash is a waste byproduct of electric power plants which use coal as their fuel source. Previously, a coal based power station disposed the waste amounts out of their equipment by burying it in landfills or returning it to strip mines. The growth in power plants that use coal as the source of fuel has produced hundreds of millions of tons of ash every year. With the advancement of technology and the economic crisis in Malaysia, the development of infrastructure in the use of new structural materials has been promoted but overall with unsatisfactory results in terms of cost savings. However, this problem can be solved by using waste industrial waste such as fly ash as a source to replace the existing building materials which is cost effective. The main aspect of waste management is to prevent the production of waste through minimizing the waste produced and also re-use of waste materials through recycling. The paper will be discussing the potential of managing waste of fly ash by utilizing it as construction materials.",2016

These cracks lead to significant reduction in concrete service life and high replacement costs. Although it is not possible to prevent crack formation, various types of techniques are in place to heal the cracks. It has been shown that some of the current concrete treatment methods such as the application of chemicals and polymers are a source of health and environmental risks, and more importantly, they are effective only in the short term. Thus, treatment methods that are environmentally friendly and long-lasting are in high demand. A microbial self-healing approach is distinguished by its potential for long-lasting, rapid and active crack repair, while also being environmentally friendly. Furthermore, the microbial self-healing approach prevails the other treatment techniques due to the efficient bonding capacity and compatibility with concrete compositions. This study provides an overview of the microbial approaches to produce calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Prospective challenges in microbial crack treatment are discussed, and recommendations are also given for areas of future research.",2016
Characterization of a sustainable sulfur polymer concrete using activated fillers,Sulfur; Fly ash; Polymer; Hydrocarbon; Alternative binder; X-ray absorption spectroscopy,RAY-ABSORPTION-SPECTROSCOPY; HEAVY PETROLEUM; FORMS; QUANTIFICATION; SOLIDIFICATION; ASPHALTENES; SPECIATION; XANES; WASTE; COALS,"Sulfur polymer concrete (SPC) is a thermoplastic composite concrete consisting of chemically modified sulfur polymer and aggregates. This study focused on the characterization of a new SPC that has been developed as a sustainable construction material. It is made from industrial by-product sulfur that is modified with activated fillers of fly ash, petroleum refinery residual oil, and sand. Unlike conventional sulfur polymer cements made using dicyclopentadiene as a chemical modifier, the use of inexpensive industrial by-products enables the new SPC to cost-effectively produce sustainable, low-carbon, thermoplastic binder that can compete with conventional hydraulic cement concretes. A series of characterization analyses was conducted including thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, and spatially-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy to confirm the polymerization of sulfur induced from the presence of the oil. In addition, mechanical testing, internal pore structure analysis, and scanning electron microscope studies evaluate the performance of this new SPC as a sustainable construction material with a reduced environmental impact.

Micromechanical modelling of deformation and fracture of hydrating cement paste using X-ray computed tomography characterisation,Fracture; Microstructures; Mechanical properties; Micro-mechanics; X-ray computed tomography,NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; MICROSTRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENT; DIFFUSIVITY; EVOLUTION; CONCRETE; MORTARS; MODULI; HOMOGENIZATION; PREDICTION,"Cement paste is the basic but most complex component in cement composites, which are the dominant construction material in the world. Understanding and predicting elastic properties and fracture of hydrating cement paste are challenging tasks due to its complex microstructure, but important for durability assessments and life extension decisions. A recently proposed microstructure-informed site-bond model with elastic-brittle spring bundles is developed further to predict the evolution of elastic properties and fracture behaviour of cement paste. It is based on microstructural characteristics of hydrating cement paste obtained from X-ray computed microtomography (micro-CT) with a spatial resolution of 0.5 mu m/voxel. Volume fraction and size distribution of anhydrous cement grains are used to determine the model length scale and pore-less elasticity. Porosity and pore size distribution are used for tuning elastic and failure properties of individual bonds. The fracture process is simulated by consecutive removal of bonds subjected to surface energy based failure criterion. The stress strain response and elastic properties of hardened cement pastes with curing ages of 1, 7 and 28 days are obtained. The simulated Young's modulus and deformation response prior to peak stress agree very well with the experimental data. The proposed model provides an effective tool to evaluate time evolution of elastic properties and to simulate the initiation, propagation, coalescence and localisation of micro-cracks.

The effect of different Na2O and K2O ratios of alkali activator on compressive strength of fly ash based-geopolymer,Geopolymer; Sarawak fly ash; Alkali activator/ash; Mixture proportions; Compressive strength,METAKAOLIN-BASED GEOPOLYMERS; SOLIDS-TO-LIQUID; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; BLENDED CEMENT; CALCIUM; SLAG; DURABILITY; CONCRETE; SODIUM,"Fly ash sourced from Sarawak, Borneo was alkali-activated by a combination of alkali hydroxides (i.e. NaOH, KOH or Ca(OH)(2)) and sodium silicate (i.e. industrial or commercial grade Na2SiO3) in this research. A comprehensive overview of the compressive strength of geopolymer due to different alkali activator/fly ash and Na2SiO3/NaOH (Na2SiO3/KOH or Na2SiO3/Ca(OH)(2)) were studied. The results show that geopolymer made using Sarawak fly ash can be a potential construction material depending on the requirements of workability and compressive strength. The core study of this research was the investigation on the variations of compressive strength due to the oxide molar ratios. The results revealed that higher oxide molar ratios do not necessarily lead to higher compressive strengths. SiO2/Na2O, Al2O3/Na2O, SiO2/K2O and Al2O3/K2O weight ratios had dissimilar effects on the compressive strength of NaOH- and KOH-based geopolymer. The reduction of SiO2/Na2O and Al2O3/Na2O in NaOH- and KOH-based geopolymer using commercial grade Na2SiO3 intensively increased the strength capability. The ratios of SiO2/Na2O and Al2O3/Na2O in Ca(OH)(2)-based geopolymer were the highest, nevertheless, the compressive strength and workability of Ca(OH)(2)-based geopolymer were the weakest in comparison to NaOH- and KOH-based geopolymers. Na2O was postulated as the major alkali oxide required for the strength development rather than K2O in both NaOH- and KOH-based geopolymer. However, K2O in KOH-based geopolymer may govern the strength development when Na2O is low in the mixture. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Energy efficient concrete with n-octadecane/xGnP SSPCM for energy conservation in infrastructure,Shape stabilized phase change material; Concrete; Energy storage; Thermal performance; Dynamic heat transfer,PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; EXFOLIATED GRAPHITE NANOPLATELETS; THERMAL-PROPERTIES; PCM/DIATOMITE COMPOSITES; HEAT-STORAGE; PCM; PERFORMANCE; BUILDINGS; CONDUCTIVITY,"Among the preparation methods of shape-stabilized PCMs (SSPCMs), incorporation of a PCM into construction materials has been proposed as a passive means of decreasing the overall heating and cooling demand of a building. PCMs can be incorporated in a variety of construction materials, such as gypsum plaster boards, concrete and plaster. In this study, we prepared concrete with a high heat storage property by using n-octadecane based SSPCM for application to building. The prepared SSPCM was applied to the concrete as a fine aggregate because its shape is grain type. Then we prepared the SSPCM concrete by compositing SSPCM to concrete. The physical property of SSPCM concrete was analyzed density analysis. And thermal properties of the SSPCM concrete were analyzed by differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), enthalpy analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Finally, we carried out dynamic heat transfer analysis of the SSPCM concrete for evaluation of peak temperature reduction time lag effect of the prepared samples. From this research, we confirmed the high thermal properties and possibility to apply SSPCM concrete to heat storage structures and various other fields. We expect SSPCM concrete would be useful in heat storage building materials and to establish a heat storage structure for enhancing thermal efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Setting and curing of mortars obtained by alkali activation and inorganic polymerization from sodium silicate and silica aggregate,Silica aggregates; Bricks; Silicates; Mechanical strength; Water insoluble,GEOPOLYMERIZATION RATE,"This research is focused on sodium silicate bonded silica aggregates for making sustainable construction materials such as bricks and precast products. Different compositions are investigated to produce castable mortars. The mortars are cured at temperatures ranging from 150 to 300 degrees C and characterized, in particular microstructural and mechanical properties are investigated. Very high compressive strength of 100 MPa and elastic modulus of 5 GPa are obtained for samples with optimized compositions and heat treatments. Solubility and degradation study of the samples in water demonstrate that alkali silicates are prone to be soluble if not treated at 200 degrees C or above. Transformation of Si-OH to Si-O-Si not only increases the strength but also makes it insoluble in water. It is concluded that sodium silicate bonded bricks and blocks are very promising and affordable materials for construction. They represent an alternative to Portland cement concrete bricks and to sintered clay bricks, providing higher strength and representing an eco-friendly material. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The geopolymer mortars of different cation type, namely sodium based (Na), potassium based (K) and a mixed Na/K, were prepared with dune sand (DS) and river sand (RS). The corresponding geopolymer pastes were also prepared. A series of tests including compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, splitting tensile strength, microanalysis (using scanning electron microscopy), porosity (using mercury intrusion porosimetry), sorptivity and air void (using section analysis method) were carried out. The results showed a strong correlation between strength and porosity of geopolymeric materials. The addition of DS had influences on the chemical compositions and physical properties of geopolymer mortars. These influences were dependent on the type of cation. Based on the results of mechanical properties, DS can be utilised as the fine aggregate for the production of geopolymer based construction material. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Environmental quality of hardened wood fly ash-cement mixtures,environment; recycling & reuse of materials; waste management & disposal,WASTE ASH; BIOMASS; CONCRETE; MORTAR; REPLACEMENT; STRENGTH; REUSE,"Three different samples of woody biomass fly ash were characterised for their hazardousness level using two different compliance leaching tests (American US EPA 1311 toxicity characteristic leaching procedure and European UNI EN 12457-2). Two types of fly ashes (virgin wood and treated wood ash) were then selected and their environmental acceptability as construction materials was assessed through leaching tests on hardened wood ash-Portland cement mixtures at different cement replacement levels (0, 15 and 30 wt%). Leaching tests were performed using both granular samples (pH-dependent leaching test) and monolithic specimens (long-term dynamic leaching tests at constant pH 6.0). All the studied cementitious materials, except the mixture containing 30 wt% treated wood ash, showed good environmental quality when they were tested in the monolithic form and the dynamic leaching test results were analysed through different judgement criteria. The appropriateness of using leaching tests on granular samples of hardened cementitious materials was questioned.",2016
Effect of Gum Arabic karroo as a Water-Reducing Admixture in Concrete,Gum Acacia karroo; concrete; water-reducing admixture; compressive strength,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; HYDRATION; POLYSACCHARIDES; MORTARS; AGENT,"Concrete is one of the most popular construction materials in the world. Chemical admixtures are ingredients added to concrete to enhance its properties. However, most chemical admixtures on the market today are expensive, thereby making them out of reach for small consumers of concrete. In Africa, use of chemical admixtures is rare despite the harsh weather conditions. In the current study, Gum from Acacia karroo (GAK) was used as a water-reducing admixture in concrete. A slump test, density and compressive strength were studied using different dosages of GAK while neat concrete was the control. Results showed that slump increased by 200% at a 2% dosage of GAK. This enabled reduction of water-to-binder (w/b) ratio from 0.61 to 0.48 for samples with a 3% dosage. Reduction in w/b resulted in increased compressive strength of 37.03% above the control after 180 days of curing for a 3% dosage. XRD studies also showed a decreased rate of hydration in the presence of GAK in concrete. It was concluded that GAK can be used in concrete as a water-reducing admixture, which is environmentally-friendly, thus producing sustainable and greener concrete.",2016
Studies on strength and weight loss of paper concrete,concrete technology & manufacture; recycling & reuse of materials; sustainability,WASTE PAPER,"Huge amounts of waste paper are discarded every year, of which only a minute fraction is recycled and the rest is dumped in landfills. Paper fibres can only be recycled a limited number of times before they become too short or weak to make high-quality recycled paper. This eventually adds to the amount of waste paper being generated and not recycled. It would thus be advantageous to use this waste as a low-cost sustainable construction material and make it a value-added product. In this study, Portland pozzolana cement (fly ash based), waste newsprint paper and water were used to prepare paper concrete cubes. Initially, investigations were performed to determine the optimum soaking time required for softening the paper fibres of the newsprint paper. The study mainly addressed the strength and weight loss of the paper concrete cubes with age. The results indicate that, at 28 d, the paper concrete lost 25-50% of its initial weight and a maximum cubic compressive strength of 5.40 MPa was obtained.",2016

Laboratory Study on the Stormwater Retention and Runoff Attenuation Capacity of Four Permeable Pavements,Permeable pavement; Porous asphalt; Interlocking concrete blocks; BMP; SuDS,QUALITY; PERFORMANCE; QUANTITY; CONCRETE; DRAINAGE; ASPHALT; SYSTEMS,"Hydrological behavior of pervious pavements during rainfall events is a complex process that is affected by many factors such as surface type, nature of aggregates, layer thickness, rainfall height, rainfall intensity, and the preceding dry period. In order to determine the influence of construction materials on the runoff attenuation capacity of pervious pavements, 16 laboratory models were created with four different cross sections obtained by combining two pervious surfaces and two subbase aggregate materials. Successive rainfall simulations were applied over the laboratory models, measuring lag times, retained rainfalls, and times to peak, and peak outflows were registered for the simulated rainfalls. The results obtained were grouped depending on the materials used and statistically analyzed in order to compare their stormwater retention and runoff attenuation capacities. Both surface type and subbase aggregate characteristics were proven to influence the attenuation capacity of pervious pavements. While subbase aggregate materials highly influence the hydrological performance during the first rainfall simulations, the permeable surface affects the hydrological behavior during the final rainfall events and the retention capacity variation over time.

Optimizing thermal and mechanical performance of compressed earth blocks (CEB),Lightweight compressed earth blocks; Compacting pressure; Bulk density; Modulus of elasticity; Compressive strength; Thermal conductivity; Thermal effusivity,BUILDING-MATERIALS; STABILIZED SOIL; POROUS CONCRETE; STRENGTH; POROSITY; SIZE,"Compressed earth blocks (CEB) were used for the construction, always and until now systematically with a bulk density of about 1800 and 2100 kg m(-3). These earth construction materials have a relatively high thermal conductivity of about 1.1 W m(-1) K-1. This study aims to obtain lightweight CEB by varying their bulk density in order to modify their porosity and consequently to act on their thermal conductivity. The approach adopted here involves an experimental study of the influence of compaction pressure on the bulk density of the compressed earth block (CEB) and its effects on their thermal performance (thermal conductivity and thermal effusivity) and mechanical properties (compressive strength and modulus of elasticity). Results show that bulk density has a strong influence on thermal and mechanical behavior of CEB. The decrease in the bulk density of CEB was accompanied by a significant reduction in their thermal conductivity and their thermal effusivity. This variation in thermal properties as a function of bulk density is performed linearly. However, the bulk density should not decrease under certain minimum values below which the CEB lose their cohesion and compressive strength. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Significant indicators for biomineralisation in sand of varying grain sizes,MICP; Grain sizes; Deposition rate; Effluent analysis; Approximate relationships,MICROBIAL CARBONATE PRECIPITATION; CALCIUM-CARBONATE; SURFACE-TREATMENT; SOIL IMPROVEMENT; UNDRAINED SHEAR; CONCRETE; BACTERIA; MICROORGANISMS; CONSERVATION; STRENGTH,"Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) is emerging as a sustainable technology for improved construction materials. In this technique, calcium carbonate is deposited in the pores of substrates such as sand and concrete. As the technology moves from laboratory to field new metrics and field measurement techniques are required to ensure that the results achieved at the laboratory are replicated. In the scaled up technique it is not possible to collect samples from deep inside the substrate for direct measurement. This paper explores some indirect indicators of MICP that can be easily monitored in large scale applications. Bacterial fluid has been passed through sand columns of varying grain sizes. The rate of flow is monitored for ten days. The effluent has been tested for pH and electrical conductivity to evaluate their potential for ensuring MICP. The residual urea and calcium in the effluent has been monitored to have a quantitative estimate of MICP. At the end of the tests the quantity of carbonate deposited in the sand columns is measured. A correlation between the residual reactants and the carbonate deposition is developed. An approximate expression for different grain sizes has been developed. This study demonstrates the utility of indirect measurement techniques as flow rate, pH, conductivity, urea and calcium consumption as potential indicators of efficient MICP in sand media.

Quality assessment for recycling aggregates from construction and demolition waste: An image-based approach for particle size estimation,Construction and demolition waste; Image analysis; Particle size distribution; Texture,GRAIN-SIZE; DIGITAL IMAGES; CONCRETE; SEDIMENT; FINE; GRANULOMETRY,"The size distribution of aggregates has direct and important effects on fundamental properties of construction materials such as workability, strength and durability. The size distribution of aggregates from construction and demolition waste (C&D) is one of the parameters which determine the degree of recyclability and therefore the quality of such materials. Unfortunately, standard methods like sieving or laser diffraction can be either very time consuming (sieving) or possible only in laboratory conditions (laser diffraction). As an alternative we propose and evaluate the use of image analysis to estimate the size distribution of aggregates from C&D in a fast yet accurate manner. The effectiveness of the procedure was tested on aggregates generated by an existing C&D mechanical treatment plant. Experimental comparison with manual sieving showed agreement in the range 81-85%. The proposed technique demonstrated potential for being used on on-line systems within mechanical treatment plants of C&D. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Use of bio-briquette ash for the development of bricks,Rio-briquette ash; Brick development; Compressive strength; Physico-chemical property,RICE HUSK ASH; CEMENT; REPLACEMENT; CONCRETE; BLOCKS; WASTE,"The issue of the ever increasing demand for construction materials and waste management has created a need for the development of sustainable materials with the appropriate utilization of wastes. This paper presents the study of the use of bio-briquette ash (BBA) for the development of bricks. Physico-chemical property investigations for a BBA sample were conducted, and the sample was found to be suitable as an alternative raw material for the partial substitution of sand. For the development of the bricks, BBA was added according to the partial replacement method (5-55%) for sand, keeping the cement percentage constant. Six compositions were prepared with 10 wt% variations. The developed product was tested according to the Indian Standards (IS) for density, compressive strength, water absorption and efflorescence along with the durability and thermal properties. The effect of the addition of the BBA on the brick properties was investigated. Thirty-five weight percent BBA, 55 wt% sand and 10 wt% cement were the optimal mix composition for the developed BBA bricks that fulfilled the desired properties of IS. The developed BBA bricks were found to have better mechanical and thermal properties and were more economical than commercially available fly ash and clay bricks. The developed bricks are recommended for non-load bearing walls. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016
Preliminary study for self-sufficiency of construction materials in a Portuguese region - Evora,Self-sufficiency; Construction materials; Portuguese region; Evora,DEMOLITION WASTE; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; LIFE-CYCLE; BUILDING-MATERIALS; ECONOMIC-ANALYSIS; URBAN METABOLISM; ENERGY; RESOURCES; HOUSES; MANAGEMENT,"Production networks are, nowadays, deeply connected, and are often of a regional or global scale. This would not be a problem if it had not been shown that, for most part, these networks exert unsustainable pressure on the environment. That is certainly the case of the construction industry, over which the present paper dedicates its focus, analyzing self-sufficiency within regional boundaries. This work, which focuses on construction materials, is a part of a wider study evaluating the feasibility of self-sufficiency in the Portuguese region of Evora, and includes food production, energy production and water management. After identifying and quantifying the most important and widely used materials in construction within the region (both today and for the future), the study estimates the need and generation potential for each material so as to evaluate and compare them. The study is concentrated strictly within regionally defined boundaries and uses municipality level statistics as much as possible. Because it is a preliminary study, although the evaluation quantifies needs and generation potential, it does not consider details in terms of infrastructure, technology, human labour and/or cost implications. The durability of deposits and technological necessities are analyzed, for the local conditions, and assumptions concerning land occupation and the quantities of resources exploited will also be discussed. The materials analyzed amount to around 98% in mass of all the listed materials, which was considered a good start for a preliminary self-sufficiency resource management study. This research concludes that achieving regional self-sufficiency in construction materials requires a philosophical shift from new construction to maintenance and retrofitting. It also finds that reuse and recycling are major sources of materials that, combined with the previous conclusion, can secure lifetimes of hundreds or even thousands of years for naturally-occurring deposits, including sand, limestone and soils. Moreover, materials such as wood and soils can be crucial to the entire industry's self-sufficiency since they account for as much as 33% of all construction materials' use, in mass weight (replacing large quantities of concrete, sintered ceramics, metals and plastics). Finally, this work contributes to a better understanding of the conditions for, and consequences of, managing construction materials in a self-sufficient way, within a region. Particularly, estimates time until exhaustion of key resources necessary to keep the construction material's cycle, which supply an indication of how sustainable certain construction materials managing practices may be.

Workability and heat of hydration of self-compacting concrete incorporating agro-industrial waste,Self-compacting; Concrete; Workability; Palm oil fuel ash; Fly ash; Heat of hydration,OIL FUEL ASH; HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; FLY-ASH; PALM OIL; PORTLAND-CEMENT; PERFORMANCE; EVOLUTION; MORTARS; TEMPERATURE; TERNARY,"This paper presents an experimental study on the workability and the heat of hydration in Self-compacting concrete (SCC) incorporating agro-industrial waste and blended aggregates. The control mixture contained only Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) as the binder while the remaining mixtures incorporated binary and ternary cementitious blends of OPC, palm oil fuel ash (POFA) and fly ash. The replacement of waste was from 10% to 40% by mass of the total cementitious material of the concrete for workability test and limited to 30% and 40% replacement for the heat of evaluation test. Workability i.e. passing ability, filling ability and segregation resistance was determined and semi-adiabatic temperature rise during the initial stage of hydration was measured by thermocouples. It was observed that fly ash mixes required the least amount of super-plasticiser (SP) to obtain a workable SCC, however, POFA mixes had the reverse effect. The ternary use of POFA and fly ash had better workability properties than the POFA mixes and performed the best in terms of segregation resistance. The ternary mixes also had the lowest amount of heat dissipation with peak temperatures occurring earlier than the fly ash mixes. The experimental studies indicate that ternary blend SCC with POFA and fly ash has significant potential when considering a sustainable construction material hence also providing a cleaner production solution for the palm oil industry.

Influence of recycled concrete aggregates on the flexural properties of reinforced alkali activated slag concrete,Geopolymer concrete; Alkali activated slag; Recycled concrete aggregate; Flexural behavior,STRENGTH; SODIUM; MICROSTRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; INDUSTRY; MORTARS; PASTES; ITZ,"Alkali-activated concretes are a novel invention for substituting conventional construction materials; their main variation from conventional Portland cement concretes is utilizing comparatively alkali-rich, clinker-free binder matrix namely alkali-activated slag or geopolymer. Alkali-activated concrete is an environmental friendly and possibly considered to be a part of the sustainable development. Since, aggregates constitutes the major part of the concrete, there is a need to reduce the use of natural aggregate thereby reducing the exploitation of natural resources. This paper explains the influence of recycled concrete aggregates derived from the demolished concrete waste on the mechanical properties of geopolymer concrete (GPC). Since, very few studies been conducted using recycled aggregates in geopolymer concrete under ambient curing, an experimental work was carried out involving mixes with varying proportion of recycled aggregates and their influence on the physical,, mechanical and flexural characteristics of geopolymer concrete. The results infer that the inclusion of recycled aggregate improves the strength characteristics of geopolymer concrete. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2016

Of all the recycled aggregates those produced from crushed concrete, recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), have been vastly reported. It is shown that the creep of concrete increases at a decreasing rate with increasing coarse RCA, giving an average increase of 32% at 100% coarse RCA content. Factors influencing creep of concrete made with recycled aggregates, such as aggregate size and type, use of pozzolanic cements, water/cement ratio/design strength, curing and loading age have also been reviewed. The experimental creep coefficient data have been compared with the estimated values using selected prediction models. A simple empirical method developed from the globally published data is proposed for estimating creep of concrete made with coarse,RCA. To make RCA more acceptable to specifying structural engineers and to improve its perception as a sustainable construction material that can be successfully used in practice, methods for making the creep of concrete made with coarse RCA similar to the corresponding concrete made with natural aggregates are also proposed.

Innovation of sustainable construction materials through recycling of such waste appears to be a viable solution to this problem. Recycled construction materials will also be an economical option in designing green buildings. The aim of the research is to introduce a building material manufactured out of Building Demolition Waste (BDW) mixed with soil and cement. Waste materials coming out of concrete elements were selected for the study and they were crushed and sieved through 10-15 mm and 15-20 mm sizes separately. Concrete waste was selected for the detailed investigations based on literature review and the performance of several trials. A mix proportion was selected based on the standard testing for grading of aggregate. The processed building demolition waste (BDW) was mixed with cement stabilized rammed earth (CSRE). The optimum proportion of construction waste, soil and cement was established using experimental results on cube testing. The recommended mix proportion was used to construct the wall panels for compressive and flexural testing. Based on the detailed experimental programme, compressive and flexural strength of the composite material, BDW and CSRE is found to be comparable with that of similar conventional materials. The load bearing properties of the composite material have been found satisfactory, for general masonry applications involving single and two storey houses thus indicating the possibility of combining BDW with CSRE to form another greener building material.

Model results from these corrected algorithms are compared with literature results for coefficients applicable to other cities and their varying construction materials. Asphalt and concrete surfaces, canyons and anthropogenic heat releases were found to be the key characteristics of the city center that sustain the elevated surface and air temperatures, under hot, sunny and dry weather, during the Mediterranean summer. A relationship between storage heat flux plus anthropogenic energy flux and temperatures (surface and lower atmosphere) is presented, that results in understanding of the interplay between temperatures, anthropogenic energy releases and the city characteristics under the Urban Heat Island conditions.

Some of his encounters with architects and the built environment, as well as with construction and architectural puzzles are explored in light of Clayton Christensen's (1997) spotlighting of disruptive innovators as being lateral thinkers with business flair. Stratford pioneered manufacture and use by the construction industry of precast concrete window frames that double up structurally as building blocks, as well as precast stairway and ramp systems, and lightweight precast flooring. His architectural style is shown to be rooted in Modernist trends such as, for example, easy flowing of interior/exterior spaces, exposed construction materials and techniques, and use of modular components in varying combinations. These basic design characteristics are expressed with contemporary southern African twists that include paying attention to needs for affordable lower-cost housing, while simultaneously taking delight in exploring architectural possibilities of cold-bending of glass, and paying careful attention to essentials of sustainable architecture that include lowest possible carbon footprint, maximising natural lighting and ventilation, as well as making use of solar and rainwater harvesting opportunities.",2016
MODELING THE BUILDING MATERIALS: APPLICATIONS OF PARTICLE DYNAMICS,dispersions; particle dynamics; building materials,SIMULATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; CONCRETE; FLOW,"Background: In material science, the selection of the appropriate modeling method is usually performed on the basis of spatial scale. The particle dynamics, if properly combined with essential concepts of specific scale, overlaps a lot of spatial scales. Yet, for many dispersions in construction material science, the pair and external forces can be quite complex. Methods: Particle dynamics is combined with specific scalar criteria that allow to describe the kinetics of structure formation of building materials. Results: The representation of dispersion as particle system is formulated and standalone computation software is developed. We have demonstrated that time dependencies of criteria similar to average distance from the surface of each particle to the surfaces of four nearest particles allow to derive substantial data concerning structure formation at micro-scale level. Conclusions: In the present work we have proposed the model, discussed simulation software, and highlighted some modeling results that demonstrate the capabilities of said model and software. It is shown that the developed software can facilitate the insight that reduces time required for the design of novel materials.",2016

Design/methodology/approach - The carbon footprint was calculated using life cycle assessment methodology for five different concrete structure alternatives and five different cement mixes for the same design of a school building. In addition, the uptake of CO2 through the carbonation of concrete during 50 years was calculated. Findings - The carbon footprint of recycled materials can be either the best or worst option, depending on how the materials are used. The difference to using virgin materials is not big. This is mainly due to the lower structural performance of recycled materials, which needs to be compensated for by using additional reinforcements. Using cement mixes that have high amounts of substitutes for cement seems to lower the carbon footprint of structures considerably. The uptake of CO2 in carbonation has potential but requires an optimal design and environment. Originality/value - The findings give information for humanitarian project managers and designers on lowering the carbon footprint of their construction projects.",2016
Promoting building materials that have lower embodied carbon and energy in public procurements Experience from Estonia,Embodied carbon; Embodied energy; Carbon neutral building materials; Cross-laminated timber,INDOOR,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a more carbon efficient alternative design using engineered timber components over reinforced concrete elements to a recently completed nonresidential building located in Tallinn, Estonia. Also to promote building materials that have proved to have lower embodied carbon and energy. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on data collected from the original project drawings, embodied carbon and embodied energy values of construction materials under comparison which are based on Inventory of Carbon & Energy database and on the research conducted in Finland that focussed on wooden building products. The engineered timber solution is designed in accordance with relevant regulations and laws including requirements for fire safety and sound insulation. Findings - Buildings embodied carbon and embodied energy can be reduced by using proposed engineered timber materials.

EFFICIENCY OF APPLICATION OF COMPLEX NANOMODIFYING ADDITIVES BASED ON ZEOLITES IN BUILDING MATERIALS,fine-grained concrete; nanomodifying; synthetic zeolite; natural zeolite; carbon nanotubes; synthesis,,"The paper considers the possibility of using integrated multifunctional additives based on carbon nanotubes and zeolites (natural and synthetic) in construction materials. The nanotubes were produced by catalytic chemical vapor deposition. The streamlined modification of the zeolite structure was performed by impregnating initial materials with a nanotubes-supported catalyst. The present experimental research focused on studying the effect of the synthesized nanomodifying additive on the physicomechanical properties of a composite construction material. Based on the obtained data, it was assumed that when entering the concrete structure, zeolite acts not only as mineral additive but also as nanotubes carrier under the chosen nanomodification conditions for the construction material, thereby allowing for uniform distribution of carbon nanoparticles in the composite matrix; on the other hand, the adsorption properties of zeolite can be reinforced by the presence of carbon in the structure. Structures of nanomodifying zeolites and obtained building composite were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Electron micrographs of the objects makes it possible to explain the processes of formation of the concrete structure, nanomodified complex multifunctional additive based on synthetic and natural zeolites and carbon nanomaterial.",2016

COMPARATIVE STUDY ON INFLUENCES OF VARIOUS FIBERS ON FRACTURE PROPERTIES OF CONCRETE,,REINFORCED CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR,"Concrete is one of the most conventionally consumed construction materials. Concrete technology has developed at a rapid pace over the last several decades and the material performance has been significantly improved. Nowadays, high performance concrete with a compressive strength exceeding 100 MPa can be readily designed and manufactured. However, the low ductility of concrete severely limited its application, more seriously, the brittleness of concrete increases with an increase in its strength. It has been found that different type of fibers added in specific percentage to concrete can improve some specific concrete performance. This study comparatively analyzed the application of three most frequently used fibers, namely, steel, polypropylene and carbon, as reinforcement in normal concrete and ultra high performance concrete. The experimental investigation consisted of compression tests on cubes and fracture tests on notched prismatic specimens made from plain concrete and fiber concrete with 0.5% of various fibers. It was observed from the test results that fibers contribute immensely to the structural integrity and structural stability of concrete elements and thereby improve their fracture properties. Futhermore, the enhancement effects of fibers were investigated, the matching relations between fibers and concretes were represented from the test results.",2016
LIFE CYCLE GHG EMISSIONS FROM A WOODEN LOAD-BEARING ALTERNATIVE FOR A ZEB OFFICE CONCEPT,Embodied emissions; materials; ZEB,,"A major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions is the production of concrete and steel for the construction industry IPCC (2007). To combat global warming, innovative solutions are needed in the construction industry to reduce emissions from both energy and material use in buildings. In a previous study the first phase of a GHG emissions analysis for a Norwegian ZEB office concept was presented. The aim of which was to achieve a zero emission balance where operational and material emissions are accounted for ZEB OM. The results from the first phase showed that the load bearing system accounted for a large share of the embodied emissions. In addition, the ZEB OM ambition level was not met, thus emphasizing the need for further work on alternative solutions and material choices. This paper presents the results of a comparative study between this original office concept study and a predominantly wooden alternative loadbearing structure consisting of wood trusses, glue laminated beams and columns. The wooden alternative is comparable since it has been dimensioned to fulfil the same technical requirements for bearing capacity, sound and fire resistance. In addition, the system boundary was extended to include three alternative end-of-life scenarios. It was found that the wooden alternative structure almost halved the emissions compared to the original concrete and steel ZEB office concept model. This trend is the same in the cradle to gate and all three end-of life scenario's. The analysis clearly shows that emissions from the production process outweigh any emissions from the material's end-of-life treatment. This means that the material choice plays a major role in embodied emissions, as well as it being crucial to reduce the required construction material quantity.",2016

The lightweight sawdust and laterite were studied due to their abundant availability as industrial waste and cheap local construction material. Eco-friendly ICPU is a low-strength concrete with compressive strengths of 6.02-7.57 and 3.66-4.52 N/mm(2) at 5 and 10% sawdust replacements with bulk density ranges of 1,756.62-1,810.9 and 1,522.89-1,532.4 kg/m(3) respectively which exceeded the minimum compressive strength requirement of 3.45 N/mm(2) in non-load bearing concrete applications. Though air curing recorded higher compressive strengths at early curing ages, water curing was recommended to facilitate complete hydration owing to the hygroscopic nature of the sawdust. The packing and filling effects of the lightweight sawdust coupled with the combined pozzolanic properties of the sawdust waste and laterite seemed to have contributed to the slight increase in CS of the eco-friendly ICPU when heated. Effective partnerships among the State and Local Government Waste Management Authorities, sawmill operators and informal waste collectors were recommended for effective sawdust waste recovery, storage and usage in eco-friendly construction.",2016
GROUND-BORNE NOISE AND VIBRATION TRANSMITTED FROM SUBWAY NETWORKS TO A TYPICAL ATHENIAN MULTI-STOREY REINFORCED CONCRETE BUILDING,,,"The transmission of ground-borne vibrations from subway rail transit systems in a building is governed by the soil-foundation interaction, the reduction of vibration level between floors, and the amplification due to resonances of building elements. These are influenced by the type of the building, its construction materials, the foundation soil, and the frequency content of the excitation. A methodology is proposed for the determination of the sound vibration along the height of the building for a specific construction type, demonstrating how the attenuation and amplification parameters can be calculated. For this particular building type, a notable amplification of the vibration due to floor and other structural resonances was found, whereas the vibration and hence the radiated noise levels are similar from the first floor up. An overall building amplification factor is proposed, taking into account all the above mentioned transmission mechanisms.",2016

Impact evaluation of a thin hybrid wood based joist floor,,SOUND; TRANSMISSION,"Using timber as the construction material is a potential solution to achieve life cycle sustainable buildings However, it is clear that impact sound and vibration within the low frequency range is still a challenge for wooden joist floors. Another challenge is the, mostly, larger building heights of wooden or hybrid floors compared to the heights of concrete floors. Using timber as the structural joist floor material could imply fewer stories due to maximum building heights, which renders in less income in a building project. Here, a highly optimized hybrid joist floor consisting of wood, sand and steel is investigated. The aim is to challenge the properties of concrete using more sustainable materials. The main focuses here are the static strength and dynamic properties. The results give information about the attenuation of the structural vibration transmission. The results are useful for making more reliable calculations, to be used for predictions, of acoustics and vibrations of new timber based buildings.",2016

Initial Studies on the Mechanical Properties of Geopolymer Mortar after Additive Stone Powder Treatment,,,"Concrete is the most commonly used construction material. Its use by communities across the globe is second only to water. Geopolymeric binders appear to be an alternative to ordinary portland cement (OPC), due to high mechanical performances and environmental advantages. However the cost of geopolymer binders is still higher than OPC, it is one of the major factors explaining why this new product is not yet a current alternative. So the purpose of this research was reduced the cost of geopolymer binders by addition stone powder (SP) content but mechanical properties of mortar is still good enough to meet essential requirements of industries.

FP1101 and RILEM TC 245 RTE Training School on Assessment and Reinforcement of Timber Elements and Structures: The Role of the Academic Community in Disseminating Knowledge,Assessment; Reinforcement; Timber trusses; FP1101,,"In the past decades, timber has been considered as a secondary construction material owing to the emergence of other materials such as concrete and steel, and as a consequence a large amount of knowledge on how to use timber has been forgotten or even lost. This has led to badly designed interventions on timber structures, which have misinterpreted the past structural solution and led to significant structural performance problems. However, the European research community has made a significant effort towards the dissemination of knowledge regarding the design and assessment of timber structures. Within that scope, COST FP1101 had the objective of increasing the acceptance of timber in both the design of new structures, as well as in the repair of old buildings by developing and disseminating methods to assess, reinforce and monitor them. To that aim, FP1101 and RILEM TC 245 RTE in collaboration with the University of Minho (Portugal) organized a Training School (TS) on the assessment and reinforcement of timber elements and structures during 11-14 May, 2015.

Elasticity Modulus and Flexural Strength Assessment of Foam Concrete Layer of Poroflow,,,"Nowadays, it is necessary to develop new building materials, which are in accordance to the principles of the following provisions of the Roads Act: The design of road is a subject that follows national technical standards, technical regulations and objectively established results of research and development for road infrastructure. Foam concrete, as a type of lightweight concrete, offers advantages such as low bulk density, thermal insulation and disadvantages that will be reduced by future development.

It was shown that utilization of silica sol solution instead of water allows one to improve more than 50% main properties of the concrete on the cement base. Because of that the new technology of fabrication of the underground constructions on the cement base has been suggested (silica sol absorption technology, SAT - technology). Underground construction ability to absorb water has been investigated using wastewater with heavy metal ions.

Intermediate and Low Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Field Transmission Properties in Case of Common Building Materials,electromagnetic fields; radiofrequency; intermediate frequency; shielding; transmission; building materials,CONCRETE; EXPOSURE; WORKERS; MHZ,"Controlling exposure to the electromagnetic fields (EMFs) may serve many causes: to protect sensitive electronic equipment from outside interference; to protect the environment from the high radiation generating equipment; to protect humans from excess radiation etc. Strong EMFs may be encountered in public domain but especially in occupational settings, where the process and technology of work requires the EMFs. Technical measures to manage risks may include using construction materials. In this study the intermediate and low radiofrequency transmission characteristics in case of building materials were investigated. The measurements are called for to determine the amplitude of the electric and magnetic field at the close proximity to the material. A set of common building materials was selected, widely used in modern constructions. The included materials can broadly be divided into three groups: load bearing materials, thermal insulation materials and cover materials. Altogether 17 building materials were tested, forming an overview of some most common materials in construction of houses. The testing was done at 2, 20 and 200 kHz frequencies. The measurement point was in close proximity (10mm) to the material under testing. The electromagnetic irradiator point was on the other side of the material, 150 mm from the measurement sensor. Somewhat frequency dependent variation in the amplification could be observed only in few cases: gypsum panel, aerated concrete, LECA, gypsum board and solid wood. The highest electric field amplification was measured for some materials, up to 5.6 dB increase: custom made gypsum panel, aerated concrete, LECA, gypsum board, high performance concrete plate, solid wood. The results show for the selected samples that semiconductive materials which cannot be grounded due to the high resistance, electric fields may be amplified several folds in close proximity to the material.",2016
Piezoelectricity of Portland Cement Hydrates Cured Under the Influence of Electric Field,,ATOMIC-FORCE; PASTE; COMPOSITES; POLARIZATION; AGGREGATE; COHESION; PRODUCTS; CONCRETE; SURFACE; AFM,"Improvements on functions of construction materials through modifications of material properties from the nano-scale are major concerns in modern civil buildings and infrastructures nowadays. Portland cement (PC) hydrates are the massively applied construction materials, whose new usages have caught the continuously growing interests of current researchers. Though mechanically very robust with feasibility for massive application, PC hydrates have relatively lower piezoelectricity, meaning that constructional mechanical characteristics, such as vibrations and crack locations, cannot be easily detected by the associated piezoelectric signals. The limited piezoelectricity and the difficulty of embedding sensor networks over the entire civil structures induce great technical hurdles for the functional building material applications. Here, we report a novel technique for improving the piezoelectricity of PC hydrates, by applying the polarization process throughout curing of hydrated PC under the influence of an electric field. This technique is based on regulating displacements and reorientations of molecules under the nano-scale interactions between different charged elements consisted in PC hydrates. Results from AFM investigation show the polarized PC hydrates have the relatively more aligned morphology orientation at nano-scale. PC hydrates cured under an electric field has shown with an improved sensitivity of the generated electrical potential under mechanical loading. Our results indicate that the polarized PC hydrates shows improved piezoelectric properties, enabling potential civil applications of the polarized PC hydrates such as structural health monitoring and mechanical energy recycling.",2016
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS-BASED METHODOLOGY FOR TIME-COST-QUALITY TRADE-OFF PROBLEMS,Time-cost-quality trade-off; construction material; construction management,,"Time, cost, and quality (TCQ) as a triple constraint of construction projects have dependent and conflicting objectives. Considering the limited resources, estimation of the approximate TCQ is a complex and dynamic problem. In addition, the uncertain nature of construction projects and highly variable alternatives make the decision making process a complicated issue. In order to overcome these difficulties, many researchers in the related academic literature introduced different mathematical models on the TCQ trade-off problem so far. In these models, two different approaches were used to estimate TCQ-related data. In the continues approach, it was assumed that the relationship among these three components could be expressed by continuous functions. In the discrete approach, it was accepted that (i) the construction method, (ii) the crew formation, and (iii) the crew overtime policy have some impacts on the project TCQ and that the relationships among these three components become discrete. However, in previous studies, construction materials that have a significant impact on TCQ of construction activities and projects were not taken into account completely during the data formation process. As an exception, El Rayes and Kandil [1] considered different strengths of concrete as material alternatives in a highway construction project. In fact, all the studies focused on proving the applicability of different optimization techniques instead of optimizing TCQ of a real construction project. In this context, some simple projects including a limited number of activities were used to evaluate the applicability of the developed models. Therefore, in the present study, it is aimed to outline a new two-step methodology, including the alternative construction material utilization, for TCQ trade-off problems, especially for building projects which enable the utilization of the high variety of construction materials. For this purpose, the impact of construction materials on TCQ of a project was explained in a detailed manner. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2016
Preliminary Resource-based Estimates Combining Artificial Intelligence Approaches and Traditional Techniques,case-based reasoning; hybrid estimation models; neural networks; regression analysis; preliminary estimate of resources,NEURAL-NETWORKS; PROJECTS; SYSTEM; MODEL,"The fate of many construction projects is determined using preliminary project cost estimates. These estimates play a key role during the conceptual phase of projects; as in many cases they are the primary element used to decide their viability. The lack of information and the high levels of uncertainty during the conceptual phase, make it infeasible to have reliable building information models that could be used to generate quantity takeoffs for preliminary cost estimates (known in the industry as 5D BIM), in line with a Level 2 BIM maturity. This paper presents a way to combine artificial intelligence (case-based reasoning and neural networks), with traditional techniques (regression analysis), to develop accurate estimates of the resources needed in a project (e.g., construction material quantities). These estimates of resources can then be coupled with unit cost information to make preliminary resource-based cost estimates. The clear division between the technical and financial components of such an estimate gives improved decision support to project managers and decision makers. This enhances the tracking and control mechanisms which could be used to check the estimates prepared in subsequent project phases. The combination of case-based reasoning with regression analysis and the use of neural networks has shown an improved performance in the estimation of the amount construction material quantities. The proposed combination was used to estimate the amount of concrete, reinforcement, and structural steel required for the construction of tall-frame structures. The results show lower errors (overall mean absolute percentage error-MAPE) for the combined models (2.55%) when compared to the regression models (12.01%), neural network models (5.84%), and case-based reasoning models (9.30%).",2016
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF DIFFERENT CONCRETE MIXES,construction sector; sustainable development; concrete; environmental footprint; LCA,CYCLE ASSESSMENT LCA; BUILDING-MATERIALS,"Out of all global economic activities, the construction sector is considered to have one of the most important social and economic impacts. Most significantly though, this industry has a tremendous negative effect over the Earth's ecosystem, which makes the built environment an important instrument in achieving the primary aspects of the sustainable development at the global scale. The amount of environmental burdens resulted from specific construction activities is influenced by many factors, one of the most dominant being the materials' manufacturing stage. Worldwide, among traditional construction materials, concrete is the most common choice. In addition to being used in large quantities, this material also has an important environmental footprint, making it possible to deduct that it wields a decisive influence over the total impact that the construction sector has on the natural ecosystems. Therefore, in the current context of considering the sustainability concept in all global industries, it is essential that civil engineers understand and interpret the impact of concrete in order to improve the performances of the construction sector with respect to the natural environment. The aim of the present paper is to evaluate and compare the environmental impacts of different classes of concrete by considering four mixes commonly used in Romania. The analysis has been performed using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, and the GaBi is software, obtaining interesting and useful results on the environmental performances of the analysed concrete mixes.",2016
POLYOLEFIN-BASED FIBRES AND COMBINATION WITH STEEL FIBRES: SEEKING A MORE SUSTAINABLE STRUCTURAL CONCRETE,,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; REINFORCED CONCRETE; PLASTIC FIBERS,"The combination of steel and concrete in the forming of reinforced concrete is the most frequently used construction material in the world. Due to the increasing awareness of the impact on the environment of the production processes of materials and construction of infrastructure, the life span of the most important civil structures has recently been increased by up to 100 years. Among the durability issues that can appear in the material during such long periods, the corrosion of steel is one of the most relevant. An option to avoid such problems entails reducing the steel elements embedded in concrete, whether in the form of fibres or re-bars, or substitutingthem for other materials. The development of polyolefin fibres has become one of the most attractive options available in carrying this out. In order to assess the suitability of polyolefin fibres as a substitution for steel fibres, a thorough experimental campaign has been carried out. In addition, a hybrid fibre-reinforced concrete with addition of both steel and polyolefin fibres has also been tested. Compressive strength, indirect tensile strength and modulus of elasticity tests have been performed. Moreover, fracture tests have been conducted in order to evaluate if the properties provided by the fibres enable a reduction or total substitution of steel-bar reinforcement. The results have shown that the simultaneous use of short steel-hooked fibres and longer polyolefin ones is particularly well suited for structural applications where only a reduced amount of cracking is allowed, enabling a reduction of the use of steel and therefore decreasing environmental impact. In addition, the presence of polyolefin fibres improves the toughness and ductility of the PFRC, with it being well suited for its use in construction. The study also provides values of the contribution of the fibres to the residual strength of concrete which deliver relevant information for the structural designer.",2016
SWEDISH VIEW OF CONCRETE AND SUSTAINABILITY,Concrete; Research Needs; Sustainability; Sweden; User Phase,,"Being the most frequently used man-maid construction material with a history of more than 2000 years, concrete may be defined as a sustainable material per se. Correctly designed, properly constructed, and suitably maintained, a concrete structure may reach a life-span that substantially exceeds 100 years. Durability is the bases for sustainability. The importance of sustainability has increased successively during the last 20 years. In the concreteindustry, the focus has been on substituting Portland cement - that roughly stands for 5 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions globally - with various byproducts as slag, fly ash, and silica fume. However, there are many more aspects on sustainable concrete. The Swedish cement producer Cementa AB has a zero vision, i.e., there should be no CO2 emissions in 2030. The goal will be reached by making the kiln more energy efficient, replacing fissile fuels by renewable fuels, taking the carbon uptake through carbonization into account, and by developing carbon capture and storage. We may develop new concrete mixes that either are lean with not more cement than necessary or high strength that will reduce the cross section and thus the dead load considerably. In addition to all these measures on the material side, we must maximize the benefits of concrete during the serviceability state. The effects of energy storage capacity, brightness, and wear resistance make concrete buildings and concrete pavements competitive but by, e.g., increasing density, whiteness, and wear resistance we may save more energy for heating, cooling, illumination, and repaving. Finally, we must not forget concrete's opportunities concerning recycling.",2016
"NOx Adsorption, Fire Resistance and CO2 Sequestration of High Performance, High Durability Concrete Containing Activated carbon",Bio-char; Activated carbon; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; fire resistance; NOx adsorption; high performance concrete; durability,,"The scientific community has conducted limited research to date on the use of activated carbon (or activated char) in concrete. Due to its nature, activated carbon could provide pollutant adsorbing properties and improved fire resistance of concrete. We compared properties of a C50/60 XF4, XC4, XD3, XA3 fire resisting concrete mix (with PP fibers and with activated carbon respectively) used for the construction of the viaducts of the high speed railway system in Southern Switzerland (AlpTransit project). The following properties were compared: compressive and tensile strength, elastic modulus, freeze-thaw resistance, chloride diffusion, capillary permeability, sulphates resistance, accelerated carbonation and resistance to fire (spalling depth and temperature profiles). Results have shown that the use of optimal dosages of activated carbon in high performance concrete does not affect any of its mechanical and durability properties. Results of compressive and tensile strength and elastic modulus were fully comparable with/without activated carbon. Additionally, an improved resistance to fire even in the absence of PP fibers was observed. Activated char seems to therefore offer a greener/technically promising opportunity for the production of high strength, high durability concrete for road tunnels (where increased resistance to fire is mandatory for safety issues, and pollutant adsorbing properties are desirable for environmental issues) and for civil infrastructures in general where the yearly (extremely large) volumes of concrete produced may create long term sink structures for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) adsorption. Because of its nature as a product obtained from thermal cracking of biomass in absence of oxygen, activated char also promotes the exponential increase of CO2 sequestration potential when incorporated into concrete, which is by far the most widely used construction material.",2016
SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT OF CONCRETE WITH RECYCLED CONCRETE AGGREGATES,concrete; sustainability; LCA; recycled aggregate; low CO2,CEMENT; HYDRATION; BETA-C2S; T1-C3S,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material. It causes a substantial environmental impact, derived from CO2 emission, mainly during Portland cement manufacture because of the calcination of the limestone and the fuel consumption. There are several strategies for reducing the amount of Portland cement, e.g. using alternative clinkers, like alkali-activated cements or belite cements, or partial replacement of Portland by secondary cementitious materials, like fly ash, natural pozzolans and/or limestone. Aggregates, as the largest component of concrete, can also have a significant effect on the environmental cost of the concrete mixture. The choice of aggregate influences a wide range of sustainability attributes and as with most aspects of sustainability there are frequently tradeoffs between one choice and another. Aggregate materials of some kind are usually available locally and making best use of this can be preferable for reducing transport related energy use and carbon emissions as well as keeping expenditures in the local economy. In many countries recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) have been proven to be practical for low-strength concretes and to a limited extent for some structural grade concrete. When structures made of concrete are demolished or renovated, concrete recycling is an increasingly common method of utilizing the rubble. Using RCA for new concrete reduces the demand for virgin aggregate conserving natural resources, while minimizing the waste stream by diverting demolished material from landfill. However each case should be individually evaluated and transport and recycling process (sorting, crushing and sieving) must be taken into account. This paper presents a review of the general strategies for reducing concrete environmental impact and a real comparative LCA evaluation of two types of aggregate for precast concrete elements, one natural and one recycled.",2016
STUDY ON THE USE OF RECYCLED HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE AS A CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL,Recycled plastic; Glass Fibre; HDPE Structures; Small Span Bridges,,"Although plastic has been used as a material for industrial products for more than a century, its application as a structural building material is not well defined, as there are no common practice guidelines or norms to control the structural design process. The aim of the paper is to study the behaviour of recycled HDPE (high density polyethylene) as a composite structural material, namely, a techno-economical comparison between reinforced concrete and HDPE reinforced with glass fibre. The structures that were chosen for the theoretical analysis are pedestrian small span bridges subjected to permanent, live and seismic loads, all according to European Norms. The computations made were both analytical and numeric, based on bilinear material models, while Tresca and Von Mises failure criteria were used. The results show that recycled HDPE structures are feasible in terms of techno economic performance for some of the analysed models, creating the premises for further study and standardization in the field.",2016
THERMALLY TREATED SEWAGE SLUDGE AS A POTENTIAL POZZOLANIC ADDITIVE IN CEMENT-BASED COMPOSITES,sewage sludge; thermal treatment; pozzolanic activity; cement-based composites; mechanical and basic physical properties,ASH; SOIL,"Nowadays, due to the rapid development and economic growth, the construction industry brings high demands on concrete and cement clinker manufacturing. With the clinker production, high amounts of CO2 emission and required energy are associated. Additionally, there is a large amount of natural resources used to produce the vast volume of concrete annually. To reduce these harmful secondary effects on the human society and environment, there is a need to find an alternative way to develop construction materials from different sources, including wastes and industrial byproducts. In this paper, the potential use of thermally treated sewage sludge in cement based composites mix design is studied. First, chemical analysis of thermally treated and milled sewage sludge is done using XRF device. The particle size distribution is measured on a laser diffraction principle. Frattini method is used for determination of pozzolanic activity. There are investigated also basic physical properties of sludge as matrix and powder density. Treated sludge is used as an addition to Portland cement by 10, 20 and 30 wt% of cement to preparation of cement-based composites. For the developed composite mixtures, basic physical and mechanical properties are measured. Among the basic physical properties, bulk density, matrix density and total open porosity are investigated. The mechanical properties are measured using standard procedures for compressive strength, flexural strength and dynamic Young's modulus assessment. Obtained results indicate that addition of thermally treated sludge to cement and sand in composite mixtures provides construction material which can be produced with the both economic and environmental benefits, including reduction of CO2 emission.",2016
LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS FOR THE TYPICAL STRUCTURAL SYSTEMS OF ROMANIAN HOUSES,house; embodied energy; masonry; concrete; earthquake,ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; ENERGY; BUILDINGS; SECTOR; LCA,"The energy consumption in the building sector represents up to 40% of the total energy demand of industrialized countries. In Europe, EU Directives and national laws aim to reduce the energy demand of buildings. The most recent regulations do no longer focus only on the operational period, but give more attention to the embodied energy and to the possibility of recycling construction materials at its end of life. The application of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is necessary to certify the global environmental-impact and energy demand during the entire life span of a building. LCA takes into account raw material extraction, manufacturing, use, and end-of-life disposal and recycling. This paper presents the results of a full life cycle assessment study for the typical structural systems of Romanian houses. All the life cycle stages are considered, including house construction, use and demolition after 50 years. A typical detached house is considered for the specific conditions of two major cities: Bucharest (with high seismic demand) and Cluj (with low seismic demand). The two typical structural systems are analyzed: confined masonry walls and reinforced concrete frames with masonry infills. For each configuration, an inventory of the construction materials is made, covering the considered structural building elements. The environmental impact of the structure of the building is assessed, and the effects of its location and structural type are discussed.",2016
"TIMBER, STEEL OR CONCRETE: THE MOST SUSTAINABLE MATERIAL FOR IMPROVEMENT OF THE OPERATION OF EARTHEN CONSTRUCTION AGAINST SEISMIC HAZARDS IN HOT AND ARID REGION: A CASE OF YAZD, IRAN",sustainable building materials; hot and arid region; Timber; Steel; Concrete,,"Mud brick has been the predominant construction material throughout history in the hot and arid region of Iran for thousands of years. This material possesses various environment-friendly characteristics. regarding its formation and accessibility, extraction, transport, construction technologies, low emission, maintenance, durability, reusability etc. However, the operation of traditional adobe construction to withstand earthquakes has always been a controversial issue for designers due to its low resistant against seismic hazards. One key to the safety of adobe buildings against earthquake is an additional building material with good tensile resistance that can create good post-and-beam structure in combination with adobe. This article investigates three possible building materials for this purpose: timber, steel and concrete to find out which is the most sustainable building material for framing of adobe buildings in this region. The study is made by application of qualitative method to provide insights into the research question by gaining an understanding of the underlying factors that make each of these three materials be environmentally sustainable or not. These building materials are compared regarding their degree of environmental sustainability as Well as locality and abundance in the area. For the first item; timber, steel and concrete are compared in three different phases: pre-construction, construction and post-construction, to find out their degree of sustainability as a building material in the region. The results show that timber owns the most sustainable features, steel on the second place, and concrete is the most unsustainable material amongst The three. The following part investigates accessibility of timber and steel in the area to define the most sustainable building material in the region. FAO assessments for forest resource condition are reviewed to assess the accessibility of timber as a building material in hot and arid region of Iran, where suffers from lack of forests. The results demonstrate that Iran's central and-northern forests in their present situation cannot supply the required wood for construction in Yazd. However the present programs for revitalization of the deforested lands can provide the required wood for construction in near future. Meanwhile the present capacity of steel industry in the area and the existing infrastructure. for production of steel as a building material around Yazd is studied. The extensive development of steel industry in Iran during the past fifty years has established a good infrastructure that can produce sufficient steel regarding the considerable resources of iron ore and steel crude in the area. This paper finally proposes, for short term; steel as the binding material for improvement of tensile resistance in adobe construction in Yazd. Timber is however the most environmentally sustainable material to be applied after the improvement of the forests in the country in near future.",2016

The construction industry is one of the largest sectors of the world economy, especially in developing countries with increasing population. A large amount of construction, renovation and demolition activities take place especially in residential buildings, roads, bridges, utilities due to many of the structures mentioned become old. These demolishing and renovation activities create in large volumes of construction and demolition waste (CDW) that should be managed, recycled and disposed. In addition to management of CDW, there are also environmental effects of production of construction materials such as cement and aggregates. Stone mining or quarries crushed stone is the most common method to produce construction materials (aggregates, sand, and cement). The stone pits are operated for long time. During operation, the nature is altered; rehabilitation of pits may be done after pits are closed. Besides, construction and demolishing waste are needed to be stored in large areas. All these mentioned activities effect the environment. Thus, recycling solid materials of CDW provides saving both by reduction use of new material and management costs of waste materials.",2016
ROAD CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ENERGY SAVINGS,cement concrete pavement; asphalt pavement; recycling; reuse of materials; energy consumption; experimental verification,,"The energy consumption of road construction is from the viewpoint of production, processing and transport of materials and mixtures assessed. Total energy and economic demands of a particular technology is the choice of suitable materials and technological processes affected. Tendency of modern society is to find the most acceptable way to reduce the possible negative impact of activities on the environment and humans. In the field of road construction are mainly recycling or reuse of materials, technologies with production and processing at lower temperatures, new materials and additives and not least the modern machine equipment used.

Study on concrete with partial replacement of cement by rice husk ash,,STRENGTH,"Increase in the demand of conventional construction materials and the need for providing a sustainable growth in the construction field has prompted the designers and developers to opt for 'alternative materials' feasible for use in construction. For this objective, the use of industrial waste products and agricultural byproducts are very constructive. These industrial wastes and agricultural by products such as Fly Ash, Rice Husk Ash, Silica Fume, and Slag can be replaced instead of cement because of their pozzolanic behavior, which otherwise requires large tract of lands for dumping. In the present investigation, Rice Husk Ash has been used as an admixture to cement in concrete and its properties has been studied. An attempt was also done to examine the strength and workability parameters of concrete. For normal concrete, mix design is done based on Indian Standard (IS) method and taking this as reference, mix design has been made for replacement of Rice Husk Ash. Four different replacement levels namely 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% are selected and studied with respect to the replacement method.",2016
Problems of export orientation of Ukrainian industrial enterprises,construction materials; exports; imports; domestic market; foreign trade; export restrictions reasons,,"The aim of the article.The purpose of the article is to study the current state of foreign trade in building materials and to identify the main barriers limiting exports in this area. The results of the analysis. Investigation of the main trends of foreign trade of building materials basing on dynamic analysis of statistics allowed to form some conclusions: decline in both production and sales of nearly the entire range of building materials, other than slag wool, mineral wool and cotton mineral silicate, blocks and bricks of cement, concrete or artificial stone for building, which for the period of 2011-2015, notes a slight increase; a high level of dependence of sales of building materials on the pace of construction; preferred orientation of building materials only to the domestic market as the industry as a whole (only 27,5% of sales are exported); the existence of a negative balance, i.e. the predominance of imports over exports during 2007-2015, indicating a lack of involvement of national producers on the domestic market, which means that existing and potential market and discrepancy domestic building materials market needs. At the same time, this type of products relating to export difficult, because imports convinced that building materials are focused not only on the domestic market and linked to the national construction industry. Thus, there is an urgent problem of detection pressing obstacles that hinder the development of foreign trade of building materials. Analysis of the research in this area allowed to form the author's vision on the factors of low levels of foreign trade in construction materials: power industry barriers placing production facilities or tending to the resource base, or to consumers; power production resource constraints low-quality raw materials and obsolete production facilities that do not provide the required quality of products for export; block organizational and legal obstacles inconsistency of standards and quality standards of Ukraine and abroad; ignorance of domestic producers document and the list of customs procedures; bloc organization and staffing constraints the fragmentation of research in this area, which reduces the potential of innovation and human resource capacity mismatch with labor market requirements in this area; power market barriers- lack of comprehensive market research on construction materials market. Thus, the changes taking place in today's geo-economic space dictate new rules for national producers, including operators of construction materials. Companies in this industry go from import substitution to export orientation, which should resolve these issues higher. Access to foreign a market that are already saturated with products, are extremely complex and requires teamwork that closes cooperation between businesses, research institutions and the state. However, the latter subject, the present parliamentary structures and ministries are required to develop a balanced and effective export policy, supported by the legal framework and accession to international treaties that promote the advancement of domestic products to foreign markets, making it easier to bring it into line with international standards. Conclusions and directions of further researches. The authors made some conclusions: 1. The negative dynamics of production and focus on the domestic market of most types of building materials, supported by the lack of a balanced export policy, the total result leads to disappointing conclusions on volumes and directions of export products construction industry. 2. The current problems of export orientation card industry, which has five units: industry, resource and productive, organizational, legal, intellectual and human resources and marketing, detail and describes in detail the main obstacles faced by domestic producers of building materials.

Self-cleaning geopolymer concrete - A review,,CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS; TIO2 NANOPARTICLES; MICROSTRUCTURE; PERFORMANCE; REMOVAL; PASTE,"Concrete is the most widely used construction materials for building technology. However, cement production releases high amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere that leads to increasing the global warming. Thus, an alternative, environmental friendly construction material such as geopolymer concrete has been developed. Geopolymer concrete applies greener alternative binder, which is an innovative construction material that replaces the Portland cement. This technology introduced nano-particles such as nanoclay into the cement paste in order to improve their mechanical properties. The concrete materials also have been developed to be functioned as self-cleaning construction materials. The self-cleaning properties of the concrete are induced by introducing the photocatalytic materials such as titania (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO). Self-cleaning concrete that contains those photocatalysts will be energized by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and accelerates the decomposition of organic particulates. Thus, the cleanliness of the building surfaces can be maintained and the air surrounding air pollution can be reduced. This paper briefly reviews about self-cleaning concrete.",2016

However, the constituent materials used in concrete are high cost when associated with the global economic recession. This exploratory aspires to have an alternative source of replacing natural aggregate with plastic wastes. An investigation of the Modified Artificial Polyethylene Aggregate (MAPEA) as natural aggregate replacement in concrete through an experimental work was conducted in this study. The MAPEA was created to improve the bonding ability of Artificial Polyethylene Aggregate (APEA) with the cement paste. The concrete was mixed with 3%, 6%, 9%, and 12% of APEA and MAPEA for 14 and 28 curing days, respectively. Furthermore, the compressive strength test was conducted to find out the optimum composition of MAPEA in concrete and compared to the APEA concrete. Besides, this study observed the influence and behaviour of MAPEA in concrete. Therefore, the Scanning Electron Microscopy was applied to observe the microstructure of MAPEA and APEA concrete. The results showed the use of high composition of an artificial aggregate resulted inferior strength on the concrete and 3% MAPEA in the concrete mix was highest compressive strength than other content. The modification of APEA (MAPEA) concrete increased its strength due to its surface roughness. However, the interfacial zone cracking was still found and decreased the strength of MAPEA concrete especially when it was age 28 days.",2016

Challenges in treating earthen construction materials as unsaturated soils,,BEHAVIOR,"Earthen construction is a loosely defined term covering both the materials and methods for creating structural components from mixtures of subsoil, often with the addition of chemical or mechanical stabilisers. There is evidence of Man creating earthen structures for thousands of years, and there are many world heritage sites containing earthen structures, some of which present issues in terms of conservation. In some parts of the world there is a growing market for new-build earthen structures and a key issue here is the lack of design codes. Since these materials are composed mainly of particulates and water it is natural to regard them as geotechnical in nature, where friction and the presence of water have a key influence on material properties, however until very recently this was not the case, with earthen construction materials regarded as weak concrete or masonry. In this paper we examine these opposing views and discuss the issues associated with regarding these materials as unsaturated soils.

Assessment of historic buildings by radar techniques,Historic buildings; Guidelines and protocols; Radar investigation,BELL TOWER; GPR SURVEY; RESTORATION; BARCELONA; SPAIN,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to discuss methodological guidelines and operation protocols for the assessment of historic buildings by radar techniques, as decision-making support within integrated investigation programs, where documentary records, direct survey and onsite measurements address accurate and effective diagnosis. Design/methodology/approach - Radar methodologies and procedures are planned to support the pre-diagnosis hypotheses, based on preliminary information from historical sources, as well as from direct survey of geometry, materials, construction techniques and decay patterns. Thus, they are applied, in terms of acquisition and elaboration systems, taking into account the testing targets and surrounding conditions. Finally, they are correlated with complementary destructive and non-destructive techniques for data interpretation and validation. Findings - The general approach is developed for some representative case studies, in order to point out the potentialities of radar techniques for traditional building components. In detail, masonry walls and vaults, as well as iron and reinforced concrete slabs are assessed, in terms of construction materials and techniques, morphology and stratigraphy of multi-layered components, inner voids and inclusions, previous reinforcement works. Originality/value - The above-mentioned issues are particularly relevant in the assessment of historic buildings, where onsite non-destructive technologies are commonly applied, because they help identify the actual characteristics, residual performances and state of conservation, without interfering with structural stability and functional operability, and, thus, address low-intrusive and compatible interventions. Nevertheless, emerging technologies, such as radar scanning, still require guidelines and protocols, in order to achieve reliable and meaningful results and save time and resources, especially whenever technical data are limited, investigation conditions are challenging and different construction solutions are involved.",2016
Experimental Study of Ultra-high Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete under ISO 834 Fire,,RESIDUAL MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; HIGH-TEMPERATURES; HPC,"Ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) is a relatively new construction material that possesses favourable mechanical properties over ordinary concrete. Although enormous strides have been achieved in understanding the performance and behaviour of UHPFRC at ambient temperature, there's little literature and experimental data on their behaviour when submitted to fire. This study presents experimental results of four, 2m long, singly reinforced UHPFRC beams subjected to an ISO 834 fire curve for 60 minutes under a constant load. Two beams contained steel fibres with 2% volumetric ratio while the other set had 4%. Two load ratios of 0.4 and 0.6 were imposed prior to heating and kept constant throughout the fire test. Spalling was observed in all beams, being more severe in beams with steel dosage of 2%.

The Effects of Load Intensity and Restraint on the Fire Resistance of Steel and Composite Beams,,,"The paper presents the results of sixteen fire resistance tests (in accordance with ASTM E119 and ANSI/UL 263 standards) on structural steel beams and composite steel/concrete beams conducted by the authors in 2015 at the Underwriters Laboratories facility in Northbrook, Illinois. The described experimental program was designed to investigate the effects of load intensity and restraint on the fire resistance of steel and composite beams in the context of contemporary construction materials and structural design standards. In terms of the scope and the range of investigated parameters, such experimental study was carried-out in North America for the first time. The test results confirmed the beneficial effects of reduced loads and restraint on the performance of beams in standard fire resistance tests and quantified these beneficial effects in terms of critical (failure) temperatures. The tests results also confirmed and quantified the long existing knowledge about non-composite structural steel beams performing much better than comparable composite steel/concrete beams in fire resistance tests. The generated experimental data will be used to validate numerical models, conduct parametric studies and develop simplified correlations for load intensity versus fire resistance time (and/or protection thickness). It will be of interest to certification laboratories, product developers and the broader structural fire protection design community.",2016

Construction Materials Based on Wastes from Mining and Metallurgical Industries,cement production; waste utilization; project economics,,"It was determined that after removing metal using the method of flow aerosol flotation for the old tailings of the tungsten-molybdenum factory and adding limestone, the mixture is similar to the clinker used in the production of the Portland cement. It was experimentally shown that dumping cakes in the hydrometallurgical production may be divided into a secondary raw tungsten-molybdenum complex and a non-metallic part, which when added to the heavy concrete at a ratio of 20-30% of the amount of cement do not reduce the strength of the concrete samples, actually, a slight increase in strength upon compression is observed. Non-metallic parts may be used as a mineral additive in cement production. The cost of mineral additives is similar to 9.5% of the total costs on raw materials and 2.4% of the direct expenses. The production cost of 1 ton of cement with mineral additives was 1757.09 rubles for a selling price of 3964.36 rubles. The factory price of this cement was 3680-4200 rubles, which provides a positive commercial result. The paper comprises the technical and economic study on the feasibility of utilizing the material according to the developed economic models of waste recycling of lead-zinc ore in the production of construction materials.

It is important to reuse these materials and dispose of them. Waste can be used in the construction industry in two ways: by reusing (reuse components) and recycling (processing waste into raw materials used in the production of building materials). The paper presents my own research using substrates resulting from the processing of waste: foam glass and high-impact polystyrene and the possibility of their use as modifiers composition of basic construction materials. Glass foam is made from glass cullet. It has many advantages, positive effect on the adsorption of sound and workability. Due to the spherical shape and low density it is used as an ultra-light filler. The second addition is High Impact Polystyrene (High Impact Polystyrene - HIPS for short) which is a butadiene rubber modified polystyrene. With the change amount of the rubber mechanical and physical properties of the material are also changed, for example, by increasing the toughness of HIPS.

Ensuring effective functioning of structures during their operation in the harsh environments associated not only with the task of developing materials of higher strength and corrosion resistance, but also composites of increased strength and crack resistance, as structural materials crack resistance is largely determined by the ability of the structure to prevent the formation and growth of cracks. For structures operating in conditions of chemical action, the question of crack resistance is paramount, as the disclosure of cracks in aggressive environment, penetrating deep into the section and causing corrosion of the reinforcement will significantly impair the ability of the load bearing capacity of the element as a whole. The results of experiments of polymer concrete beams of the cross T-profile and comparison of the results with those obtained in an experiment similar to concrete and kauton reinforced elements are given.

Analysis of the Bolted Connection of a Bamboo Composite I-Shaped Beam Subjected to Bending,Sustainability; Green Buildings; Laminated Bamboo; Connections; Bamboo Structures; Bamboo Beam,,"Sustainable development could have a significant impact on conventional construction, reducing or replacing steel and concrete as primary materials in structures. Bamboo, a natural resource, has been used as a general building material for decades in some regions of the world. Countries in Asia and South America have found many uses for bamboo because it grows rapidly and has excellent mechanical properties. The purpose of this paper is to test the designs of different configurations of bolted connections in order to create a composite bamboo I-shaped beam for further applications. Three different configurations of connections for a bamboo composite I-shaped beam were analyzed, with the purpose of identifying an optimal configuration that results in a stiffer, safer beam.

A review on Agricultural Fibre Reinforced Concrete,,STRAW,"The construction industry has undergone rapid development during the last few decades. This significant construction growth has substantially increased the demand for construction materials. Among all materials used in the construction industry, concrete is the most significant. Billions of tonnes of naturally occurring minerals are mined for the production of concrete which has left a big gap in terms of sustainability of the construction industry. To overcome this drawback, the search for durable and sustainable construction materials is currently needed. The world of concrete with fibres has been in continuous research and also in use. However, manmade fibres though enhanced the properties of traditional concrete, are not sustainable and economical. This paper presents a brief review of fibres from agriculture wastes that have been in research and application as potential next generation construction materials. The micro-structure and properties of Agriculture Fibre Reinforced Concrete (AFRC) are described and some current possible applications are mentioned. Various methodology, emerging trends as well as variations in modification techniques for agricultural fibre modified concrete are observed. Several recently published articles and technical papers dealing with such fibre modified concrete are critically reviewed.",2016
"MAIZE STORAGE IN TERMITE MOUND CLAY, CONCRETE, AND STEEL SILOS IN THE HUMID TROPICS: COMPARISON AND EFFECT ON BACTERIAL AND FUNGAL COUNTS",Bacterial count; Fungal count; Grain storage; Maize; Termite mound clay,,"Considering the inadequacy of grain storage structures in Nigeria, which has been partly attributed to high cost and unavailability of construction materials, this study investigated the suitability of using readily available termite mound clay (TMC) for grain silo construction in comparison to conventional reinforced concrete (RC) and galvanized steel (GS) silos for maize storage in the humid tropics. The extent to which temperature and relative humidity affected the quality of stored grain during 8-month unaerated storage, covering both dry and rainy seasons, was evaluated using bacterial and fungal counts as performance parameters. The initial bacterial count of 3500 colony forming units (CFU) per gram (CFU g(-1)) increased to 120000, 11000, and 8800 CFU g(-1) for TMC, RC, and GS silos, respectively. There was no fungal activity at the beginning of storage, but fungal activity increased to 1500, 5500, and 350 CFU g(-1) in TMC, RC, and GS silos, respectively. Fungal activity was noticed in the TMC silo in the fourth month of storage, which coincided with the start of the rainy season. Fungal counts exceeded the acceptable threshold of 1000 CFU g(-1) in the TMC and RC silos. Relative humidity was of greater significance than temperature in affecting all maize quality parameters considered. TMC was found suitable for constructing silos for short-term grain storage under unaerated conditions. Modification of the current TMC silo design to address permeability issues is expected to improve its performance for longer-term maize storage.",2016

Evaluation of Modified Engineered Cementitious Composite with Local Materials,,PVA-ECC,"Engineered cementitious composite (ECC) material is a high-strength, fiber-reinforced, ductile mortar mixture that can exhibit tensile strains of up to 5%. ECC has a dense matrix, which gives the material exceptional durability characteristics. The durability and the mechanical properties of ECC make it a desirable, though expensive, construction material. This paper presents an extensive evaluation of a modified ECC (MECC) prepared with locally sourced raw materials for use as a bridge deck overlay material. MECC is a mixture of cement, fly ash, water, concrete sand, and polyvinyl alcohol fibers. Concrete sand was used in lieu of the typically used silica sand to reduce the high material cost for ECC. Three representative fine aggregates from throughout Nevada were selected to understand how the local aggregates perform in MECC mixes. In total, 18 laboratory mixes of MECC, the polymer concrete, and a traditional PCC mix were evaluated by multiple performance and mechanical tests. After the completion of the laboratory phase, two field trials were conducted to determine the feasibility of batching of large amounts of MECC at commercial concrete batch plants. The large-scale trial of the batches showed that MECC could be produced at typical concrete batch plants with minimal adjustments to the standard of practice. Laboratory test results showed that the use of locally available materials in MECC provided a material with the desirable mechanical and durability properties for use as a bridge deck overlay in Nevada.",2016

One of the main ways of recycling of industrial waste, given the hierarchical order is the production of building materials, including environmentally friendly aerated concrete products with the given (normalized) building-technical properties. The disadvantages of aerated concrete include high rates of absorption, of moisture absorption, low resistance to frost. The proposed method improve the hydrophysical properties of aerated concrete by the joint application of waterproofing additives and hydrophobic traeger in the form of pellets made from bitumen and fly ash. Modified concrete has reduced by 30% of the value of the residual moisture, water absorption 38 ... 39% and capillary leak -30 ... 32%. Modified aerated concrete differs from a traditional to a more uniform fine-pored structure. The results of experimental-industrial tests showed that the proposed technical solutions allow to significantly improve the building-technical properties of aerated concrete, providing it with the competitiveness on the market of construction materials.

The most used cement materials such as the concrete or the mortar blocks have bad thermal characteristic. However, these regions have several local materials: clay, dune sand and some natural fibers, which are formerly proved their thermal efficiency. The price of construction material used therefore depends on the international market constantly destabilized by the economic crisis coupled with the energy crisis in recent times. To produce a framework of life at a lower cost, it is important, therefore, to circumvent the influence of the cost of energy by upgrading the local materials of construction. In order to improve thermal performances in Saharan building materials this study was lanced. The aim of this research isthen to fabricate some bricks using three local materials: namely the clay, sand dune and the fibers of date palm.

Towards Clone-Resistant Building Structures,Clone-resistant Building Structures; Unique Provable Identity for Building Entities; Unclonable-structures; Clone-resistant Physical Units; Secured Identification,,"Secured identification of physical objects is becoming a very essential anchor necessary to realize any robust security systems. Authenticated identities of building entities as steel, precast-concrete, and other construction materials, was rarely addressed as such so far in the open literature. We postulate that ""unclonable"" and provable unique identification of building structures would gain practical interest in the near future smart-homes/cities and even vehicles in many applications. The emerging tendency to network virtually everything in modern infrastructures requires provable automated secured object identification as a security anchor. Surveillance and safety applications in emerging smart cities linked to e-government/e-management are expected to save costs, ease and automate, speed up and consolidate future state managements. The objective of this work is to investigate usage scenarios of secured unique identification of physical building elements in real world applications. Furthermore, we propose what we call as ""Structronic"" identification technologies for such structures. A concept for integrating DNA-like clone-resistant building-structure identities together with tamper-proof, non-removable electronic unit is proposed. The resulting uniquely provable-structure-identity can be checked remotely allowing clone-resistant identification of a structure unit. We introduce possible attractive application scenarios of such secured identification in real world environment.

Pneumatic Formwork Systems in Structural Engineering,,,"Concrete as a construction material is characterized by high compressive strength, low tensile strength, and good casting ability. In order to fully utilize the potential of this material, the form of load-carrying structures has to be designed according to the stress distribution in the structure. Partially hollow structures, such as hollow beams, or doubly curved structures, such as shells, have favorable characteristics. In hollow structures, material savings are achieved in the individual building components by locally reducing dimensions. Concrete shells, if designed properly, are able to span over large areas by transferring the loads mainly by membrane stresses. The main problem with these structures, however, is the high effort required for producing the complicated formwork. One possibility of reducing this effort is to use a pneumatic formwork. This paper describes different pneumatic formwork systems invented in the past 100 years and presents the latest developments in this area. The many types of possible applications are divided into three categories in order to obtain a clearer overview. Finally, a new construction method, called ""Pneumatic Forming of Hardened Concrete (PFHC),"" is presented. This method was invented at the TU Vienna and uses the pneumatic formwork in a novel way.",2016
"Heterogeneous Materials Models, Coupled Mechanics-Probability Problems and Energetically Optimal Model Reduction",,BEHAVIOR; EQUATIONS; CONCRETE; FEM,"The main scientific goal of this chapter is to provide the sound theoretical basis and an efficient multi-scale computational algorithm for the description of irreversible behaviour of heterogeneous materials, through coupling of nonlinear mechanics and probability. Although we focus upon concrete as the most frequently used construction material, the proposed methodology applies to a number of other composite materials of interest for practical applications. The first main challenge pertains to providing the sound formulation for coupled nonlinear mechanics-probability computations for the prediction of failure and durability of a massive concrete structure. We show that the multi-scale interpretation of damage mechanisms can provide the most meaningful probability density description by identifying a limited number of the sources of uncertainty for material parameters governing the failure phenomena, which can be described in terms of random fields with a probability description computed from finer scales. The second main challenge is in providing an efficient solution procedure to this coupled mechanics-probability problem, which is done by using the Spectral Stochastic Finite Element Method (SSFEM). In particular, we seek to circumvent the main disadvantage of the classical SSFEM regarding the Curse of Dimension, where the coupled mechanics-probability problem dimension grows with a number of random fields. The proposed techniques include Low-Rank approaches and solution space reductions, with a rank-one update scheme based upon the variational formulation of the problem. However, since the resulting Low-Rank representation is not necessarily an optimal one with respect to the minimal energy at the given rank, we further extend this scheme to provide an optional solution space adaptation and the possibility to compute the energetically optimal reduced basis.",2016

The paper presents an experimental characterization on cement-matrix pastes doped with Carbon Nanotubes, Carbon Nanofibers, Carbon Black and Graphene Nanoplatelets. Both electro-mechanical and thermo-physical investigations have been carried out. The conductive nanoinclusions provide the cementitious matrix with piezoresistive properties allowing the detection of external strain and stress changes.

This paper focuses on the creation of Statistically Equivalent Periodic Unit Cells (SEPUC) to stochastically model protein bound composites for the purpose of creating FE models that provide insights into experimental results. Model inputs include the soil granulometry and volume fractions of the phases. Ellipsoidal particles are placed, and protein coatings and bridges are created, using a Level Set based Random Sequential Addition algorithm. Each image is assigned a statistical descriptor and a simple genetic algorithm is used to optimize for a statistical descriptor close to that of experimental specimens. The framework is validated by comparing experimental images of protein-bound soils obtained by micro-CT scanning with those obtained through the SEPUC framework.",2016
A New Microstructure Development Model for the Evaluation of Concrete Setting Time,,CRACKED CONCRETE; CEMENT PASTES; EARLY AGES; STRENGTH; HYDRATION; EVOLUTION,"Concrete is an exceptionally attractive construction material, with stable material supply, adequate fire resistance, and high durability. Its plasticity can be both an advantage and a disadvantage from an engineering point of view, providing versatile shapes via casting and hardening but also requiring a relatively long period of time to reach its design strength. The setting time, or hardening period, needed before the freshly poured concrete can carry a load, which begins once the hydration reaction has commenced, is a key parameter for durability since it directly affects cracking resistance in early-aged concrete. The new analysis technique for calculating setting time that was developed for this study utilizes both percolation theory and the strength development model. To verify the analytical results obtained using the new model, a critical volume ratio of hydrates was determined and a series of final setting times in concrete were experimentally investigated for different temperatures, mineral admixtures (FA: fly ash; GGBFS: ground granulated blast furnace slag), and a chemical admixture (superplasticizer). The results were found to be in good agreement with the model predictions, confirming its potential utility.",2016
Properties of Calcium Acetate Manufactured with Etching Waste Solution and Limestone Sludge as a Cementitious High-Early-Strength Admixture,,PORTLAND-CEMENT; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; HYDRATION; ACCELERATOR; ACTIVATION; CONCRETE; PASTES; ACID,"Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials. There are several methods available to improve its performance, with one of them being the use of high-early-strength admixtures (HESAs). Typical HESAs include calcium nitrate, calcium chloride, and calcium formate (CF). Industrial by-products, such as acetic acid and lime stone sludge (LSS), can be used together to produce calciumacetate (CA), which can subsequently be used as a cementitious HESA. In this study, calcium carbonate and LSS were mixed with cement in weight ratios of 1 : 1, 1 : 1.5, and 1 : 2, and the properties of the as-produced CA were evaluated. CA and CF were mixed with cement in different weight ratios (0, 1, 2, and 3 wt%) to obtain CA-and CF-mortars, respectively. The flow behavior, setting time, pH, and compressive strength of these mortars were evaluated, and their X-ray diffraction patterns were also analyzed. It was found that as the CF content in the CF-mortar increased, the initial strength of the mortar also increased. However, it impaired its long-term strength. On the other hand, when 1% CA was mixed with cement, satisfactory early and long-term strengths were achieved. Thus, CA, which is obtained from industrial by-products, can be an effective HESA.",2016

EFFECT OF LIMESTONE ON THE CEMENT PASTE HYDRATION IN THE PRESENCE OF POLYCARBOXYLATE SUPERPLASTICISER,Cement hydration; complex modulus; rheokenetics; addmixtures,SELF-CONSOLIDATING CONCRETE; RHEOLOGICAL BEHAVIOR; PORTLAND CEMENTS; YIELD-STRESS; MICROSTRUCTURE; PARAMETERS; SCC; ADMIXTURES; POWDER,"The addition of certain ingredients in conventional concrete is essential for improving rheological properties of this construction material. The effect of limestone and superplasticisers on the hydration kinetics of self-compacting concrete (SCC) was investigated on cement paste scale. These additives interact mostly with cement paste, since aggregates are considered to be inert materials. The understanding of the effect of these mineral and chemical additives on the hydration kinetics of cement paste is the key to design a self-compacting concrete with great properties. Four CEM I 52.5 N Portland Cements, limestone (LS) and one type of superplasticiser (SP) were used in this research. The hydration kinetics were evaluated by monitoring the storage modulus growth and different coefficients of a self-acceleration kinetics equation were used to depict the effect of different concentrations of SP with and without the optimum concentration of limestone (30%) on the hydration kinetics of cement pastes. It was observed that the rate of hydration increased with the increase in SP concentration depending on the cement used. The addition of limestone in the superplasticised cement paste significantly retarded the hydration kinetics for all four cements. The rheological behaviour of self-compacting cement paste was found to be very sensitive to the chemical and physical properties of the cements used.",2016
Cyclic behavior of various sands and structural materials interfaces,interface; sand; structural materials; cyclic direct shear test,DIRECT SHEAR TESTS; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; STRENGTH; FRICTION; SHAPE; PARTICLES; APPARATUS; STIFFNESS; MIXTURES,"This paper presents the results of an intensive experimental investigation on cyclic behavior of various sands and structural materials interface. Comprehensive measurements of the horizontal displacement and shear stresses developed during testing were performed using an automated constant normal load (CNL) cyclic direct shear test apparatus. Two different particle sizes (0.5 mm-0.25 mm and, 2.0 mm-1.0 mm) of sands having distinct shapes (rounded and angular) were tested in a cyclic direct shear testing apparatus at two vertical stress levels (sigma = 50 kPa, and 100 kPa) and two rates of displacement (R-D = 2.0 mm/min, and 0.025 mm/min) against various structural materials (i.e., steel, concrete, and wood). The cyclic direct shear tests performed during this investigation indicate that (i) the shear stresses developed during shearing highly depend on both the shape and size of sand grains; (ii) characteristics of the structural materials are closely related to interface response; and (iii) the rate of displacement is slightly effective on the results.",2016
Life Cycle Assessment and Optimization-Based Decision Analysis of Construction Waste Recycling for a LEED-Certified University Building,multi-criteria decision analysis; economic input-output analysis; life cycle assessment; construction waste management; LEED,SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENT; MANUFACTURING SECTORS; FRONTIER APPROACH; EMBODIED ENERGY; ASSESSMENT LCA; MANAGEMENT; IMPACTS; MODEL; WOOD,"The current waste management literature lacks a comprehensive LCA of the recycling of construction materials that considers both process and supply chain-related impacts as a whole. Furthermore, an optimization-based decision support framework has not been also addressed in any work, which provides a quantifiable understanding about the potential savings and implications associated with recycling of construction materials from a life cycle perspective. The aim of this research is to present a multi-criteria optimization model, which is developed to propose economically-sound and environmentally-benign construction waste management strategies for a LEED-certified university building. First, an economic input-output-based hybrid life cycle assessment model is built to quantify the total environmental impacts of various waste management options: recycling, conventional landfilling and incineration. After quantifying the net environmental pressures associated with these waste treatment alternatives, a compromise programming model is utilized to determine the optimal recycling strategy considering environmental and economic impacts, simultaneously. The analysis results show that recycling of ferrous and non-ferrous metals significantly contributed to reductions in the total carbon footprint of waste management. On the other hand, recycling of asphalt and concrete increased the overall carbon footprint due to high fuel consumption and emissions during the crushing process. Based on the multi-criteria optimization results, 100% recycling of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, cardboard, plastic and glass is suggested to maximize the environmental and economic savings, simultaneously. We believe that the results of this research will facilitate better decision making in treating construction and debris waste for LEED-certified green buildings by combining the results of environmental LCA with multi-objective optimization modeling.",2016
Fatigue resistance of reinforcing steel bars,low-cycle fatigue; reinforced concrete; model; reinforcing steel,,"During the last few years there has been an intensification of interest in the fatigue performance of steel reinforcement bars in concrete structures. Although fatigue has not proved to be a problem to date, loading cycles are becoming increasingly severe so that the margin of reserve strength is progressively being reduced. In this paper the authors present and discuss results of fatigue life tests performed for reinforcing steel bars which is one of the most widely used construction material in the world. Endurances can be influenced by type of steel, geometry and size of the bars, nature of the loading cycle, welding and presence of corrosion. The experimental part deals with fatigue testing of specimens for identification of the strain-life behaviour of reinforcing bars and determining the number of cycles to failure.

The aim of this paper is to determine the maximum replacement level of natural sand by recycled sand in the manufacturing of masonry mortar (M-10). For this purpose, five replacement levels were tested: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume. The mixes were made using cement CEM II/BL 32.5 N in a volumetric proportion of cement-to-aggregate of 1:5. A commercial admixture was used at a constant content. The amount of water was variable to achieve a consistency of 175 +/- 10 mm. The short-and long-term mortar properties were evaluated. The data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA. In conclusion, a maximum percentage of 50% recycled concrete sand can be used in an indoor environment.",2016
Embodied and operational energy of urban residential buildings in India,Embodied energy; Building materials; Process analysis; Input-output method,LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY; INPUT-OUTPUT-ANALYSIS; OFFICE BUILDINGS; CO2 EMISSION; CONSTRUCTION; HOUSES; CARBON; CONSUMPTION; JAPAN; NEED,"Globally, buildings consume nearly half of the total energy produced, and consequently responsible for a large share of CO2 emissions. A building's life cycle energy (LCE) comprises its embodied energy (EE) and operational energy (OE). The building design, prevalent climatic conditions and occupant behaviour primarily determines its LCE. Thus, for the identification of appropriate emission-reduction strategies, studies into building LCE are crucial. While OE reflects the energy utilized in operating a, EE comprises the initial capital energy involved in its construction (material and burden associated with material consumption in buildings. Assessment of EE and OE in buildings is crucial towards identifying appropriate design and operational strategies for reduction of the building's life cycle energy. This paper discusses EE and OE assessment of a few residential buildings in different climatic locations in India. The study shows that share of OE and EE in LCE greatly depends upon the types of materials used in construction and extent of space conditioning adopted. In some cases EE can exceed life cycle OE. Buildings with reinforced concrete frame and monolithic reinforced concrete walls have very high EE. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2016
Pre-use phase LCA of a multi-story residential building: Can greenhouse gas emissions be used as a more general environmental performance indicator?,Life cycle assessment; LCA; Construction; ReCiPe; Building; Environmental impact; Embodied emissions,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; CONSTRUCTION SECTOR; ASSESSMENT MODEL; EMBODIED ENERGY; HONG-KONG; CONCRETE,"Both the construction and use of buildings cause significant environmental pressures. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions imposed by buildings have been studied rather extensively, but less is known about other impacts. Still, climate change is only one harmful impact driven by buildings. Furthermore, no studies exist about how the other impacts are correlated with GHG emissions in the building context, and thus to what extent GHGs could be utilized as a more general environmental performance indicator. This paper fills these gaps by presenting a life cycle assessment of the pre-use phase of a modern concrete-element residential building with a very comprehensive life cycle inventory (LCI). The focus of the study is on the comparison of the accumulation of different environmental impacts relative to GHGs. The accumulation is analyzed from two perspectives common to building LCAs: building systems and different construction materials. The ReCiPe midpoint assessment method is utilized to reach wide impact category coverage. The study shows how GHGs act as a relatively good indicator for eight impact categories, but not for the others. The study also depicts that a very high coverage in the LCI must be reached to capture the majority of the different impacts. Many materials and building systems are considered non-relevant and are often excluded from building LCAs, which are in fact of great importance in many impact categories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Embodied carbon emissions of office building: A case study of China's 78 office buildings,CO2 emission; Life cycle assessment; Materialization; Office building,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; CONSTRUCTION; FUTURE; MITIGATION; SYSTEMS; SECTOR,"A CO2 emission in construction materialization stage is the key research point of architectural life cycle assessment, which is concentrated in emission time and in absolute emission Volume. To build a calculation model for CO2 emissions in the materialization stage of office buildings, it should take into consideration the CO2 emissions generated from production and transportation of construction materials and equipment as well as the CO2 emissions generated from the construction process. By this calculation model, the CO2 emissions are analyzed and calculated of 78 office buildings in construction materialization stage. On average, the CO2 emissions in construction materialization stage are 326.75 kg - CO2/m(2) 111; with the increase of building height, CO2 emissions per unit area increase significantly and the CO2 emissions per unit area of super-high-rise buildings are 1.5 times that of the multi-storey buildings; the CO2 emissions of Civil Engineering account for 75% of the whole construction materialization stage; And the carbon emissions of steel, concrete, mortar and wall materials reach over 80% of the Civil Engineering. The storeys of the building and the consumption of construction materials are taken as two independent variables to set up a prediction model for CO2 emissions of office buildings in materialization stage. By statistical analysis and comparison, it can be found that the prediction formula using steel reinforcement, concrete and wall materials as independent variables can better predicate CO2 emissions in the construction materialization stage.

Despite the massive amount of annual production worldwide, so far RHs have been recycled only for low-value applications. In recent years, many rice mills in rice producing countries have started using RH for the energy production for mill operations as well as household lighting in rural regions. Burning of RHs produces the rice husk ash (RHA). The disposal in landfills or open fields can be problematic and may cause a serious environmental and human health related problems due to the low bulk density of RHA. Several ways are being thought of for disposing RHA by making its commercial use. The amorphous silica forms the main component (83-90%) of RHA. The amorphous silica rich RHA has wide range of applications. High-value applications and current research investigations such as the use of RHA in manufacturing of silica gels, silicon chip, synthesis of activated carbon and silica, production of light weight construction materials and insulation, catalysts, zeolites, ingredients for lithium ion batteries, graphene energy storage/capacitor, carbon capture, and in drug delivery vehicles are presented. Use of RHA in potential future applications is also discussed. It is suggested that the amorphous silica rich RHA could become a potential resource of low cost precursor for the production of value-added silica based materials for practical applications.

In addition, the management of rapidly increasing construction and demolition (C&D) waste and waste glass is in serious concern due to the shortage of landfills and associated environmental burdens for landfill disposal. Concrete paving eco-blocks using recycled materials derived from locally generated C&D waste and waste glass have been developed in Hong Kong and achieved its current advanced form with the continuous improvement. Therefore, this study aims to assess and compare the environmental impacts and sustainability associated with the natural blocks manufactured with virgin materials and three generations of the eco-blocks manufactured with recycled C&D waste and waste glass by the lifecycle assessment (LCA) techniques. For evaluating the environmental performance of concrete paving blocks, the IMPACT 2002+ method was used for lifecycle impact assessment with the functional unit of 1 t of blocks production. This study considered the ""cradle-to-site"" system boundary, which includes raw material extraction/production, raw material collection and transport to blocks manufacturing site, blocks manufacturing, and transport of the produced blocks to use sites. First-hand data were collected from a local eco-block manufacturer. Sensitivity analysis was conducted for different raw material inputs to investigate the variation of the results. The findings demonstrated that as compared to the natural blocks, the eco-blocks consumed 26-32 % lower energy, emitted 17-20 % lower greenhouse gases (GHG) in CO2 eq. as global warming potential, 22-29 % lower SO2 eq. as acidification potential, and 20-26 % lower PM2.5 eq. as respiratory inorganics potential, depending on the types of eco-blocks. The proposed manufacturing process has the higher savings for all impacts categories for the eco-blocks. In addition, second generation eco-blocks induced the lowest impacts compared to other two types of eco-blocks. In summary, the eco-blocks have significant environmental gains which could help minimize the waste management problem, reduce natural resource depletion, and promote green consumption. The paper provides a method to facilitate the construction industry to choose sustainable materials to minimize environmental damages and promote the sustainable management of wastes. In addition to establishing a basis for choosing materials, the paper compares alternative manufacturing processes of concrete paving blocks for promoting green construction.",2016
Fragility curves for structures under tsunami loading,Fragility curves; Damage state; Inundation depth; Construction material; Monte Carlo simulation; Failure criterion,SRI-LANKA; DAMAGE,"Susceptibility to structural damage can be characterized by a fragility curve, which is expressed as a normal or lognormal cumulative distribution of the conditional probabilities of reaching or exceeding a particular damage state, for given values of the demand parameter. Such curves have been produced for a variety of damage states in different categories of buildings exposed to tsunami loading in different parts of the world, with the demand parameter taken as inundation depth. Harmonization was sought across these studies with respect to the median inundation depth. Three categories of single-storey buildings were identified based on construction material, namely reinforced concrete, masonry and timber. The median inundation depths for the complete damage state decreased from reinforced concrete (5.4-7.3 m) through masonry (2.3-2.5 m) to timber (similar to 1.6 m) structures. The fairly narrow ranges above represent a number of different studies and indicate that a common family of curves or ""bands"" can be arrived at. Such ranges were identified for other partial damage states too. Our genuinely original contribution is a probabilistic model that was developed using a Monte Carlo simulation to produce synthetic fragility functions for masonry and reinforced concrete structures under tsunami loading. The probabilistic model consisted of a geometric model that captured the geometrical and wall-type variations of the building lot, a loading function and a set of failure criteria, all of which required appropriate simplifying assumptions. The resulting synthetic fragility curves matched the fragility curves based on observed tsunami damage for the complete collapse damage state reasonably well.",2016

This study is related to the development of bio-based composites and the determination of their thermal, mechanical and acoustical insulation properties. The composites were prepared using corn stalk particles as the reinforcement components. An experimental design was established to study the effect of the stalk particle size and the epoxy/corn stalk particle ratio on the thermal and mechanical properties of the composites prepared. Their mechanical properties and thermal performance characteristics are compared with the commercially available bio-based insulation materials. This study shows that waste corn-on-the-cob can be used for the reinforcement of epoxy resin to prepare insulation materials that can be used commercially. Natural products of high insulating value can be obtained that can provide alternative insulation materials and reduce the import of insulation materials and satisfy the criteria of the Turkish Standard TS 805 EN 601. The results of this study can solve two industrial problems. One of them is providing a new useful construction material and the other is utilizing agricultural wastes to reduce their harm to the environment. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2016
Study of improving the thermal response of a construction material containing a phase change material,,ENERGY STORAGE; BUILDING APPLICATIONS; PCM; WALLBOARDS,"The use of phase change materials (PCMs) for improving the thermal comfort in buildings has become an attractive application.

An investigation of CaSi silica fume characteristics and its possible utilization in cement-based and alkali-activated materials,CaSi silica fume; Characterization; Mechanical behavior; Rheological behavior; Alkaline activation,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; FLY-ASH; RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; HARDENED PROPERTIES; UNBURNED CARBON; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; PASTES; ADMIXTURES; VISCOSITY,"This paper presents a comparison between Si silica fume (a by-product of silicon metal or ferrosilicon alloys) used in civil engineering applications and CaSi silica fume (a by-product of calcium-silicon alloys). Si silica fume has been recognized as being a by-product of more importance to the concrete industry. A lot of studies have looked at its properties and at how it can contribute to the improvements in fresh and hardened concrete. On the contrary, few papers have been published on CaSi silica fume. Chemical, mineralogical and physical characteristics are analyzed here. Rheological and mechanical behaviors of cement pastes and mortars composed of Si and CaSi silica fume are also studied in order to observe the effect of CaSi silica fume as cement replacement. The results show that these two types of silica fume do not affect in the same way the fresh and hardened properties of cementitious materials. Replacing a part of cement by CaSi silica fume does not improve the compressive strength as Si silica fume does but a good rheological behavior is maintained. To complete this work, the alkaline activation of 100%CaSi silica fume mortars is investigated. These preliminary results show that this by-product is worth to be studied and lead us to believe that it could be used in construction materials. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015
An assessment of the relationship between embodied and thermal energy demands in dwellings in a Mediterranean climate,Embodied energy; Final thermal energy demand; Primary thermal energy consumption; Construction materials; Residential building,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; SYSTEM BOUNDARY; EMISSIONS; CERTIFICATION; MODEL,"Currently, climate change has become a research priority. In many countries, new regulations have emerged with the aim of reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions. In this work, 92 sub-scenarios were evaluated in a case study building. The final goal was to obtain the relationship between the thermal energy demand and the initial embodied energy (LEE) when a change was made in the building typology, taking into consideration ten different facades, three roofing systems, and three window frame types. The results showed that the use of injected polyurethane or extruded polystyrene in facades, and the replacement of timber in window frames by lacquered aluminium, provided increases of the primary IEE equivalent to the final heating energy requirements of a detached house for more than 5 and 10 years, respectively. The insulation of thermal bridges at the junction of external walls and concrete floor slabs caused increases in the primary IEE, which were observed to be within 1.17 and 12 times lower than the final annual heating requirements of the building when not insulated. Finally, an estimation of the primary thermal energy requirements was made, taking into account three different energy systems and a 50-year building lifetime. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

UTILIZATION OF OIL-CONTAMINATED CLAYS AS CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS,compressive strength; geopolymer; oil contaminated clay; strength activity index,FLY-ASH; GEOPOLYMERS; CONCRETE; SOIL,"The objective of this study is to manufacture a geopolymer by replacing part of the metakaolinite by calcined oil-contaminated clay (OCC) and investigate its properties. The effects of the calcination temperature, the mix design of the alkali activator, and the degree of calcined OCC replacement on the properties of the geopolymer were studied. Evaluation of pozzolanic activity and compressive strength as well as micro structure observation by SEM and XRD were performed in this study. The results indicate the best strength activity index (SAI) was obtained that when OCC was calcined at 850 degrees C. The concentration of alkali activator needed to manufacture the geopolymer decreased with increasing degrees of calcined OCC replacement. It was found that 25% calcined OCC replacement could efficiently improve the early compressive strength of geopolymer specimens. However, with more than 75% calcined OCC replacement, the late strength of the geopolymer specimens decreased. Microstructural observation showed similar results in that the amount of silicon was not sufficient for polymerization and the chemical bonding was reduced at greater degrees of calcined OCC replacement. As a result, the late compressive strength of geopolymer specimens was insufficiently developed.",2015
Analysis of chromium and sulphate origins in construction recycled materials based on leaching test results,Environmental management; Construction materials; Leaching assessment; Chromium; Sulphate,DEMOLITION WASTE; CONCRETE; AGGREGATE; CEMENT; IMMOBILIZATION; INDUSTRY; ROADS; SLAG,"Twenty samples of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition waste (CDW) with different compositions collected at six recycling plants in the Andalusia region (south of Spain) were characterised according to the Landfill Directive criteria. Chromium and sulphate were identified as the most critical compounds in the leachates. To detect the sources of these two pollutant constituents in recycled aggregate, environmental assessments were performed on eight construction materials (five unused ceramic materials, two old crushed concretes and one new mortar manufactured in the laboratory). The results confirmed that leached sulphate and Cr were mainly released by the ceramic materials (bricks and tiles). To predict the toxicological consequences, the oxidation states of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) were measured in the leachates of recycled aggregates and ceramic materials classified as non-hazardous. The bricks and tiles mainly released total Cr as Cr (III). However, the recycled aggregates classified as non-hazardous according to the Landfill Directive criteria mainly released Cr (VI), which is highly leachable and extremely toxic. The obtained results highlight the need for legislation that distinguishes the oxidative state in which chromium is released into the environment. Leaching level regulations must not be based solely on total Cr, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved,",2015
Remedial processing of oil shale fly ash (OSFA) and its value-added conversion into glass-ceramics,Glass-ceramics; Heavy metal; Melting; Oil shale fly ash; Sintering,BOTTOM ASH; CRYSTALLIZATION; SLUDGE; WASTE; MICROSTRUCTURE; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR; REUSE; SLAG,"Recently, various solid wastes such as sewage sludge, coal fly ash and slag have been recycled into various products such as sintered bricks, ceramics and cement concrete. Application of these recycling approaches is much better and greener than conventional landfills since it can solve the problems of storage of industrial wastes and reduce exploration of natural resources for construction materials to protect the environment. Therefore, in this study, an attempt was made to recycle oil shale fly ash (OSFA), a by-product obtained from the extracting of shale oil in the oil shale industry, into a value-added glass-ceramic material via melting and sintering method. The influence of basicity (CaO/SiO2 ratio) by adding calcium oxide on the performance of glass-ceramics was studied in terms of phase transformation, mechanical properties, chemical resistances and heavy metals leaching tests. Crystallization kinetics results showed that the increase of basicity reduced the activation energies of crystallization but did not change the crystallization mechanism. When increasing the basicity from 0.2 to 0.5, the densification of sintering body was enhanced due to the promotion of viscous flow of glass powders, and therefore the compression strength and bending strength of glass-ceramics were increased. Heavy metals leaching results indicated that the produced OSFA-based glass-ceramics could be taken as non-hazardous materials. The maximum mechanical properties of compression strength of 186 +/- 3 MPa, bending strength of 78 6 MPa, good chemical resistances and low heavy metals leaching concentrations showed that it could be used as a substitute material for construction applications. The proposed approach will be one of the potential sustainable solutions in reducing the storage of oil shale fly ash as well as converting it into a value-added product. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study reports on measurements of microclimate data taken in different open urban spaces such as parks, squares and courtyards featuring various ground surface materials, in particular asphalt, concrete, marble, granite, porous stone, cobble stone, ceramic tiles, gravel, grass and water. The measured data were used to assess the effect of morphologic features and material properties on microclimate development. Measurements were taken in two stages, starting with exploratory readings followed by corrective and complementary measurements. These took place in six different sites in the city of Thessaloniki, in northern Greece. The measurements include surface and ambient temperatures, relative humidity and wind velocity readings. Spot measurements of direct and reflected solar radiation were also taken for an indicative calculation of surface albedo. The second round of measurements included globe temperatures in order to estimate the effect of the radiant environment on pedestrian thermal comfort. The results show differences between and within open spaces and their surfaces, thus highlighting the effects of shading, vegetation, water and material properties on microclimate development and pedestrian thermal comfort.

"Davis Wade Stadium Expansion and Renovation: Performance of Concrete Produced with Portland-Limestone Cement, Fly Ash, and Slag Cement",Stadiums; Sustainable development; Portland cement; Limestone construction materials; Concrete construction; Concrete fly ash slag cement,,"This paper documents successful use of portland-limestone cement (PLC) with 50% replacement of cement using supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) during expansion and renovation of a college football stadium. Concrete becomes more sustainable as clinker content is reduced, and use of PLC in place of ordinary portland cement (OPC), e.g., such as per a common U.S. national standard, has considerable appeal, especially if performance tradeoffs that are often associated with more sustainable concrete can be addressed. Higher replacement of cement in concrete with SCMs may also be possible by incorporating PLC, further adding value to projects from performance and sustainability perspectives. Concrete containing PLC was successfully used in approximately 1,900 m(3) of on-grade and structural concrete flatwork. The cementitious system contained 50% PLC, 30% slag cement, and 20% Class C fly ash. This paper provides information related to properties of the PLC supplied to the stadium project as they are not necessarily typical of PLCs used worldwide over the past several years. One especially beneficial performance trend was that early-age strength gain of concrete containing 50% PLC, 30% slag cement, and 20% Class C fly ash was noticeably better than that of otherwise comparable concrete containing OPC. Additionally, use of PLC did not result in finishing problems, reduced slump by approximately 20 mm, reduced set time by approximately 1 h, and improved chloride ion resistance.

The first phase was dominated by steel. During this phase, revolutionary steel bridges were constructed. This happened despite the fact that steel was not manufactured in this region. The use of structural steel in these bridges exploited its advantageous properties of economically carrying heavy loads over long spans with minimum dead weight. After this phase, the choice of material used in bridges changed to concrete. During the past 20 years, steel has staged a strong comeback. The aim of this paper is to explain why the bridge industry has experienced different phases in construction. Selected case studies of vehicle and foot steel bridges are presented and discussed to substantiate the competitiveness of steel as a bridge construction material.",2015
Development of fly ash-based composite binder and its application in construction materials,metakaolin; hydration; compressive strength; porosity; fly ash,POZZOLANIC REACTION; PORTLAND-CEMENT; MICROSTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT; PART II; METAKAOLIN; SYSTEMS; STRENGTH; ACTIVATION; HYDRATION; GEOPOLYMERS,"The effect of addition of metakaolin on hydration and physico-chemical properties of fly ash composite binder prepared by blending 50-60% fly ash with hydrated lime sludge, Portland cement and gypsum plaster were investigated. The metakaolin has a beneficial effect on the properties of composite binder by reducing its porosity and pore diameter with curing period which are responsible for the attainment of high strength and better stability towards water over the composite binder without metakaolin. The strength development in composite binder takes place due to the hydration of gypsum plaster to gypsum and pozzolanic reaction of fly ash, metakaolin with lime and alkali in cement thereby forming ettringite, tobermorite and C(4)AH(13). The reaction products formed during the hydration were confirmed by X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The composite binder has low heat of hydration and is found suitable for use in masonry works, concrete and bricks.",2015

The material characteristics indicate potential for various applications: in small dosages as raw feed in Portland cement production, as fine and filler aggregates, or in ground form as cement component, with manageable effects on performance. Using manufactured SSA aggregate, concrete strength suitable for structural applications and lightweight properties comparable to Leca are attainable. SSA can be used in bulk, in controlled low strength materials (CLSM), aerated and foamed concretes. Reported case studies give encouraging signals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015
Cementitiuous materials for crack self-healing concrete,Self-healing; Crack; Durability; Crack-free Concrete; Repair,COMPOSITES; IONS,"The serviceability and durability of concrete structures has been extensively studied by various researchers. Cementitious materials and concrete are the most widely used in construction site. However, cracking is a well-known phenomenon in concrete engineering. Concrete repairs are inevitable to enhance its service life which evokes additional expenditure separate to the building cost. Therefore, one of the most important issues is to seal cracks which occur due to drying shrinkage or exposed to external factors. Many researchers have already studied this topic with the intent to control cracking or develop a crack-free concrete. Two alternatives for crack control have been proposed; these include methodologies for either controlling residual stresses or developing ductile concrete. Recently, a lot of researchers are studied various crack control methods and concepts to achieve self-healing phenomenon in past decades. In this review paper, autogenous healing in cementitious materials is reported based on various articles, activity of JCI TC-075B (Japan Concrete Institute Technical Committee 075B), JCI TC-091A (Japan Concrete Institute Technical Committee 091A) and RILEM TC-SHC (Self-healing Phenomena in Cement Based Materials of (International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems and Structures)).",2015
IS THORON A PROBLEM IN SWEDISH DWELLINGS? RESULTS OF MEASUREMENTS OF CONCENTRATIONS OF THORON AND ITS PROGENY,,DECAY PRODUCTS; RADON,"Long-term measurements of thoron progeny concentrations (equilibrium-equivalent thoron concentration) have been carried out in Swedish dwellings with the aim of investigating if thoron and its progeny pose a health risk. Measurements were performed in 93 houses and 25 apartments. In addition to thoron progeny concentration, thoron gas concentration near the wall surface, ambient dose equivalent rate of gamma radiation and radon gas concentration were also measured. The results show that the mean value of thoron progeny was 2.2 Bq m(-3) in houses and 1.6 Bq m(-3) in apartments. Ten per cent of the dwellings (both houses and apartments) had thoron progeny concentrations exceeding 10 Bq m(-3). Thoron progeny concentration is not significantly different in dwellings built of alum shale-based aerated concrete ('blue concrete') than dwellings built of other construction materials. For the dwellings in this study (not representative of the Swedish population), the mean dose estimated due to exposure to thoron was found to be 0.4 mSv y(-1).",2015
FRP versus traditional strengthening on a typical mid-rise Turkish RC building,seismic retrofit; FRP strengthening; RC jacketing; confinement effect; deformation capacity,FIBER-REINFORCED POLYMER; STRESS-STRAIN MODEL; COMPOSITE JACKETED CONCRETE; CYCLIC AXIAL-COMPRESSION; CONFINED CONCRETE; UNIAXIAL COMPRESSION; T-BEAMS; COLUMNS; BEHAVIOR; SHEETS,"This paper investigates the limits and efficacies of the Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) material for strengthening mid-rise RC buildings against seismic actions. Turkey, the region of the highest seismic risk in Europe, is chosen as the case-study country, the building stock of which consists in its vast majority of mid-rise RC residential and/or commercial buildings. Strengthening with traditional methods is usually applied in most projects, as ordinary construction materials and no specialized workmanship are required. However, in cases of tight time constraints, architectural limitations, durability issues or higher demand for ductile performance, FRP material is often opted for since the most recent Turkish Earthquake Code allows engineers to employ this advanced-technology product to overcome issues of inadequate ductility or shear capacity of existing RC buildings. The paper compares strengthening of a characteristically typical mid-rise Turkish RC building by two methods, i.e., traditional column jacketing and FRP strengthening, evaluating their effectiveness with respect to the requirements of the Turkish Earthquake Code. The effect of FRP confinement is explicitly taken into account in the numerical model, unlike the common procedure followed according to which the demand on un-strengthened members is established and then mere section analyses are employed to meet the additional demands.",2015
Chloride Electroremediation in reinforced structures: preliminary electrochemical tests to detect the steel repassivation during the treatment,Electroremediation; Electrochemical Chloride Extraction; Nondestructive techniques,CONCRETE STRUCTURES; CONTAMINATED CONCRETE; CORROSION RATE; REMOVAL; EXTRACTION; POLARIZATION; EFFICIENCY; MODEL; RECOMMENDATION; REPAIR,"Application of electroremediation techniques in concrete is being increasingly used not only to remove different harmful pollutants from the cement matrix, but also for the reduction of different substances that provoke undesirable reactions in the material, as could be chlorides inducing corrosion or efflorescence in construction materials. Electrochemical chloride extraction (ECE) in concrete has aroused great interest in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in this type of techniques and has been massively used in laboratory experiments. However, there is an important need to develop new techniques to detect the exact moment at which the rebar is repassivated, or in other words, the moment at which the treatment has been finished. The usual methods to control the electroremediation efficiency involve extraction and chemical analysis (chloride ions) of cores from the structure. Electrochemical techniques applied to the corrosion rate quantification, I-corr, by the Polarization Resistance technique, R-p, are the suggested nondestructive indicators of the efficiency of the technique at the end of the treatment, but it is not possible to use these parameters as passivity indicators during the treatment. In this work, the ECE treatment has been monitored through different electrochemical techniques: accumulated electric charge density (sigma), instant off potentials (E-off), polarized and depolarized potentials (E-pol, E-dep), and Polarization Resistance measurements (R-p) registered during the treatment (current off and current on), electrolyte resistivity measurements (R-x), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), comparing the on-site results with the final results obtained after destructively analyzing the results of the ECE treatment. From these preliminary results, a resistivity index R-x/R-initial in which initial resistivity (R-initial) and resistivity values taken along the treatment (R-x) are considered to evaluate the treatment progression. Apart from this, the polarized steel potentials seem to postulate as feasible convenient indicators of the repassivation of the steels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015
Comparison of generic and product-specific Life Cycle Assessment databases: application to construction materials used in building LCA studies,Building assessment; Comparison; Construction products; EPD; Generic data; LCA,,"The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been applied in the construction sector since the 1990s and is now more and more embedded in European public policies, e.g., for Environmental Product Declaration regulation or for building labeling schemes. As far as the authors know, these initiatives mainly rely on background impact data of building products provided by different databases' providers. The new product-specific and company-specific EPD data allow having more than one data for describing a building material. But are these new databases really displaying similar LCA results compared to generic databases? Does it depend on which impact category (e.g., global warming, acidification, toxicity) is considered? To answer these research questions, this paper assesses numerical and methodological differences of two existing LCA databases for building LCAs: the ecoinvent generic database and one Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) database developed in France. After reviewing the main assumptions of these databases, numerical values of environmental impact are compared for 28 building materials using Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) indicators of the EN 15804 standard calculated based on cradle-to-gate ecoinvent and EPD Life Cycle Inventories (LCI). Global results at the database level indicate deviations of different magnitudes depending on the LCIA indicators and the building materials. While indicators correlated to fossil fuel consumption, such as the ADP, the GWP, and the primary energy demand, exhibit a small deviation (approximately 25 %), other indicators, such as the photochemical ozone formation (POCP), radioactive waste, and ADP elements, are found to be more variable between EPD and generic data (sometimes by more than 100 %). Three indicators are found to be systematically different between EPD and generic data (i.e., the EPD value being either higher or lower for all materials). Similarly, five building materials show systematic differences for all LCIA indicators. Specific deviations for one indicator and one material are also reported. The application of the two databases on three building LCA case studies (brick, reinforced concrete, and timber frame structures) identifies deviations due to the most influential materials. Current generic and EPD databases can present very different values at the database scale which depend on the type of environmental indicator. For building LCA results, the situation is different as generally speaking a limited number of materials controlled the impacts. Finally, recommendations are presented for each environmental indicator to improve the consistency of the building assessment from generic to product- and country-specific information.",2015
Characterization of concrete failure behavior: a comprehensive experimental database for the calibration and validation of concrete models,3-Point bending; Brazilian splitting; Size effect; Cohesive fracture; Softening; Single notch tension,SHEAR LATTICE MODEL; TUBE-SQUASH TEST; MICROPLANE MODEL; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; PARTICLE MODEL; FRACTURE TESTS; BRAZILIAN TEST; CRACK-GROWTH; DAMAGE; COMPRESSION,"Concrete is undoubtedly the most important and widely used construction material of the late twentieth century. Yet, mathematical models that can accurately capture the particular material behavior under all loading conditions of significance are scarce at best. Although concepts and suitable models have existed for quite a while, their practical significance is low due to the limited attention to calibration and validation requirements and the scarcity of robust, transparent and comprehensive methods to perform such tasks. In addition, issues such as computational cost, difficulties associated with calculating the response of highly nonlinear systems, and, most importantly, lack of comprehensive experimental data sets have hampered progress in this area. This paper attempts to promote the use of advanced concrete models by (a) providing an overview of required tests and data preparation techniques; and (b) making a comprehensive set of concrete test data, cast from the same batch, available for model development, calibration, and validation. Data included in the database 'http://www.baunat.boku.ac.at/cd-labor/downloads/versuchsdaten' comprise flexure tests of four sizes, direct tension tests, confined and unconfined compression tests, Brazilian splitting tests of five sizes, and loading and unloading data.

"Geotechnical study of marble, schist, and granite as dimension stone: a case study from parts of Lesser Himalaya, Neelum Valley Area, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan",Dimension stone; Physical and mechanical properties; Lesser Himalaya; Neelum Valley area; Petrography,,"Extensive production of concrete and bricks has reduced the use of stone masonry in construction. The overwhelming use of artificial material, especially concrete, has led to many environmental issues. Use of dimension stone is almost non-existent in general construction. Nonetheless, it is still widely adopted in foundations, facings, dams, coastal defenses, and retaining and water containment structures. For the possible rational replacement of artificial materials, marble, schist, and granite were selected for evaluation as dimension stones. Important properties influencing the behaviour of construction material, such as compressive strength, tensile strength, durability, water absorption, and petrography, were investigated on selected rocks. The results were correlated with standard specifications of ASTM, ISO 14689-1 (Geotechnical investigation and testing. Identification and classification of rock. Part 1: Identification and description 1-16, 2003) and Gamble durability index (1971). Regional faults, Main Boundary Thrust, and Panjal Thrust, present in the area influence the characteristics of rocks adversely. Granite has a lower compressive strength than the ASTM specification so it should be avoided for load-bearing masonry units and external pavements. Granites and marbles have a higher degree of water absorption. All three rock units have a very high degree of polish, so their use as decorative stone, especially as internal flooring and at internal walls, is highly recommended.",2015
Modelling and simulation of earthquake resistant 3D woven textile structural concrete composites,3-Dimensional reinforcement; Ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs); Elasticity; Finite element analysis (FEA),PACKING DENSITY; NANOCOMPOSITES,"Concrete is a composite material composed of water, sand, coarse granular material called aggregate and cement that fills the space among the aggregate particles and glues them together. Conventional building structures are made up of steel skeleton with concrete impregnation. These are very heavy weight structures with steel vulnerable to corrosion. The conventional concrete structures tend to undergo large deformations in the event of a strong earthquake. Mechanical simulation of various textile structural concretes is carried out successfully for their ductility behaviour. 3D woven reinforced concretes display superior ductile character showing ray of hope to develop seismic resistant building. Simulation of three 3D woven fabrics and their composites was carried to predict ductility and strengths of fabric reinforced concrete structures. Maximum deformation was observed for beam reinforced with orthogonal interlock fabric under the same load and minimum deformation was observed for plain concrete. Maximum equivalent stress was observed to be highest for plain concrete followed by beam reinforced with angle interlock fabric followed by orthogonal fabric and warp interlock fabric under similar loading conditions. From the results it was clear that 3D fabric reinforced structures are more ductile than the traditional steel reinforced structures. Hence 3D fabric reinforced concrete structures are much better in strength and ductility as compared to conventional construction materials. Among the three 3D fabric, orthogonal fabric reinforced composites are most ductile and are also less stiff. They can deform more than the other two fabric composites. Hence, orthogonal fabric reinforced composites can undergo higher deformations without collapsing. These composites can be more elastic under earthquake shaking. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, modified models by metaheuristic optimization algorithms to present approaches with higher performance may be of special interest In this work, support vector machine (SVM) is utilized to predict compressive strength of geopolymers, cement-free eco-friendly construction materials. Parameters of SVM are sometimes hard to be found especially in the case of complex models. Therefore, task of finding these parameters was followed by five different well-known optimization algorithms including genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSOA), ant colony optimization algorithm (ACOA), artificial bee colony optimization algorithm (ABCOA) and imperialist competitive algorithm (ICOA). Results of these five hybrid models were compared by a model using just SVM, and other traditional artificial intelligence techniques namely artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy interfacial systems (ANFIS). A total number of 1347 data were collected from the literature for modelling. It was suggested that hybrid models can be appropriately used for modelling of compressive strength of geopolymer paste, mortar and concrete specimens. By evaluating the proposed models through their coefficient of determination and errors, it was concluded that ICOA and GA are more suitable to optimize parameters of SVM for predicting compressive strength of the considered geopolymers. Additionally, ANN model was remained as one of the simplest approaches which can be used with reasonable accuracy for the problem of this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Statistical analysis of embodied carbon emission for building construction,Embodied carbon; Building materials; Descriptive statistics; Correlation; Goodness-of-fit,LIFE-CYCLE; ENERGY MEASUREMENT; SYSTEM BOUNDARY,"Buildings are significant contributors to the greenhouse effect through emission of considerable carbon dioxide during their life cycle. Life cycle carbon resulting from buildings consists of two components: operational carbon (OC) and embodied carbon (EC). Recent studies have shown the growing significance of EC because much effort has already been invested into reducing OC. In this context, it is important to estimate and reduce EC. Because of the variability and uncertainty contained in a range of conditions, the EC of building needs to be calculated based on probabilistic analysis. This study identifies and analyzes the statistical characteristics of EC emitted from building construction materials. It was aimed at buildings constructed of reinforced concrete and nine representative construction materials. Descriptive statistics analysis, correlation analysis, and a goodness-of-fit test were performed to describe the statistical characteristics of EC. In addition, a case study was carried out to show the difference between the deterministic and probabilistic estimations. Presenting statistical information on EC data and the differences between the deterministic and probabilistic values, the result shows the necessity and reasonability of the probabilistic method for EC estimation.

Reuse of base-metal tailings as aggregates for rendering mortars: Assessment of immobilization performances and environmental behavior,Tailings management; Tailings-based mortars; Leaching tests; Metals immobilization,MINE TAILINGS; FROTH FLOTATION; COPPER TAILINGS; ABANDONED MINE; CONCRETE; MOROCCO; WASTES; LEAD; DESULFURIZATION; MECHANISMS,"The management of mine tailings has become a worldwide environmental concern. In essence, with the increasing ecological disruptions related to tailings storage facilities, there is a pressing need to develop sustainable alternative methods for the management of these hazardous materials. In parallel, abandoned base-metal tailings that contain residual metals are increasingly used in some developing countries as aggregate for mortars without any control or environmental concern. Consequently, there is an additional necessity for improved knowledge of tailings eco-compatibility when reused as construction material. This paper approaches these issues by assessing the geochemical behavior and immobilization performances of two low sulfide tailings-based mortars, commonly used in the upper-Moulouya region (eastern Morocco) as surface finishing mortars. The mechanical and durability performances of these mortars were also presented to endorse their reuse potential. The obtained results showed firstly that the reuse of base-metal tailings with low sulfide content and relatively minor residual-metal concentrations (As approximate to 30 mg/kg, Cr approximate to 60 mg/kg, Pb approximate to 4500 mg/kg, Zn approximate to 250 mg/kg) generates mortars with good mechanical and durability performances. Additionally, all leaching tests results (batch test, acid neutralization analysis, selective dissolution, tank leaching test and weathering cell test) indicated that risks of metals release from tailings-based mortars are minor and their reuse as surface finishing renders may constitute a sustainable alternative method for efficient tailings management.

"Mechanical and microstructural features of autoclaved aerated concrete reinforced with autoclaved polypropylene, carbon, basalt and glass fiber",Autoclaved aerated concrete; Carbon fiber; Polypropylene fiber; Basalt fiber; Glass fiber; Compressive strength; Flexural strength; Microstructure,,"Autoclaved aerated concrete (MC) is a construction material obtained by being pore-forming of the mixture prepared with finely crushed siliceous aggregate lime, water and limestone with the addition of aluminum powder and being cured with steam cure (autoclave). MC is a widely used material today in the constructions as a material that is very light compared to concrete or conventional stone material and that has high insulation properties and fire-resistant light construction material. In this study, the effect of fiber type and size in the production of MC on compressive, flexural strength and thermal conductivity values has been investigated. In the study, G2/04 class having 400 kg/m(3) density of MC production used for wall element and commercially produced was taken as a reference. Fiber types were substituted for an equal amount of aggregate and MC samples were produced. The mechanical properties and thermal conductivity values as well as microstructural features of the sample produced were examined. The samples produced were waited at the temperature of 60 degrees C in 4 h-cure, then they were subjected to the cure at the temperature of 180 degrees C, at the pressure of 11 bar and in an autoclave for 6.5 h. As well as the mechanical properties of the samples produced and thermal conductivity values, their microstructural features were also examined. In the study, it was seen that fiber was supplemented instead of quartzite increased flexural and compressive strength of MC and carbon fiber reinforced MC gave the best flexural and compressive strength compared to fiber types.

Earthen construction materials: Assessing the feasibility of improving strength and deformability of compressed earth blocks using polypropylene fibers,Sustainable structural materials; Earthen masonry; Fiber reinforcement; Compressed earth blocks; Ductility,CEMENT; SOIL; REINFORCEMENT; SHRINKAGE; BEHAVIOR; MASONRY,"Earthen construction materials are often ecologically friendly and locally available. They are however weaker and poor in damage resilience compared to mainstream walling materials like fired bricks and concrete masonry units (CMU). Compressed earth blocks (CEB), a modern form of the adobe brick, are gaining popularity as a construction material globally because they are stronger and more dimensionally stable compared to earlier forms of earthen construction methods/techniques. Despite the strength improvement achieved through using CEBs over other traditional forms of earthen construction, they are still more brittle and weaker in bending and compression in comparison to CMU and fired bricks. This research investigated the potential of addressing some of the shortcomings of earthen construction materials by assessing the influence of polypropylene fibers on the strength, ductility, and deformability of CEBs. CEBs were produced using different fiber weight fractions and tested in both compression and bending. Overall, performance in bending and ductility were improved by the addition of fibers. The quantity of fibers present was found to have an influence on block strength, post-crack response, and deformability. The findings presented in this paper suggest that polypropylene fibers are a feasible fiber option for CEB production. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015

Population growth and improved road accessibility has led to increased construction and an expansion and alteration of the built environment. The growing availability of modern construction materials like concrete and steel allows for new architectural designs and the erection of additional storeys on existing buildings, which contributes to the instability of the building stock. The aftermath of the April 2015 Gorkha Earthquake demonstrates the severe consequences of such haphazard construction practices in seismically active locations. A lack of implementation and enforcement of regulatory frameworks for building construction and spatial planning raises the risks for the local population. Taking Musikot as a characteristic case study of rapid urban change, this article analyses it's increasing local earthquake-risk in light of insufficient seismic building code implementation and risk-sensitive urban planning. Applying an approach that combines repeat photography and field mapping, the urban development of Musikot and the increasing fragility of the building stock are assessed using a modified seismic evaluation scheme for local building types. Almost one fourth of all construction was found to be at high risk of damage to earthquakes. It is argued, that without proper training in earthquake resistant construction techniques and awareness campaigns, the (mal-)adoption of modern construction materials will amplify earthquake risk in rural centres. This study stresses the need to broaden the research of disaster risk reduction and adequate adaptation strategies beyond the current focus on large agglomerations to include rapidly urbanising small settlements in rural areas, which are all too often neglected.",2015
Monitoring of sulphate attack on hardened cement paste studied by synchrotron XRD,Cement paste; Sulphate attack; Mineral additions; Concentration; Monitoring,PORTLAND-CEMENT; MORTAR BARS; CONCRETE; MECHANISM; FRESH; DIFFRACTION; CARBONATION; EXPANSION; HYDRATION; GYPSUM,"The complex matter of external sulphate attack on cement-based construction materials is still not completely understood. The concentration of sulphate is a crucial factor for the formation of secondary phases and phase transitions of cement hydrates due to sulphate ingress into the microstructure. The sulphate attack on building materials for high and low sulphate concentrations was monitored by laboratory experiments. Hardened cement paste consisting of ordinary Portland cement (CEM I) were exposed to aqueous solutions of sodium sulphate for 18 months. Three sample compositions were used for this research, including different supplementary cementitious materials (SCM). The phase composition was determined for different time spans by high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Cross sections of exposed cement prisms were investigated as a representation of the microstructural profile. Based on the data, a temporal and spatial determination of the stages of the sulphate attack and the deterioration course was possible. Cement matrices blended with slag showed the highest resistance against sulphate attack. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.",2015
Recycling of E-plastic waste as a construction material in developing countries,Fresh concrete; Compressive strength; Aggregate; Waste management; Electronic waste,POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE BOTTLES; CEMENT MORTAR; CONCRETE; AGGREGATE,"This paper presents an experimental investigation on structural concrete with partial replacement of coarse aggregate using electronic plastic waste (E-plastic). In view of utilizing the non-degradable waste in the construction industry, the E-plastic from computer plastics was considered as coarse aggregate. Coarse aggregate was replaced with different percentages (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 %) of E-plastic by volume. Tests were performed for properties of fresh and hardened concrete at different ages such as 7 and 28 days. From the investigation, it was noted that the workability of the mix was reduced against the increase in percentage of E-plastic. The compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength of partially replaced concrete was comparatively less than that of the control concrete. The effect of adding the E-plastic in concrete reduced the dry density of the concrete and showed the high deformability behavior before failure. The lesser dry density may be having advantage in self-weight reduction in structural elements which leads to lesser attraction of pseudo inertia forces in the seismic prone area.",2015
Life cycle assessment of construction and demolition waste management,Life cycle assessment; Construction and demolition waste; Road construction; Leaching; Landfilling,ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT; MUNICIPAL WASTE; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; BOTTOM ASH; ROAD CONSTRUCTION; LEACHING BEHAVIOR; CEMENT MORTAR; SERVICE LIFE; CONCRETE; CARBONATION,"Life cycle assessment (LCA) modelling of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) management was carried out. The functional unit was management of 1 Mg mineral, source separated C&DW, which is either utilised in road construction as a substitute for natural aggregates, or landfilled. The assessed environmental impacts included both non-toxic and toxic impact categories. The scenarios comprised all stages of the end-of-life management of C&DW, until final disposal of all residues. Leaching of inorganic contaminants was included, as was the production of natural aggregates, which was avoided because of the use of C&DW. Typical uncertainties related to contaminant leaching were addressed. For most impact categories, utilisation of C&DW in road construction was preferable to landfilling; however, for most categories, utilisation resulted in net environmental burdens. Transportation represented the most important contribution for most nontoxic impacts, accounting for 60-95 per cent of these impacts. Capital goods contributed with negligible impacts. Leaching played a critical role for the toxic categories, where landfilling had lower impacts than utilisation because of the lower levels of leachate per ton of C&DW reaching the groundwater over a 100-year perspective. Leaching of oxyanions (As, V and Sb) was critical with respect to leaching. Typical experimental uncertainties in leaching data did not have a pivotal influence on the results; however, accounting for Cr immobilisation in soils as part of the impact assessment was critical for modelling the leaching impacts. Compared with the overall life cycle of building and construction materials, leaching emissions were shown to be potentially significant for toxicity impacts, compared with contributions from production of the same materials, showing that end-of-life impacts and leaching should not be disregarded when assessing environmental impacts from construction products and materials. CO2 uptake in the C&DW corresponding to 15 per cent carbonation could out-balance global warming impacts from transportation; however, carbonation would also likely result in increased toxicity impacts due to higher leaching of oxyanions.

Recycled Concrete Aggregates in Roadways: Laboratory Examination of Self-Cementing Characteristics,Recycled concrete aggregate; Construction and demolition (C&D) materials; Base/subbase course; Self-cementing,PAVEMENT; CONSTRUCTION,"This paper examines the self-cementing phenomenon of the road construction material known as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). Two RCA types were selected as study materials: (1) high-grade RCA (HRCA), a quality RCA manufactured from relatively high-strength concrete structures; and (2) road base RCA (RBRCA), a high-grade RCA blend combined with brick and general clean rubble (road base material). Laboratory tests were performed to obtain the unconfined compressive strength, indirect tension dynamic modulus, and resilient modulus of the test samples to examine their hardening characteristics when subjected to varying curing periods. These tests were performed in conjunction with microstructure analyses from X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques. The HRCA samples, which were prepared and subjected to varying curing conditions, transformed from an initially unbound material into a bound (fully stabilized) material. The results of XRD and SEM analyses clearly demonstrate that secondary hydration occurred. The RBRCA samples were able to maintain their unbound granular properties, with nonsignificant self-cementing, thus supporting the hypothesis that the mixing of nonactive materials such as bricks and clean rubble into RCA will lessen the tendency of RCA toward self-cementing.

Using alkali-activated natural aluminosilicate minerals to produce compressed masonry construction materials,Compressed earth; Geopolymerization; Aluminosilicate minerals; Compressive strength; Water absorption; Microstructure and pore size distribution,RAMMED EARTH CONSTRUCTION; FLY-ASH; SOIL STABILIZATION; PART 1; GEOPOLYMERS; TECHNOLOGY; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; BLOCKS,"This paper documents research that explores the possibility of alkali activating the aluminosilicate minerals reclaimed from recycled quarried soil products to produce compressed masonry construction materials. The objective of the research is to identify and optimize the principal variables affecting geopolymerization of a common quarry by-product containing montmorillonite and alkali feldspars and other minerals. The key variables optimized in the research were: type and concentration of alkali activator, optimum moisture content for compaction and geopolymerization, and curing temperature and duration. Geopolymerization of natural aluminosilicate minerals exhibiting low reactivity typically require supplementary cementitious materials to achieve high strength. In this case, however, the use of supplementary cementitious materials was eliminated by promoting nucleation in the geopolymerization reaction. The addition of 4 wt.% of nanocalcite or 0.25 wt.% of synthetic nanoaluminosilicates significantly improved the 1- and 7-day compressive strengths of test specimens. Finally, the total porosity and pore-size distribution of the microstructure of certain specimens were characterized. The results were correlated with water absorption and drying shrinkage performance. The results demonstrate the feasibility of alkali activating commonly-occurring, natural aluminosilicates in the soils to produce compressed masonry blocks that exhibit reliable mechanical performance without the use of Portland cement or supplemental cementitious materials.

A multiscale model for the numerical simulation of the anchor bolt pull-out test in lightweight aggregate concrete,Multiscale modeling; Quasibrittle fracture; Lightweight aggregate concrete; Pull-out test,COMPOSITE-MATERIALS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE BEHAVIOR; STRENGTH PREDICTION; CRACK-PROPAGATION; TENSILE-STRENGTH; FRACTURE; SIZE; HOMOGENIZATION; MICROCRACKING,"Lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) has been increasingly used as a construction material in civil and building engineering, especially in earthquake hazard zones, due to its higher strength-to-weight ratio and efficient handling with respect to ordinary concrete. The aim of the present work is to perform complete failure analyses in LWAC taking into account the effects of the underlying microstructure on its overall structural behavior. To this end, a concurrent multiscale method is adopted, in conjunction with an innovative crack modeling framework. Continuous crack propagation along a non-prescribed path is modeled in the LEFM setting, taking advantage of a shape optimization method coupling a moving mesh strategy and a gradient-free optimization solver. The crack penetration through a material interface is also taken into account, by means of a novel re-initiation criterion at interface, based on a material characteristic length. Numerical computations have been carried out with reference to the complete failure analysis of a LWAC specimen subjected to the anchor bolt pull-out test; the related results have shown that the peak and post-peak response is strongly affected by volume fraction and Young's modulus of lightweight aggregates. Their validation has been performed by means of comparisons with a fully homogenized model uniquely based on LEFM approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015
Wireless Sensing in Complex Electromagnetic Media: Construction Materials and Structural Monitoring,Wireless passive sensor; displacement sensor; strain sensor; nested split ring resonator (NSRR); concrete; reinforcing bar (rebar); complex medium; structural health monitoring (SHM),REINFORCED-CONCRETE WALLS; STRAIN SENSOR; ANTENNAS; PH; INTERROGATION; DEFORMATION; TEMPERATURE; PRESSURE,"In this paper, wireless sensing in the presence of complex electromagnetic media created by combinations of reinforcing bars and concrete is investigated. The wireless displacement sensing system, primarily designed for use in structural health monitoring (SHM), is composed of a comb-like nested split-ring resonator (NSRR) probe and a transceiver antenna. Although each complex medium scenario is predicted to have a detrimental effect on sensing in principle, it is demonstrated that the proposed sensor geometry is able to operate fairly well in all scenarios except one. In these scenarios that mimic real-life SHM, it is shown that this sensor exhibits a high displacement resolution of 1 mu m, a good sensitivity of 7 MHz/mm in average, and a high dynamic range extending over 20 mm. For the most disruptive scenario of placing concrete immediately behind NSRR, a solution based on employing a separator behind the probe is proposed to overcome the handicaps introduced by the medium. In order to obtain a one-to-one mapping from the measured frequency shift to the displacement, a numerical fit is proposed and used. The effects of several complex medium scenarios on this fit are discussed. These results indicate that the proposed sensing scheme works well in real-life SHM applications.",2015
Use of modified oil fly ash to enhance asphalt concrete performance,Oil fly ash; Asphalt concrete; Fatigue; Rutting; Resilient modulus,RHEOLOGY,"Combustion of heavy fuel oil at power generation facilities and desalination plants produce large quantities of heavy oil fly ash (OFA). Waste ash production is expected to increase with the increasing use of heavy or cracked oil as fuel in inefficient power generation facilities. Oil ash can pose a health hazard by affecting the respiratory system and may contaminate the water table if improperly dumped. Utilization of the heavy oil ash in construction materials provides a viable use for this by-product, thereby protecting the environment and eliminating the need for building special disposal areas for the ash. In this study, three different chemical treatment methods were used for the surface modification of oil fly ash. Elemental analysis indicated that the treatment process removes some of the elements such as vanadium, iron, and nickel from the OFA samples. FTIR analysis shows that the main difference between the three treatment methods is the introduction of three different functional groups. Untreated and surface-modified oil fly ash were blended with asphalt binder at a ratio of 2 % and used in asphalt concrete mixes. Performance grade of ash modified asphalt binders increased from 64-16 to 76-16. Asphalt concrete mixes modified with chemically treated OFA has 11 % higher split tensile strength, 25 % higher resilient modulus, 1,400 % increase in fatigue life and 55 % reduction in rutting as compared to neat asphalt concrete mix treated with the same asphalt content. Modifying asphalt binder with 2 % of chemically treated OFA significantly improves the performance of the asphalt pavement.",2015

This paper presents experimental investigation results of the chemical resistance of special layer composites and corrosion rate for St3S reinforcement bars that have been covered with special polymer coating applied as the industrial waste material and have been exposed to tensile stresses in a solution simulating pore-liquid of concrete. Potentiostatic investigation and chemical resistance has been carried out in order to determine parameters describing corrosion rate of samples tested. A small decrease of corrosion rate has been found for the steel that has not been covered with polymer coating applied as the industrial waste material when placed in model pore-liquid of concrete and exposed to tensile stress increasing. Corrosion rate for the steel has decreased by 3 orders of magnitude when covered with protective coating even though this latest became unseal at load exceeding 2.5 kN (88.5 MPa) and 5.5 kN (194.5 MPa).,2015
Uncertainty characterization of building emergy analysis (BEmA),Building emergy analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Emergy synthesis; Monte Carlo simulation; Fuzzy logic,INDEXES; SYSTEMS,"In this article, the authors quantify uncertainty of the building emergy analysis (BEmA). The emergy accounting considers environmental sources from the most fundamental context: the sun and the geobiosphere. However, due to the variety of large-scale parameters, BEmA suffers from lack of assurance in estimation. Accordingly, a source and quantity of uncertainty need to be clarified for its wide practical use. For this purpose, uncertainty of the major BEmA parameters, i.e., unit emergy values (UEVs) of the primary construction materials, life time of assemblies, and weight of the used materials, have been analyzed through a case study a typical single-family house in Pennsylvania, United States. Data collected from all available literature was sampled to implement two uncertainty analysis methods: Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and Fuzzy logic. The experiments were conducted with the following two ways: (1) we assumed that that empirical distributions of all the parameters fit into the normal distribution. The propagation of uncertainty was tested by MCS with hyper-cube sampling. (2) Fuzzy logic was employed to estimate distributions of actural values, because, in the reality, replacement intervals of building components and operational energy use tend to be subject to the building occupants' contingent decisions or subjective judgments. In this case, data cannot be described by a steady-state normal distribution. The experimental findings showed that Monte Carlo simulation gave the mean of 9.57 x 10(13) sej/m(2)yr with the standard deviation of 3.73 x 10(13) sej/m(2)yr. Meanwhile, Monte Carlo simulation coupled with the Fuzzy logic reduced variability, thereby resulting in the mean of 8.42 x 10(13) sej/m(2)yr and the standard deviation of 0.94 x 10(13) sej/m(2)yr. Above two results were compared to each other through the KS (Kolmogorov Smirnov) fitness test and the baseline of a point-estimate (7.66 x 10(13) sej/m(2)yr). Sensitivity analysis as a post processing examined the ranked contribution level of each parameter. As a result, it became clear that specific emergy values of the large amount inputs such as electricity and concrete block are the most influential variables to BEmA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Global or local construction materials for post-disaster reconstruction? Sustainability assessment of twenty post-disaster shelter designs,Life cycle assessment; Sustainable construction; Transitional shelters; Post-disaster,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT TOOLS; HOUSING CONSTRUCTION; UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS; BUILDING-MATERIALS; ENERGY; METHODOLOGY; TRANSPORT; CONCRETE; IMPACTS,"The number and intensity of natural disasters is growing every year, with 394 major events affecting over 268 million people worldwide in the past decade. The objective of this study was to identify whether it is more appropriate to use local or global materials in post-disaster reconstruction projects. Twenty transitional shelters were identified over 11 different locations worldwide, and their environmental, economic, and mechanical/technical performances were compared. The environmental and economic assessments were based on life cycle cost and life cycle assessment. In the mechanical/technical assessments, the relationships between hazard zones and their performances were assessed for earthquakes, wind loads and floods. Sustainability was assessed using a benchmark system that incorporates the results from these three categories. The results show that shelters with high technical performance can be achieved with low price/low environmental impact per functional unit regardless of the type of material used. Local materials withhold higher potential for low environmental impacts and costs and global materials have higher potential to produce better technical performances. Although local constructive systems can provide the best compromise between environmental impacts and cost, their structural design requires more effort. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of lunar regolith geopolymer binder as a radioactive shielding material for space exploration applications,Moon construction; Geopolymer; Lunar regolith; Radiation protection; Concrete; Inorganic polymer,HIGH-ENERGY RADIATION,"Future manned missions to the moon will require the ability to build structures using the moon's natural resources. The geopolymer binder described in this paper (Lunamer) is a construction material that consists of up to 98% lunar regolith, drastically reducing the amount of material that must be carried from Earth in the event of lunar construction. This material could be used to fabricate structural panels and interlocking blocks that have radiation shielding and thermal insulation characteristics. These panels and blocks could be used to construct living quarters and storage facilities on the lunar surface, or as shielding panels to be installed on crafts launched from the moon surface to deep-space destinations. Lunamer specimens were manufactured in the laboratory and compressive strength results of up to 16 MPa when cast with conventional methods and 37 MPa when cast using uniaxial pressing were obtained. Simulation results have shown that the mechanical and chemical properties of Lunamer allow for adequate radiation shielding for a crew inside the lunar living quarters without additional requirements.

The present study investigates the feasibility of using the densified mixture design algorithm (DMDA) method to incorporate unground rice husk ash (URHA) as a partial fine aggregate replacement (0-40%) in the production of eco-friendly construction bricks. Fly ash (FA) and residual rice husk ash (RHA) are the main binder materials considered in this study. Solid bricks of 220 x 105 x 60 mm in size were prepared in accordance with official Vietnamese product standards in steel molds under 35 MPa forming pressure. After casting, the brick samples were stored at 35 degrees C and a relative hunlidity of 50% until the ages required for testing. The brick samples were checked for dimensions and visible defects. The effects of URHA content on the engineering properties of the solid bricks, including compressive strength, flexural strength, water absorption, bulk density, and void volume, were also investigated. The test results showed that all brick samples exhibited good physical and mechanical properties. Compressive strength and flexural strength ranged, respectively, between 20.9-31.5 MPa and 5.7-6.7 MPa. All of these values were significantly better than the values required by the official Vietnamese standards. The results of this study demonstrate a significant potential for applying URHA in the production of eco-friendly construction bricks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015

Characterisation of recycled concrete aggregates when used in asphalt concrete: a technical literature review,recycled concrete aggregates; asphalt concrete; physical properties; porous attached mortar; mechanical properties,HOT-MIX ASPHALT; DEMOLITION WASTE; BUILDING-MATERIALS; CONSTRUCTION; DEBRIS; MIXTURE; HMA,"Concrete is one of the most widely used construction and building materials. When a concrete structure reaches the end of its life, the demolition waste may be used to produce recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). RCA mainly differ from natural aggregates in the attached mortar that remains onto the RCA surface. The differences between the properties of RCA and those of natural aggregates will condition the performance of the construction materials that contain RCA. Specifically, asphalt concrete (AC) that contains RCA has many technical disadvantages due to the porous nature of the attached mortar and thus, the high water and bitumen absorption and the low resistance to fragmentation of the RCA. However, some authors have experimented with the application of treatments to the RCA that allow its successful use in the manufacture of AC, which contributes to sustainable development. This paper reviews the main properties of the RCA, particularly when used to produce AC.",2015
Strength evaluation of concrete with fly ash and GGBFS as cement replacing materials,concrete; strength; pozzolanic materials; fly ash; ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS),BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; HYDRATION,"Concrete is the most widely used material of construction. Concrete gained the popularity as a construction material due to the easy availability of its component materials, the easy formability, strength and rigidity upon setting and curing. In construction industry, strength is the primary criterion in selecting a concrete for a particular application. Now a days, the substantial amount of waste materials, containing the properties of the Pozzolana, is being generated from the major industries; and disposal of such industrial wastes generated in abundance is also a serious problem from the environmental and pollution point of view. On this backdrop, efforts are made by the researchers for exploring the possible utilization of such waste materials in making the sustainable construction material. The present paper reports the experimental investigations to study the strength characterization of concrete made from the pozzolanic waste materials. For this purpose, the Pozzolanic materials such as fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag were used as a cement replacing materials in conjunction with ordinary Portland cement. Equal amount of these materials were used in eight trial mixes with varying amount of cement. The water cement ratio was also varied. The chemical admixture was also added to improve the workability of concrete. The compressive strengths for 7, 28, 40 and 90 days' were evaluated whereas the flexural and tensile strengths corresponding to 7, 28 and 40 days were evaluated. The study corroborates that the pozzolanic materials used in the present investigation along with the cement can render the sustainable concrete.",2015
Potential of cement-treated sugar cane bagasse ash (SCBA) as highway construction material,,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; FLY-ASH; REPLACEMENT; MORTARS; WASTE,"Sugar cane is a particularly useful product in developing countries and its production rate is impressive in countries including Cuba, Brazil, India, Thailand, Pakistan, Colombia, Mexico and The Philippines. Unfortunately, as is the case with almost every useful material, it leaves behind its waste as ash, which is largely dumped in landfills. These landfills destroy the appearance of the landscape as well as rapidly becoming an environmental burden. Use of bagasse ash in soils and in concrete has been successfully proven, but its possible potential as a highway construction material remains to be demonstrated. This paper aims to explore it as a useful material for highway construction. To test its potential as a subgrade material, compaction tests, and unconfined compressive strength and California bearing ratio (CBR) tests were conducted for evaluation. Sugarcane bagasse ash (SCBA) was mixed with cement content in proportions of 3%, 6% and 9% and then properly cured. The results were strikingly positive. The highest maximum dry density obtained was 727.8 kg/m(3) for the 9% cement SCBA mix, with a compressive strength value of 6.46 tonnes/m(2). Highest CBR values were 7.3% for the 4-day cured sample and 23% for 40-day cured sample. Recycling of SCBA waste in productive construction activities will yield profoundly positive results in terms of environmental protection, waste management practices, and saving of raw materials.",2015
Performance of soft-hard-soft (SHS) cement based composite subjected to blast loading with consideration of interface properties,high strength concrete (SHS); engineered cementitious composite; interface; blast test; strain rate effect,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; PROJECTILE IMPACT; MODEL,"This paper presents a combined experimental and numerical study on the damage and performance of a soft-hard-soft (SHS) multi-layer cement based composite subjected to blast loading which can be used for protective structures and infrastructures to resist extreme loadings, and the composite consists of three layers of construction materials including asphalt concrete (AC) on the top, high strength concrete (HSC) in the middle, and engineered cementitious composites (ECC) at the bottom. To better characterize the material properties under dynamic loading, interface properties of the composite were investigated through direct shear test and also used to validate the interface model. Strain rate effects of the asphalt concrete were also studied and both compressive and tensile dynamic increase factor (DIF) curves were improved based on split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) test. A full-scale field blast test investigated the blast behavior of the composite materials. The numerical model was established by taking into account the strain rate effect of all concrete materials. Furthermore, the interface properties were also considered into the model. The numerical simulation using nonlinear finite element software LS-DYNA agrees closely with the experimental data. Both the numerical and field blast test indicated that the SHS composite exhibited high resistance against blast loading.",2015
EFFECT OF THE AGGREGATE TYPE ON THE PROPERTIES OF ALKALI-ACTIVATED SLAG SUBJECTED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES,alkali-activated slag; high temperatures; chamotte; quartz; strength; microstructure,ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; CONCRETE; PASTE; BEHAVIOR; FIRE,"High temperatures present a risk of destruction for most silicate-based construction materials. Although these materials are not flammable, they lose their properties due to a thermal decomposition. In contrast to ordinary Portland-cement-based materials, alkali-activated slag exhibits a better thermal stability when exposed to temperatures up to 1200 degrees C. Due to its different porosity it is less susceptible to spalling. However, the properties of the composites after a high-temperature treatment depend also on the stability of the aggregates. The effects of two different types of the aggregate (quartz and chamotte) on the residual mechanical properties and microstructure of the alkali-activated slag mortars exposed to 200-1200 degrees C is presented in this study. The results showed an improved mechanical performance of the thermally stable chamotte aggregate at temperatures above 600 degrees C. alpha-quartz is transformed to beta-quartz at 573 degrees C, causing a volume instability and, consequently, a strength deterioration. Although chamotte also contains some quartz phase, the reaction of mullite with the alkalis from the matrix leads to the formation of albite and anorthite, making the material tougher and, thus, compensating the negative effect of quartz.",2015
Material Performance and Animal Clinical Studies on Performance-Optimized Hwangtoh Mixed Mortar and Concrete to Evaluate Their Mechanical Properties and Health Benefits,Hwangtoh; health benefits; Institute for Cancer Research (ICR); material properties; mix proportion design,BINDER; CEMENT,"In this study, the amount of cement used in a concrete mix is minimized to reduce the toxic effects on users by adjusting the concrete mixture contents. The reduction of cement is achieved by using various admixtures (ground granulated blast-furnace slag, flyash, ordinary Portland cement, and activated Hwangtoh powder). To apply the mix to construction, material property tests such as compressive strength, slump, and pH are performed. Preliminary experimental results showed that the Hwangtoh concrete could be used as a healthy construction material. Also, the health issues and effects of Hwangtoh mortar are quantitatively evaluated through an animal clinical test. Mice are placed in Hwangtoh mortar and cement mortar cages to record their activity. For the test, five cages are made with Hwangtoh and ordinary Portland cement mortar floors, using Hwangtoh powder replacement ratios of 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the normal cement mortar mixing ratio, and two cages are made with Hwangtoh mortar living quarters. The activity parameter measurements included weight, food intake, water intake, residential space selection, breeding activity, and aggression. The study results can be used to evaluate the benefits of using Hwangtoh as a cement replacing admixture for lifestyle, health and sustainability.",2015
Mechanical Properties of Southern Pine Cross-Laminated Timber,Cross-laminated timber (CLT); Mechanical property; Resistance to shear by compression loading; Rolling shear; Southern pine; Resistance to delamination,,"Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a novel wood building material suitable for floor, roof, and wall assemblies in low-and mid-rise construction as an alternative to concrete and steel. CLTs are considered to provide good seismic resistance, fast erection times, carbon sequestration, and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over other construction materials. Southern pine is an abundant forest resource; yet it has not been commercially used for CLT manufacturing. The purpose of this paper was to measure the bending and shear properties of CLT material fabricated using southern pine lumber compared to product standards. Bending strength, bending stiffness, shear strength, resistance to shear by compression loading strength, and resistance to delamination were measured according to product standards, and test results were compared with values given in the standards. Bending tests were conducted on jointed beams due to test length requirements. Bending strength, bending stiffness, and wood failure in resistance to shear by compression loading tests exceeded the published values for the published values, while resistance to delamination did not meet the established criteria. The resistance to delamination results may have been affected by the uncontrolled moisture content of the lumber during fabrication of the CLTs. The application of glued laminated lumber standards to CLT products requires clarification in the orientation of loading directions for the resistance to shear by a compression loading test and the measurement of all four sides of the resistance to delamination specimens. Increased scrutiny of moisture content quality control is highly encouraged for the production of CLTs. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2015
Mechanical Properties and Behavior of Traditional Adobe Wall Panels of the Aveiro District,,STRESS-STRAIN CHARACTERISTICS; MASONRY; COMPRESSION; CONCRETE; BRICKS,"In the Aveiro district, Portugal, adobe was a construction material extensively used until the middle of the twentieth century. Presently, many adobe constructions are still in use, presenting important cultural, social, and architectural value. Many of these constructions, however, are in a poor state of conservation, displaying severe structural anomalies. This negligence is in part due to a lack of knowledge concerning the mechanical behavior and properties of adobe masonry. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to this knowledge. Ten full-scale adobe wall panels were constructed in the laboratory with adobes collected from an existing construction and with mortar formulated with the composition traditionally used. Five wall panels were tested in simple compression and five wall panels in diagonal compression. From these tests it was possible to determine and evaluate the stress-strain relationships, strength, deformation, stiffness, and damage pattern of the adobe masonry walls. This knowledge can support the adequate rehabilitation and retrofitting of existing buildings, the calibration of numerical models, and even the design of new adobe constructions.

"Geotechnical approach to evaluate natural fine aggregates concrete strength, Sohag, Governorate, Upper Egypt",Fluvial fine aggregates; Qena Formation; Grading; Chemical stability; Workability; Concrete strength,SHAPE,"Aggregates are used in a variety of construction applications, and each application has its particular requirements as to the aggregate's properties. Aggregates for concrete production occupy 70-80 % of its volume, where fine aggregates represent about 1/3 of the total volume of aggregates. Fluvial aggregate constitutes one of the most naturally occurring resources of building materials. In Sohag Governorate, Upper Egypt, natural fluvial fine aggregates of Qena Formation are distributed with a wide range of potential sources. Geological and engineering characteristics of these aggregates are of vital importance in the evaluation of these aggregates, especially when they are used as a construction material. The estimated reserve of fine aggregates covers more than 833 million m(3). Fineness modulus value of these aggregates varies from 2.2 to 2.9 and their roundness degree indicates small amounts of inter-particle void content and tight pack. The fine aggregates of Qena Formation are composed mainly of quartz (95 %), feldspars (4 %), and trace amount of calcite (similar to 1 %). The chemical analyses proved that theses aggregates can be used to produce concrete without chemical destructive attack. Based on the mineralogical composition and chemical stability data of the studied fluvial fine aggregates of Qena Formation, these aggregates are stable enough (compositionally and chemically) and are capable of producing concrete without sulfate and other alkalis attack.",2015
Thermite reactions with oxides of iron and silicon during combustion of magnesium with lunar and Martian regolith simulants,Heterogeneous combustion; Thermites; Combustion synthesis; Magnesium; Iron oxide; Silica,PHYSICAL ASSETS; CARBON-DIOXIDE; MARS MISSIONS; FABRICATION; PARTICLES; MIXTURES; PROPAGATION; CONCRETE,"It has been shown recently that mixtures of JSC-1A lunar regolith simulant with magnesium are combustible. Thermite-type reactions in these mixtures could be used for in situ production of construction materials on the Moon. Because of complex composition of lunar regolith, however, the mechanisms of these reactions are not well understood. Also, for Mars mission applications, it is important to explore the possibility of using Martian regolith in such mixtures. In the present paper, combustion of two Martian regolith simulants (JSC-Mars-1A and Mojave Mars) with magnesium is studied using thermodynamic calculations and combustion experiments. To understand the reaction mechanisms in these mixtures as well as in the mixtures of JSC-1A lunar regolith simulant with magnesium, thermoanalytical experiments are also conducted. It has been shown that the Martian regolith simulants form combustible mixtures with magnesium. The measured combustion temperatures and identified product compositions are in reasonable agreement with thermodynamic predictions. The mixtures of JSC-Mars-1A with magnesium at 2030 wt% Mg exhibit higher temperatures and burn more vigorously than mixtures based on Mojave Mars, which is explained by the higher content of iron oxide in JSC-Mars-1A. For Mojave Mars, combustion is accompanied by oscillations in the front motion and by the formation of a layered structure of the product. This effect is more significant at lower concentrations of Mg. Thermoanalytical studies have shown that iron oxide plays a dominant role in the combustion of JSC-Mars-1A simulant with magnesium. However, Mg/SiO2 mixture ignites at a temperature lower by approximately 100 degrees C than for Mg/Fe2O3. For Mojave Mars material and JSC-1A lunar regolith simulant, which include more silica and less iron oxide, silica exhibits a significant effect on the combustion, promoting reactions at lower temperatures.

Laboratory tests reveal specific gravity (2.65-3.02), water absorption (0.32-0.38 %), Aggregate Impact and Aggregate Crushing values (17.26-27.01 % and 15.59-21.21 %), Flakiness and Elongation Index (6.01-7.80 % and 5.95-9.39 %), sulphate soundness (2.19-4.07 %) and Los Angeles abrasion value (28.13-35.70 %) of these rocks. Values of these parameters were compared with the ASTM and BS standards which indicate that Mansehra Granite, Hakale Granite, quartzite and dolerite can be the potential source for dimension stone, road and concrete aggregate. Stripping test indicates suitability of these rocks as aggregate for asphalt wearing course. Unconfined compressive strength of gneissic and massive Mansehra Granites varies from 61.50 to 66.20 MPa. Owing to lower unconfined compressive strength, higher flakiness and elongation index, aggregate impact and crushing values, the gneissic Mansehra Granite is not recommended as dimension stones, road and cement concrete. Petrographic studies indicate presence of strained quartz in Mansehra Granite, Hakale Granite and quartzite which suggest that these rocks are prone to alkali-silica reactivity potential and may not be used as cement concrete aggregate.",2015

However, concrete can easily be cracked and has a limited lifespan. Among strategies for healing cracks and recycling concrete, microbial carbonate precipitation (MCP) by nitrogen-involved heterotrophic bacteria showed great potential. In this study, an alternative technology using autophototrophs is proposed to overcome the pollution generated by urea-based MCP. We studied biomineralization of cyanobacteria Synechococcus PCC8806 in the cement solution, and investigated the impact of this process on concrete properties. Solution composition and cell viability were monitored and the morphology of precipitates was observed with scanning and transmission electron microscopy as well as atomic force microscopy. Chemical components were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Results show that Synechococcus PCC8806 were intact in the cement solution, and the biotic-formed precipitates were different in morphology and nearly doubled in amount compared with abiotic-formed ones. The experiments on concrete cubes revealed that a thick calcite-cell aggregate layer adhering to the concrete was formed biotically, while several thin carbonate patches were distributed on the concrete abiotically. This calcite-cell layer decreased the water absorption, and was resistant to sonication. Consequently, Synechococcus PCC8806 show a great potential for restoring concrete. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

SBA was characterized using particle size distribution, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). SEM monographs show the rough surface with plenty of fine pores. XRF, XRD, and physicochemical properties of the SBA prove its suitability as a pozzolanic or cementitious material. TGA confirms thermal stability till 650 degrees C. On the suitability of principal raw material, SBA-quarry dust (QD)-lime (L) bricks were developed with a constant composition of lime (20% by weight) and tested for physicomechanical (weight, dry density, water absorption, efflorescence, and compressive strength), functional (thermal conductivity, k), durability (chloride, sulfate, and carbonation), and environmental [toxicity characteristics leaching protocol (TCLP)] properties as per recommendations. The developed (SBA-QD-L) bricks were further analyzed for technical feasibility with commercially available and accepted masonry products like clay and fly ash bricks.

Permeable pavements are increasingly being used as urban stormwater management systems. Three commonly found recycled C&D waste materials, crushed brick (CB), recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), were investigated to assess their suitability as permeable pavement subbase materials. Geotextile was also used in this research to trap pollutants. The laboratory tests included basic physical characterization such as particle size distribution, specific gravity, water absorption, Los Angeles abrasion, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), and modified Proctor compaction tests. In addition, hydraulic conductivity tests were undertaken in a laboratory test setup with different influent suspension percentages and moisture contents. Temporal variations of effluent suspension percentages were investigated to assess clogging effects. It was found that the geotextile layer did not have any effect in terms of permeability of the C&D materials. The chemical assessment included organic content, pH value, trace element, and leachate concentration for a range of contaminant constituents and compared with maximum allowable limits in soil and natural water as well as with the environmental protection authorities' requirements. In terms of geotechnical and chemical assessment for permeable pavement applications, RCA was found to be a suitable alternative construction material for permeable pavements, while CB was borderline and RAP did not meet some of the specified requirements.

The products of construction biotechnologies are low cost, sustainable, and environmentally friendly microbial biocements and biogrouts for the construction ground improvement. The microbial polysaccharides are used as admixtures for cement. Microbially produced biodegradable bioplastics can be used for the temporarily constructions. The bioagents that are used in construction biotechnologies are either pure or enrichment cultures of microorganisms or activated indigenous microorganisms of soil. The applications of microorganisms in the construction processes are bioaggregation, biocementation, bioclogging, and biodesaturation of soil. The biotechnologically produced construction materials and the microbially-mediated construction technologies have a lot of advantages in comparison with the conventional construction materials and processes.

Resource Targets in Europe and Worldwide: An Overview,resource management; resource policy; resource efficiency; material efficiency,,"For 20 years, the number of resource policy approaches with direct and indirect relations to raw materials, resource and material efficiency has grown enormously at national and international level. This discussion paper makes an inventory of different political and regulatory approaches that contain a direct or indirect reference to resources such as construction materials, industrial minerals, or metals. They are examined and evaluated regarding foci and resource priorities as well as further categories such as target lines, governance levels, indicators used, integration into wider target systems, specification, and implementation. The aim is to provide an overview of the spectrum of resource objectives in international, European, and national strategies, programs, and initiatives. The closer analysis of raw material targets embedded in the policy programs and legal approaches reveals that most goals lack a time frame and a concrete vision, thus remain at a strategic level. To complement the overview, the state of research in the field of modeling and simulation is briefly discussed. Concluding remarks concerning their relation to the objectives identified and the task of target setting complete the discussion.",2015

The concentrations of 22 metals in the ambient air were calculated on the basis of the ICP-MS experimental determination of their contents in the insoluble fraction of snow cover. Non-carcinogenic hazards were estimated for the areas of power plant (""Zone PP""), brickworks location (""Zone BF""), zone influenced by concrete product plants (""Zone CP""), and petrochemical plant suburbs (""Zone PCP""). Manganese, Al, Cu, and Ba make the largest contribution to the integral non-cancer hazard caused by chronic inhalation intake in all areas. Zinc is added to the above listed elements in the ""Zone PP"" and V, Co, Cr, and Ni in the ""Zone BF"" are also added. Densely populated residential areas ""Zone BF"" and ""Zone PP"" were characterized by the higher levels of diseases risks associated with human inhalation intake of metals in comparison with other areas. The dust load should be primarily decreased in the zones subjected to harmful effects of brick factories and other construction materials.

Study on feasibility of reutilizing textile effluent sludge for producing concrete blocks,Textile effluent sludge; Lime-based pretreatment; Concrete block; Ammonia; Leaching,CEMENT,"With an increasing interest in recycling and reusing waste, there is a need to carry out research on exploring ways to transform industrial wastes into construction materials. This paper attempts to explore the feasibility of reutilizing textile effluent sludge (TES) for producing concrete blocks with a pretreatment step. The lime-based pretreatment process was adopted to remove ammonia in TES which had been found to lead to bad odor and strength loss of the concrete blocks. The concrete blocks were prepared with an aggregate to cement ratio of 12, 10 and 6. The pretreated TES was adopted to replace the fine aggregate at a mass ratio ranging from 0% to 30%. The compressive strength and drying shrinkage values were determined to evaluate the performance of concrete blocks containing TES. The results indicated that the lime-based pretreatment process can lower the ammonia concentration in TES significantly. The concrete blocks with a lower TES content and lower ammonia concentration had higher compressive strength and better volume stability. When the TES content in the concrete blocks was about 10%, the concrete blocks with an aggregate to cement ratio of 10 can satisfy the minimum strength requirement for non-load bearing applications. Meanwhile, the result of leaching test indicated that the toxic trace metals present in textile effluent sludge could be stabilized/solidified and metal leaching from the concrete blocks is not a concern.

This study examines the long-term aging reactions of EAFS and its volumetric stability, to gain further knowledge of this by-product, its behaviour as a construction material, and its inherent risk of swelling. Additionally, the good compressive strength of hydraulic mixes that incorporate this slag can be analyzed and explained on the basis of its steady and expansive compounds and its chemical evolution over time in the interfacial transition zone (ITZ); the appearance of calcium carbonate enhances the cohesiveness, stiffness and strength of this zone and, as a consequence, of the hydraulic concrete.

Large scale phononic metamaterials for seismic isolation,,BAND-STRUCTURE,"In this work, we numerically examine structures that could be characterized as large scale phononic metamaterials. These novel structures could have band gaps in the frequency spectrum of seismic waves when their dimensions are chosen appropriately, thus raising the belief that they could be serious candidates for seismic isolation structures. Different and easy to fabricate structures were examined made from construction materials such as concrete and steel.

"Zeolite, Study of Aptitude as a Natural Pozzolan Applied to Structural Concrete",Zeolite; Concrete; Pozzolan; Mineral Admixture; Replacement,PORTLAND-CEMENT; HYDRATION,"Nowadays, concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials due to its low price, appropriate mechanic characteristics and durability. Also, due to its ease to adopt diverse forms and sizes (Najimi et al., 2012). Owing to the importance in the use of concrete as a structural material and to its impact in the environment as a consumer of great quantities of natural resources and emitter of CO2 in the concrete industry, it is necessary to develop, from the science of materials, mixtures that support the growth of the construction industry and that consider the environment. Therefore, it becomes necessary to develop energetically efficient materials. A natural zeolite was studied as a material with potential pozzolanic activity and as partial replacement in different percentages of Portland cement in structural concrete. The results of the mechanic trials in concrete samples prove the feasibility of using this element as pozzolanic material.",2015

Used tires are of category of waste whose recycling is extensively difficult because of highly complex structure, the diverse composition of the raw material. Concrete is a versatile construction material due to easy fabrication, locally available material, and high mechanical strength. The use of waste tires as a concrete additive is a possible disposal solution. Rubberized concrete may thus contribute in sustainable construction by use of industrial waste, minimizing the natural resources and producing a more efficient material. In this paper experimental investigation is carried out to evaluate the flexural strength, compressive strength, abrasion resistance and carbonation of concrete containing waste rubber tire fibers as partial replacement of fine aggregates. Fibers from mechanical grinding of used rubber tire have been incorporated with three water-binder ratio and six levels of rubber fibers contents (0-25%). It has also been shown that with increasing replacement level of rubber fibers, flexural strength and abrasion resistance is increased. Further, it has been also observed that compressive strength (up to 90 days) and carbonation depth change with the increasing of the replacement level of waste rubber content.

Indoor radon measurements were made using LR-115 type II cellulose nitrate films and the concentrations were estimated by knowing the track density of films through optical microscope. Soil gas radon levels were measured using RAD7, an electronic radon detector manufactured by Durridge Company, USA. This study sheds light on the seasonal indoor radon activities in Rajasthan dwellings. Maximum values of the indoor radon concentration were observed during the winter and minimum during the summer season. Results show that ventilation rate is inversely proportional to radon level. Highest level of indoor radon concentration was found in the mud type dwellings compared with dwellings made of concrete, cement and marble. A positive correlation (R-2 = 0.45) between indoor radon and soil gas radon concentration was observed. A weak positive correlation (R-2 = 0.22) was observed between soil gas radon concentration and radium content in soil. Indoor radon concentration was found to be associated with the presence of radon concentration in local soil, building material used for roof, floor and walls, type of ventilation conditions and presence of cracks on the walls/floor. Positive correlation between indoor and soil gas radon concentration suggest the large contribution of local soil towards indoor radon.",2015
Comparative life cycle assessment of concrete road pavements using industrial by-products as alternative materials,Life cycle assessment; Concrete road pavements; Alternative construction materials,ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; HIGH-VOLUME; ASPHALT; SLAG; ASH,"The construction industry is a major consumer of natural resources and a major contributor to CO2 emissions. As increasing attention is paid to sustainability and resource preservation, current construction practices need to be assessed in terms of environmental performance as well. Currently, the decision making process for pavement construction in Greece is largely based on initial cost, excluding use and maintenance costs as well as environmental performance. Therefore, the use of concrete road pavements is very limited, despite possible technical and financial benefits. In the present paper, a comparative life cycle assessment was carried out for six different concrete road pavements. The parameters for the comparative LCA were three types of binders; a pozzolanic Portland cement, a new hydraulic road binder and a mixed-type binder consisting of Portland cement and fly ash, as well as two different aggregates; crushed limestone and steel slag. Construction, use and maintenance and end-of-life recycling for a period of 40 years were considered for the life cycle assessment. Results show that concrete road pavements with high volume of alternative materials can reduce CO2-eq emissions to a great extent compared to ordinary concrete pavements and, thus, significantly improve their environmental footprint. The transportation distance sensitivity analysis showed that substituting cement with fly ash is environmentally beneficial even when fly ash is transported over long distances, while the emissions from the use of alternative aggregates in concrete are reduced only in limited geographical areas.

A Business approach for transformation to sustainable construction: an implementation on a developing country,Developing countries; Sustainable transformation; Market barriers; Business approach; Kotter's model,AWARENESS,"Construction industry in several developing countries has undergone major transitions to cope with their national economic goals and - as importantly - to align their markets with the growing global sustainability trends. This study proposes a business approach addressing the common barriers against the strong presence of sustainable construction materials in these countries. The Egyptian market was selected as a candidate for a potential sustainable transformation. The use of sustainable concrete is advocated as a pivotal market transformation that warrants technical leverage in the construction industry and ensures local development as well as global competitiveness. A mixed-mode survey was performed to estimate the level of understanding of sustainable construction and, thus, gauge market's receptiveness to change. Like most sustainable changes in developing countries, the use of sustainable concrete in Egypt as a mainstream construction material is challenged by the stagnant culture of the industry and the absence of a proactive legislative role. Business implementation of the desired transformation is suggested to endure the three stages of the Kotter's model for change: unfreeze-change-lock. In view of the noted commonness of the barriers and similarities in construction cultures of developing countries, due consideration to the proposed approach could be given in these markets. The business dimension of this effort is intended to complement past attempts promoting sustainable transformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015

The target substances were 16 PAHs from the EPA priority pollutant list. OSA samples and OSA-based mortars were tested for leaching, according to European standard EN 12457-2 (2002). European standard CEN/TC 15862(2012) for monolithic matter was used for OSA-based concrete. Water extracts were analysed by GC-MS for the concentration of PAHs. Naphthalene, acenaphthene, fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene and pyrene were detected. Still, the release of PAHs was below the threshold limit value for inert waste. The amount of the finest fraction (particle size < 0.045 mm), the content of the Al-Si glass phase and the surface characteristics were the main factors, which could affect the accessibility of PAHs for leaching. The mobility of PAHs from OSA of CFB and PF boilers was 20.2 and 9.9 %, respectively. Hardening of OSA-based materials did not lead to the immobilisation of soluble PAHs. Release of PAHs from the monolith samples did not exceed 0.5 mu g/m(2). In terms of leaching of PAHs, OSA is safe to be used for construction purposes.",2015

In this paper, the effect of different parameters such as volume fraction, LWA grading and sand to cement ratio on compressive strength, and elastic modulus of lightweight concrete have been studied. In this study, 36 different mix designs were developed; 3 different sand to cement ratios, 4 volume fractions and 3 different gradings of LWA were considered in order to study the effect of these parameters and find out an efficient mix design for structural use. In order to investigate the effect of each parameter on the compressive strength and elastic modulus, a multivariate analysis of variation was performed. Results indicate that the volume fraction and the LWA grading are the two key parameters influencing compressive strength comparing with sand to cement ratios. Moreover, it was concluded that the sand to cement (S/C) ratio could be as effective as other parameters on elastic modulus of LWAC.",2015
Repair of Concrete Bridge Deck Expansion Joints Using Elastomeric Concrete,Concrete bridges; Bridge decks; Bridge maintenance; Polymer; Construction materials; Rehabilitation,,"The deterioration and failure of bridge deck expansion joints is an ever-growing concern among bridge researchers and designers alike. Deterioration of bridge deck expansion joints can lead to the decay of the structure beneath it, and dangerous debris can materialize in the roadway. Although repair methods vary throughout the United States, guidelines for the repair of bridge deck expansion joints do not currently exist. The purpose of this study was to provide preliminary data for the behavior of bridge deck expansion joints repaired with elastomeric concrete. The experimental study included 30 test specimens simulating the failure and repair of existing bridge deck expansion joints. The blockouts used various configurations filled with elastomeric concrete to determine the capacity of the repairs under a combination of simulated wheel and braking loads. The results showed the capacity of the repair to be more dependent on the depth of the blockouts rather than the longitudinal dimension in the direction of the roadway, while further investigation also showed a correlation with the aspect ratio of the blockouts.

The fact that construction materials contribute in a most decisive way to sustainable building management has been proven by many studies; they are therefore rightly important elements for the energy conscious and bioclimatic design and construction of new buildings. Their exact and environmental features, however, have to be determined on a product specific base, as they depend on the raw material used, the manufacturing process applied and the energy sources used for the production. Furthermore, the determination of the materials' environmental impact can be carried out in many methodological ways. This paper presents the environmental impacts deriving from the environmental evaluation analysis of the most widely used construction materials, on the base of two environmental assessment methodologies: the Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and the Carbon Footprint Analysis, also discussing their link with ecolabelling. The results drawn, verify the potential of those methodologies as effective tools towards sustainable constructions as well the role that efficient energy and raw materials use has in reducing the environmental impact of building materials' production.

In construction materials, especially in cement and concrete, the use of nano/microparticles and fibers has opened new ways from improved mechanical properties to enhanced functionalities. Generally, the production or manufacturing processes of nano/micro-sized particles are energy intensive and expensive. Therefore, it is very important to explore new methods and procedures to synthesize less energy intensive, cost effective and eco-friendly inert nano/micro-sized particles for the utilization in the cement composites. The research presented here describes the procedures for the production of inert, micro-sized, carbonized particles from bamboo. Four types of inert carbonized particles were produced from bamboo by using different procedures. Furthermore, the developed inert carbonized particles were utilized in the preparation of cement composites and effects of their inclusion on the performance of cement composites were studied. Three wt% additions i.e. 0.05, 0.08, 0.20 of cement were investigated for each category of inert particles. The mechanical characterization of specimens suggested that 0.08 wt% addition of inert carbonized bamboo particles enhances the flexural strengths and toughness of cement composites by 66% and 103% respectively.

Use of silicon carbide sludge to form porous alkali-activated materials for insulating application,,TEMPERATURE; GEOPOLYMERS; EMISSIONS; CERAMICS,"One of the objectives in the field of alkali-activated materials is the development of materials having greater thermal performances than conventional construction materials such as aerated concrete. The aim of this paper is to present the possibility to obtain controlled porosity and controlled thermal properties with geopolymer materials including a waste like silicon carbide sludge. The porosity is created by the reaction of free silicon contains in silicon carbide sludge leading to the formation of hydrogen. Two possible ways are investigated to control the porosity: modification of mixture formulation and additives introduction. The first way is the most promising and allowed the formation of materials presenting the same density but various porosities, which shows that the material is adaptable to the application. The insulation properties are logically linked to the porosity and density of materials. A lower value of thermal conductivity of 0.075 W.m(-1).K-1 can be reached for a material with a low density of 0.27 g.cm(-3). These characteristics are really good for a mineral-based material which always displays non-negligible resistance to manipulation.",2015

However, there are many different types of cement products, roughly ranging from traditional products with rather linear resource flows to more synergistic alternatives where industrial byproducts are utilized to a large extent. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies indicate the synergistic products are favorable from an environmental perspective. In co-operation with the global cement producing company CEMEX a research project has been carried out to contribute to a better understanding of the CO2 performance of different ways of producing cement, and different cement products. The focus has been on Cluster West, which is a cement production cluster consisting of three plants in Germany. This paper is the first in a series of three, all of which are included in this special issue. It has two main aims. The first is to carry out an attributional LCA and compare three different cement products produced in both linear and synergistic production setups. This has been done for cradle to gate, focusing on CO2-eq emissions for Cluster West. The second aim of this part is to develop and test a simplified LCA model for this production cluster, with the intention to be able to compare different versions of the production system based on the information of a few parameters. The attributional LCA showed that cement products that contain alarge proportion of byproducts, in this case, ground granulated blast furnace slag, from the iron and steel industry, had the lowest unit emissions of CO2-eq. The difference between the lowest emission product (CEM III/B) and the highest (CEM I) was about 66% per tonne. A simplified LCA model based on six key performance indicators, instead of approximately 50 parameters for the attributional LCA, was established. It showed that Cluster West currently emits about 45% less CO2-eq per tonne of average product compared to 1997. The simplified LCA model can be used effectively to model future changes of both plants and products (which is further discussed in part II and part III). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Shrinkage Characteristics of Alkali-Activated Slag Cements,Alkali-activated slag cements; Autogenous shrinkage; Drying shrinkage; Self-desiccation; Chemical shrinkage,REDUCING ADMIXTURES; DRYING SHRINKAGE; EARLY AGES; MORTARS; HYDRATION; CONCRETE; PASTES,"Recent interest in creating green construction materials has sparked the development of portland cement-free binders. Alkali-activated slag (AAS) concrete has a low embodied energy and comparable or superior strengths to ordinary portland cement (OPC) concrete. However, one factor limiting AAS usage is its durability performance, specifically its susceptibility to shrinkage. Before declaring AAS a marketable product, the mechanisms behind its volumetric instability need to be understood. This paper presents a preliminary study of the shrinkage deformations of various AAS mixtures, wherein four unique AAS mortars were designed and tested for autogenous, chemical, and drying shrinkage; time of setting; and compressive strength. All results were compared to those obtained for a control OPC mortar. Alkali-activated slag mixtures with comparable strength to OPC show a higher autogenous and drying shrinkage. A lower elastic stiffness, higher degree of saturation, and potentially higher chemical shrinkage contribute to the high autogenous shrinkage of AAS. A lower elastic stiffness also leads to a large drying shrinkage, although other mechanisms, such as reduced pore size and carbonation shrinkage, are likely to also contribute to the high drying shrinkage measured for AAS.",2015

This paper's primary objective is to present material properties of portland cement stabilized VHMS and discuss its immediate reuse for disaster recovery. The paper focuses on laboratory properties that can be achieved by combinations of three soils with differing plasticity, seven portland cements at varying dosages, and two very high moisture levels. Approximately 1,200 unconfined compression tests were performed. Laboratory test results indicated shear strengths of 0.1-3.8kg/cm2 could be achieved after 1-7days of room temperature curing. Literature and practice review indicated chemically stabilized VHMS (i.e.,emergency construction material) could be mixed with pugmills or concrete ready-mix trucks, pumped 1-3.2km, and placed without mechanical compaction. Beneficial reuse after disaster recovery ceases is also likely in many applications. The overall assessment of the paper is that portland cement stabilized VHMS can be a viable solution for disaster recovery.",2015
Shrinkage Behavior of Sustainable Concrete with Crushed Returned Concrete Aggregate,Shrinkage; Concrete; Prediction models,,"In the current trend of sustainability, the concrete community has been aggressively looking into adopting green construction material practices and at the same time improving concrete quality and performance for extensive service life and adaptive reuse. Concrete is the construction material most used in the world, with an estimated yearly production of 2.35billion tons worldwide. In the United States, it is estimated that on average approximately 5% of the ready-mix concrete produced is unused and returned to the plant with only a small portion reused. Such a material when further processed, identified as crushed returned concrete aggregate (CCA), has a significant residual value because among other things it is free of contaminants and has better quality than recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The objective of this study was to assess the shrinkage behavior of CCA concrete mixtures produced with aggregate from returned concrete. The aggregate was prepared from concrete of different strength. The virgin aggregate (stone) was replaced either partially or at 100% level in the concrete mixtures. The response of the hyperbolic shrinkage prediction model was examined, and based on the experimental results an alternative model is proposed. The proposed model and methodology can be used to estimate the drying shrinkage of CCA mixtures, and eventually can be adopted for assessing the shrinkage behavior of these concrete mixtures in other regions.",2015
Size independent fracture energy evaluation for plain cement concrete,concrete; fracture mechanics; finite-element and notched specimen,PARAMETERS,"The present work deals with the investigation of a robust analytical scheme to assess the size-independent fracture energy of concrete.

The unique nonlinear behaviour of concrete 1material is incorporated through fracture energy-based strain-softening model in the finite-element numerical simulation. The International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems and Structures (RILEM) fracture energy values are evaluated through numerical simulation of several set of experimentally observed load-load line displacement response.

Application of adaptive neuro-fuzzy technique to predict the unconfined compressive strength of PFA-sand-cement mixture,"Pulverized fuel ash; Ground improvement; Unconfined compressive strength; Soft computing, ANFIS; Enhancement",FLY-ASH; INFERENCE SYSTEM; ANFIS; NETWORK; DISPOSAL; CONCRETE; SOIL,"The paper addresses the application of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) computing technique to predict the unconfined compressive strength of the pulverized fuel ash-cement-sand mixture. A series of unconfined compressive tests were performed on several mixtures of cement, pulverized fuel ash (PFA), and sand for checking and training data for the ANFIS network. Although some mathematical functions were applied to model the unconfined compressive strength of the construction materials, numerous setbacks of the models were observed. The artificial neural network (ANN) can be used as an analytical method for various prediction purposes because it provides the benefit of independency on the knowledge of internal system parameters, compressed compact solution in terms of multi-variable problems and rapid computation. The ANFIS is a particular class of the ANN family with attractive estimation and learning potentials. This provides a suitable platform when the analysis is aimed to counter the uncertainties in a system. The ANFIS RMSE was 0.0617 for prediction of the unconfined compressive strength of the pulverized fuel ash-cement-sand mixture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015

The development of UWB antennas with proper dimensions and high performance for these systems is one of the major challenges. In this letter, an antipodal Vivaldi antenna (AVA) has been developed to be used in UWB techniques for nondestructive detection of cracks in concrete members. To obtain a desirable antenna performance including the wider impedance bandwidth, the higher directivity, and higher front-to-back ratio rectangular-shaped slits (RSS) and a half-circular-shaped lens (HCSL) have been added in the design of a conventional tapered slot AVA. A parametric study on the dimensions of the slits is provided to optimize performance and size of the proposed antenna. The optimum size of the proposed antenna is 40 x 80 x 0.508 mm(3), and it operates over the frequency range from 3.4-40 GHz. It is shown that the RSS increase impedance bandwidth especially at the lower frequencies. Directivity of the proposed antenna at higher frequencies has been increased by the HCSL. The feasibility of the proposed antenna for nondestructive evaluation of concrete members is demonstrated by investigation into its performance with concrete specimens possessing an air-gap inside a concrete specimen.

The contribution of ISO 14067 to the evolution of global greenhouse gas standards-A review,Carbon footprint; GHG quantification; GHG communication; ISO 14067,ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT METHODS; CARBON-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; LIFE-CYCLE; CONCRETE; FRAMEWORK; FOOTPRINT; TRENDS,"Due to the increasing recognition of global climate change, the building and construction industries are under pressure to reduce carbon emissions. A central issue in striving towards reduced carbon emissions is the need for a practicable and meaningful yardstick for assessing and communicating greenhouse gas (GHG) results. ISO 14067 was published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in May 2013. By providing specific requirements in the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, the standard clarifies the GHG assessment in the aspects of choosing system boundaries and simulating use and end-of-life phases when quantifying carbon footprint of products (CFPs). More importantly, the standard, for the first time, provides a step-to-step guide and standardized template for communicating CFPs in the form of CFP external communication report, CFP performance tracking report, CFP declaration and CFP label. ISO 14067 therefore makes a valuable contribution to GHG quantification and transparent communication and comparison of CFPs. In addition, as cradle-to-grave should be used as the system boundary and end-of-life phases can be simulated, ISO 14067 will hopefully promote the development and implementation of simulation technologies, with Building Information Modelling (BIM) in particular, in the building and construction industries.

Combinations of building construction material for residential building for the global warming mitigation for Malaysia,Building materials defect; Environmental impact; Climate change; Sustainability; Life cycle assessment,GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; LIFE-CYCLE; ENERGY; WOOD; SELECTION; DESIGN; COSTS,"Global warming mitigation is used as a key to devise built environment strategies and sustainable policies in developed countries that aim to reduce the rate of carbon emissions. The goal of this research is to mitigate global warming from building construction by suggesting an alternative building scheme for Malaysia. A problem related to the building industry is releasing carbon dioxide emission. Use of timber for construction has less impact on the environment due to less carbon dioxide emissions, thus making wood the best material for wall construction. However, as the Malaysian climate is hot and humid, wood encounters many defects and deteriorates. Presently, most buildings in Malaysia are built from other materials such as concrete or brick. In the last 40 years, wood materials in building schemes in Malaysia have dropped from 60% to almost 5%. This research proposed a new approach to minimize the effect of CO2 emission for buildings as well as to improve their structural stability for a longer lifespan because these would encourage the Malaysian construction industry to use wood components in their building schemes. In this study, SIMAPRO Software was used to assess CO2 emissions caused by seven different types of building schemes in wall constructions. The results from a simulation of three time frames of twenty, one hundred and five hundred years showed that timber scheme is the best choice for construction. To promote the use of timber, a new building scheme that would solve the problem of timber wood structure in Malaysia were proposed. The alternative building scheme has combined precast concrete and timber (H8) to improve the timber scheme deficiency while releasing less CO2 emissions compared to other systems. Therefore (H8) could replace current building schemes. This research can facilitate decision-maker to choose the most flexible scheme for Malaysian housing. Thus, this system could be positively and widely used in the Malaysian construction industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015
Study of radiation dose reduction of buildings of different sizes and materials,radioactive cesium; Monte Carlo calculation; wooden house; concrete building; radiation protection; radiation dose reduction; indoor; radiation shielding; PHITS,EXPOSURES; CHILDREN; ADULTS,"The dependence of radiation dose reduction on the sizes and materials of buildings was studied by numerical analyses using the Monte Carlo simulation code, PHITS. The dose rates inside the buildings were calculated by simulating gamma-ray transport from radioactive cesium deposited at the ground surface. Three building models were developed: the wooden house, the open-space concrete building, and the thin-wall building, to study the effect of building size and construction material on dose reduction inside these structures. Here the floor-area sizes of the building models were varied to clarify the influence of building configuration on dose reduction. The results demonstrated that the dose rates inside the buildings linearly decreased with increasing floor area on a logarithmic scale for all types of buildings considered. The calculated dose distribution inside a building indicated that the distance from the outer walls was a determining factor for the dose rate at each position in the building. The obtained tendency was verified by comparison with data reflecting the dose reduction of typical buildings in Japan.",2015
Investigation of Ultra-high Performance Concrete Under Static and Blast Loads,steel fibre; nano-additive; UHPC; static tests; blast tests; numerical simulation,FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STRUCTURAL RESPONSE; CEMENT COMPOSITE; IMPACT; PREDICTION; DAMAGE; SLABS,"Conventional concrete works as an important construction material. However, conventional concrete is known to be brittle and prone to tensile failure and cracks. To overcome such defects and improve the dynamic performance of concrete against extreme loading conditions, concrete with different additions and formulae have been developed. In a recent study, to develop ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) material with better strength and crack control ability, super fine aggregates with high pozzolanic effect were mixed into the steel fibre reinforced concrete instead of the traditional graded coarse aggregates. Furthermore, to achieve high early age strength, nanoscale additives which can accelerate the hydration process of the ordinary Portland cement were also introduced into the concrete composite. A series of uniaxial compression and four-point bending tests had been performed in the laboratory to get the material properties of this innovative concrete material. Great improvement of the concrete uniaxial compressive strength and flexural tensile strength was observed. Field blast tests were carried out on columns made of this UHPC material. Superior blast resistance performance was observed. In the current study, based on the available test data, numerical models are developed and numerical simulations are carried out. The simulation results are found to comply well with the experimental results.",2015
Usage of steel slag in concrete as fine and/or coarse aggregate,Steel Slag; Limestone; Concrete; Aggregate,CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL; EAF SLAG; DURABILITY; HYDRATION,"In this study, the use of steel slag as fine and/or coarse aggregate in concrete is investigated. For this purpose, 12 different concrete mixtures with different water/cement ratios of 0.40, 0.55 and 0.70 which include steel slag aggregate as fine and/or coarse aggregate are prepared. Compressive strength, split tensile strength, flexural strength, freeze-thaw resistance and water penetration depth of concrete mixtures containing steel slag aggregate are examined in comparison with concrete mixtures prepared by using crushed limestone aggregate. Eventually, concrete mixtures containing coarse steel slag show better performance than concrete mixtures containing limestone aggregate. Concrete mixtures containing fine steel slag show worse performance in comparison with concrete mixtures containing limestone aggregate.",2015
Estimation of Prestress Force Distribution in the Multi-Strand System of Prestressed Concrete Structures,optical fiber sensor; elastomagnetic sensor; prestressed concrete; strand,STEEL STRAND; SENSORS,"Prestressed concrete (PSC) is one of the most reliable, durable and widely used construction materials, which overcomes the weakness of concrete in tension by the introduction of a prestress force. Smart strands enabling measurement of the prestress force have recently been developed to maintain PSC structures throughout their lifetime. However, the smart strand cannot give a representative indication of the whole prestress force when used in multi-strand systems since each strand sustains a different prestress force. In this paper, the actual distribution of the prestress force in a multi-strand system is examined using elastomagnetic (EM) sensors to develop a method for tracking representative indicators of the prestress force using smart strands.",2015
Development of construction materials using nano-silica and aggregates recycled from construction and demolition waste,Colloidal nano-silica; compressive strength; density; recycled aggregate concrete; water absorption; volume of voids,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COARSE AGGREGATE; POZZOLANIC MATERIALS; CONCRETE AGGREGATE; CEMENT MORTAR; STRENGTH; DURABILITY; RESISTANCE; FIELD; ASH,"The present work addresses the development of novel construction materials utilising commercial grade nano-silica and recycled aggregates retrieved from construction and demolition waste. For this, experimental work has been carried out to examine the influence of nano-silica and recycled aggregates on compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, water absorption, density and volume of voids of concrete. Fully natural and recycled aggregate concrete mixes are designed by replacing cement with three levels (0.75%, 1.5% and 3%) of nano-silica. The results of the present investigation depict that improvement in early days compressive strength is achieved with the incorporation of nano-silica in addition to the restoration of reduction in compressive strength of recycled aggregate concrete mixes caused owing to the replacement of natural aggregates by recycled aggregates. Moreover, the increase in water absorption and volume of voids with a reduction of bulk density was detected with the incorporation of recycled aggregates in place of natural aggregates. However, enhancement in density and reduction in water absorption and volume of voids of recycled aggregate concrete resulted from the addition of nano-silica. In addition, the results of the study reveal that nano-silica has no significant effect on elastic modulus of concrete.",2015
Flexural behaviour of recycled aggregate concrete graded slabs,recycled aggregate concrete (RAC); graded slab; flexural behaviour; bending stiffness; FEM analysis; building materials; construction materials; design and construction; testing; experiments,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; BEAMS; PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITE,"This paper proposes a new concept for recycled aggregate concrete graded slabs, which can be achieved through graded distribution for the mechanical properties of the recycled aggregate concrete (RAC). In this study, one four-point bending test was used to investigate six RAC graded slabs and three homogeneous slabs with RAC. The major parameters considered were the layers with different recycled coarse aggregates (RCAs) replacement percentages (0, 50 and 100%), the grading pattern (different casting methods) and the reinforcement ratio. It has been concluded that RAC graded slabs have similar flexural behaviour to that of homogeneous slabs with RAC. The reinforcement ratio, the layers with different RCA replacement percentages and the grading pattern can influence the flexural behaviour of RAC graded slabs. Furthermore, the effects of the three factors on both the flexural capacity and the deflection of the RAC graded slabs were studied with finite element method (FEM) simulation using ABAQUS software. Both the experiments and the FEM analysis indicate that the flexural behaviour of RAC slabs can be improved by using this suitable grading method.",2015
A design approach for tunnels exposed to blast and fire,internal tunnel explosion; fire; fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC); fire-blast interaction; pressure-impulse diagram; fib Model Code 2010; building materials; construction materials; dynamic actions; earthquakes; tunnelling,CONCRETE; MODEL,"A design procedure based on a simplified FE model for underground tunnels subjected to internal explosion and possibly preceded by fire accidents is proposed in this article. The procedure can provide a valuable tool for designers who have to check the structural safety of a tunnel for the case of an internal blast event. The tunnel geometry considered is the same adopted for the metro line in Brescia, Italy. It has an internal diameter of about 8.15 m, is about 13.7 km long and is located about 23.1 m below the surface. Six segments and a smaller key segment (6+1) make up the tunnel. The ring has an average width of about 1.5 m. The FE model is first tested under static serviceability loads. Dynamic analyses are carried out in order to reproduce the blast scenario. The aim of this work is to generate pressure-impulse (p-i) diagrams for underground tunnels for the case of internal explosion and pre-explosion fire actions. An ultimate limit state criterion based on the eccentric ultimate flexural capacity and capable of including fire-blast interaction is introduced. An innovative layered precast tunnel segment solution made of different fibre-reinforced cementitious composites is compared with a traditional solution with the lining section made of reinforced concrete. The potential applications of this new solution are also discussed in the paper.",2015
Self-repair of thermal cracks in concrete sandwich panels,self-healing; precast concrete sandwich panel; thermal cracks; encapsulation; polyurethane; water-repellent agent; building materials; construction materials; building maintenance; refurbishment; testing; experiments,CONTINUED HYDRATION; STRENGTH CONCRETE; PERMEABILITY; EXTENT,"Although the use of insulated concrete sandwich panels results in more energy-efficient buildings, the presence of this insulation layer can induce thermal cracks. As cracks form a preferential path for aggressive agents to enter and degrade the concrete matrix, and as they are not wanted in this application from an aesthetical point of view, they need to be treated. The aim of this study was to seal the cracks in concrete sandwich panels invisibly in an autonomous way. Therefore, the efficiency of various encapsulated healing agents was compared by inducing thermal cracks in concrete sandwich panels, thus causing capsule breakage and the release of the agents into the cracks. It was shown that encapsulation of both polyurethane and a water-repellent agent can result in a reduction in the water uptake by cracks. However, only when a water-repellent agent was released cracks were healed in an almost invisible way. This study has shown that the self-healing approach involving encapsulated polymer-based healing agents can also be applied to concrete sandwich panels, although more research will be needed to meet the specific healing requirements of this application.",2015
Chloride ion transport mechanism in concrete due to wetting and drying cycles,concrete; durability; drying-wetting cycles; simulation analysis; testing; experiments; building materials; construction materials; building maintenance; refurbishment,MIGRATION TESTS; PENETRATION; TRANSMISSION; COEFFICIENTS; DIFFUSION; EXPOSURE; INGRESS; STATE; MODEL,"The transport mechanism of chloride ions in concrete during wetting and drying cycles of varying duration is evaluated in this paper. The experimental test results were used to validate a numerical simulation model in order to assess the influence of diffusion coefficient, surface chloride ion concentration and ratio of dry-wet cycle durations on the transport mechanism of chloride ions in concrete. Experimental and numerical analysis results indicate that the maximum transmission depth of chloride ions in concrete depends on the diffusion coefficient and the dry-wet cycle regime but has little relationship with the surface concentration of chloride. The chloride ion transmission in the surface zone accelerates only if the dry-wet ratio is > 1. As the dry-wet ratio increases, so the chloride ion transmission accelerates. It tends to become stable when the dry-wet ratio reaches 5:1. The dry-wet cycles accelerate the transport process of chloride ions within a certain distance from the surface; beyond this distance, chloride ions in the complete immersion specimen migrate more rapidly than those under dry-wet cycles. The peak concentration of chloride ions within the convection zone has a relationship with the diffusion coefficient, the surface chloride ion concentration and the dry-wet regime. The smaller the diffusion coefficient, the higher the surface chloride concentration; the greater the dry-wet ratio, the higher the peak of convection can be.",2015
Effect of the location of broken wire wraps on the failure pressure of prestressed concrete cylinder pipes,prestressed concrete cylinder pipes; embedded cylinder pipes; finite element analysis; fluid pressure; numerical analysis; sensitivity analysis; building materials; construction materials; analysis and design methods; prestressed concrete; reinforcement,IMMERSED TUNNEL,"The effect of the location of broken prestressing wire wraps on the overall strength of prestressed concrete cylinder pipes (PCCP) is investigated here. An advanced computational model based on non-linear finite element analysis is used to study three possible locations of broken wire wraps: at the spigot joint, at the bell joint and in the barrel of the pipe. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the cracking of the concrete core and the yielding of the prestressing wires and steel cylinder with increasing internal pressure and with an increasing number of broken wire wraps. Two classes of 2.44 m embedded cylinder pipe (ECP) were modelled with 5, 35, 70, and 100 wire wrap breaks. The results show that broken wire wraps at the joint, and especially the spigot joint, decrease the overall strength of PCCP more so than those at the bell joint or in the barrel of the pipe. The intensity of this effect increases with increasing internal pressure and with a larger number of broken wire wraps.",2015
Recyclability of bottom ash mixed with dredged soils according to the transportation distance and mixing ratio through the estimation of CO2 emissions,Recycled materials; Bottom ash; Dredged soil; CO2 emissions; Transportation,BY-PRODUCTS; CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE; SUSTAINABILITY; BUILDINGS; AGGREGATE; SEDIMENT; STRENGTH; REUSE,"Bottom ash and dredged soils can be used as construction materials because they are similar in physical characteristics to natural aggregates. However, whenever such byproducts as bottom ash and dredgea soils are used, the energy efficiency of recycling is offset to a certain degree by emissions from transportation. The objective of this study is to analyze the environmental efficiency of recycling bottom ash and dredged soils through the estimation of CO2 emissions, considering both transportation distance and the mixing ratio. Agricultural reservoirs were selected as the final destinations of these recycled materials. This analysis demonstrated that using 100% bottom ash emits less CO2 than using natural aggregates when the ash is transported less than 35.15 km. This breakeven distance increases exponentially with the mass fraction of admixed dredged soil. However, admixture with natural soils does not affect the breakeven distance. Using the breakeven distances, the effective area with which it is efficient to recycle bottom ash was delineated. When dredged soil is admixed to a mass fraction of 70%, the effective area covers most of South Korea. In addition, 100% bottom ash was efficient in 1622 reservoirs (9.45%) in terms of CO2 emissions, and the mixture with 30% bottom ash and 70% dredged soils is efficient in 98.83% of all of the reservoirs in Korea. Bottom ash is most useful for reducing CO2 emissions when it is mixed with dredged soils, which are a byproduct of construction found on-site. This result is meaningful because bottom ash and dredged soils are complementary in their physical characteristics, and they need to be mixed before use as construction materials. The recycling of bottom ash becomes even more attractive with anticipated improvements in fuel efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015
Laboratory Evaluation of the Use of Cement-Treated Construction and Demolition Materials in Pavement Base and Subbase Applications,,RECYCLED CONCRETE AGGREGATE; RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT; CALCIUM CARBIDE RESIDUE; CRUSHED GLASS; BLENDS; STABILIZATION; PERFORMANCE; RESPONSES; WASTE; BRICK,"Construction and demolition (C&D) materials constitute a major proportion of waste materials present in landfills worldwide. With the scarcity of high-quality quarry aggregates, alternative materials, such as C&D materials, are increasingly being considered as a replacement for traditional road-construction materials, particularly as the sustainable usage of these C&D materials has significant environmental benefits. In this research, an extensive laboratory evaluation was carried out to determine the engineering properties of cement-treated C&D materials. The C&D materials investigated were reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), and crushed brick (CB). The geotechnical properties of cement-treated C&D materials were evaluated to assess their performance in pavement base/subbase applications. The effect of curing duration on the strength of the C&D materials was analyzed by conducting unconfined compression strength and repeated load triaxial tests. The RAP required 2% cement (by weight) and either 7 or 28days of curing to meet the local road-authority requirements, whereas RCA and CB required 4% cement and 28days of curing. The RAP exhibited the highest strength in all cases, with the same cement content and for the same curing duration, followed by RCA and CB. The resilient moduli of C&D materials increased with an increase in cement content, curing duration, and confining pressure. Humidity curing was found to play an important role in the strength development of cement-treated C&D materials. This study indicates that cement-treated C&D materials are viable construction materials for pavement base/subbase applications.",2015
NATURAL CORROSION INHIBITORS FOR STEEL REINFORCEMENT IN CONCRETE - A REVIEW,Corrosion; corrosion inhibitor; natural products; reinforcement steel; concrete; review,EXTRACT; PERFORMANCE; ENVIRONMENT; MEDIA,"Reinforced concrete is one of the widely used construction materials for bridges, buildings, platforms and tunnels. Though reinforced concrete is capable of withstanding a large range of severe environments including marine, industrial and alpine conditions, there are still a large number of failures in concrete structures for many reasons. Either carbonation or chloride attack is the main culprit which is due to depassivation of reinforced steel and subsequently leads to rapid steel corrosion. Among many corrosion prevention measures, application of corrosion inhibitors play a vital role in metal protection. Numerous range of corrosion inhibitors were reported for concrete protection that were also used commercially in industries. This review summarizes the application of natural products as corrosion inhibitors for concrete protection and also scrutinizes various factors influencing its applicability.",2015
Properties of cement-lime mortars vs. cement mortars containing recycled concrete aggregates,Mortar; Hydration; Recycled aggregates; Mechanical properties; Microstructure,PERFORMANCE; WASTE; CONSTRUCTION; BEHAVIOR,"Cement based materials have a very special presence amongst building and construction materials, and therefore their recycling is of capital importance. In this research, concrete wastes were used as replacement of natural aggregates in cement and cement-lime mortars. The mortars were cured for 28-days with an increasing substitution of fine natural aggregates with recycled aggregates and have been prepared as well as characterized. The results show that, as expected, cement mortars always have better mechanical properties than the corresponding cement-lime mortars. A worsening of mechanical properties is observed upon increasing the amount of recycled aggregates in the cement mortars; on the contrary, cement-lime mortars show an improvement in mechanical properties of up to 60% when increasing the amount of recycled aggregates. The experimental results suggest that this improvement could arise from a synergic effect of lime hydraulicity and the filler effect due to the fine fraction of recycled aggregates within the mix, that lead to better densification of the lime mortars by blocking the capillary pores.

Modulus of rupture evaluation of cement stabilized recycled glass/recycled concrete aggregate blends,Fatigue strength; Cement stabilization; Recycled glass; Recycled concrete; Modulus of rupture,RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT; CONSTRUCTION; SUBBASES; BRICK; GLASS; BASES,"Construction and Demolition (C&D) wastes are increasingly used as construction material in a range of civil engineering applications. Fine Recycled Glass (FRG) is collected at municipal kerbsides and its usage to date has been limited to unbound pavement layers. This research was undertaken to evaluate the performance of FRG as a supplementary material in blends with cement stabilized recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). Laboratory evaluation was undertaken on the RCA/FRG blends with 10%, 20% and 30% FRG content and stabilized with 3% medium setting General Blend (GB) cement. The laboratory evaluation was comprised of pH, plasticity index, foreign materials content, particle size distribution, linear shrinkage, California Bearing Ratio, modified Proctor compaction, Repeated Load Triaxial test, Unconfined Compressive Strength test and flexural beam tests. The cement stabilized RCA/FRG blends with up to 30% FRG content were found to have physical properties, which comply with the local state road authority requirements. The results of Repeated Load Triaxial tests indicated the RCA/FRG blends performed well with 30% FRG content just on the border line for bound pavement material. Unconfined Compression Strengths met the minimum requirement for 7 days of curing for all blends, while the 28 day strength of the blends showed a significant improvement with curing. The results of the flexural beam tests were noted to be consistent with past works with cement stabilized virgin quarry rock products. The modulus of rupture and flexural modulus for all the cement-stabilized RCA/FRG blends indicate that these blends are suitable for applications such as cement-stabilized pavement bases/subbases. The fatigue life was also within the range previously reported for quarry materials. The cement-stabilized blends with FRG as a supplementary material with up to 30% FRG content and 3% GB cement were found to have physical and strength properties, which would comply with road authority requirements.

It is associated with circular economy system (CE), propagated by the European Union. Circular economy systems keep the added value in products for as long as possible and virtually eliminate waste. Transition to a more circular economy requires changes throughout value chains, from product design to new business and market models, from new ways of turning waste into a resource to new modes of consumer behaviour. These actions relate to all industries, including the construction industry. Nowdays, the increase in demand for construction materials as a result of development has called for an alternative way to develop or derive construction materials from different sources, including sewage sludge ash (SSA). SSA is produced after the firing. process of sewage sludge, and it must be disposed by other means. Researches were already accomplished investigating the use of sewage sludge ash for the building materials manufacturing, such as produce bricks and tiles, as a raw materials for cement production, as aggregates for concrete and mortar, as a component of the synthesis of lightweight materials and as substitute for sand and/or cement in cement stabilized bases, subbases and embankments in road constuctions. A detailed description of each application as a way towards a circular economy is presented in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015
Environmental footprint of constructed wetlands treating wastewater,constructed wetlands; HDPE life cycle assessment; vertical flow; horizontal subsurface flow; municipal wastewater treatment; concrete; clay; Anaerobic tank,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SLUDGE TREATMENT; IMPACT ASSESSMENT; TECHNOLOGIES; SYSTEM,"The aim of the study is to determine environmentally friendlier construction materials for constructed wetland facilities treating wastewater. This is done by computing the environmental footprint of the facility based on the methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA). This methodology reveals the dominant aggravating processes during the construction of a constructed wetland (CW) and can help to create alternative environmentally friendlier solutions. This methodology was applied for the determination of the overall environmental profile of a hybrid CW facility. The LCA was applied first to the facility as originally designed, where reinforced concrete was used in some components. Then, alternative construction materials to reinforced concrete were used, such as earth covered with high density polyethylene (HDPE) or clay, and LCA was applied again. Earth structures were found to have reduced environmental impact compared to concrete ones, and clay was found environmentally friendlier compared to HDPE. Furthermore, estimation of the construction costs of the three scenarios indicate that the last scenario is also the least expensive.",2015

Development of the new boron products and production technologies, spreading the using area of the boron are the study topics which must be finically discussed. In this study, with the help of colemanite taken in ratio as (0%, 7.5%, 12.5%, and 17.5%) by being mixed by the cement, surfaces of the pumice aggregates have been covered. Permeability of the samples has been investigated by producing lightweight concrete with 400 dose with the help of aggregates covered with colemanite. For this, the experiments of water absorption, capillary water absorption, depth of penetration of water under pressure and rapid chloride permeability have been performed. In addition, analyses of the thin section of covered and uncovered pumice aggregates and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) have been investigated.

Responses of roadside soil cation pools to vehicular emission deposition in southern California,Soil acidification; Roadside soil; Urban soil; Potassium; Calcium; Magnesium,SAN-BERNARDINO MOUNTAINS; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; ACID PRECIPITATION; FOREST ECOSYSTEM; SATURATION; ALUMINUM; CALCIUM; DEPLETION; METAL; WATER,"Roadside soils are heavily loaded with reactive nitrogen due to vehicular emissions, and these loadings likely acidify near-road soils. Cationic metals are mobilized from acidified soils during exchange reactions. Depletion of soil cation pools is well documented in forest soils, but poorly understood in roadside soils despite heavy nitrogen loadings to roadside environments and the continued growth of road networks. This study considers soil acidification impacts across gradients of soil chemistry, road network density, climate, and geology in southern California, clarifying acidification processes in near-road environments. Although there is no direct relationship between soil pH and road proximity, several elements (Al, Be, K) are depleted in near-road environments. The depletion of these elements occurs despite more sediment surface area and organic matter in near-road soils. In contrast, the weathering of road construction materials (i.e., concrete) replenishes soil Ca and Mg pools and likely buffers soil pH. These observed near-road patterns in soil chemistry point to the potential for mobilization of metal contamination from roadside environments. Improved understanding of metal dynamics in roadside soils is essential to the effective management of road-sourced nutrients and storm water, particularly as expanding road networks continue to affect wider areas.",2015
Engineering and environmental properties of foamed recycled glass as a lightweight engineering material,Lightweight material; Embankment fill; Foam glass; Waste materials,MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; EPS GEOFOAM; RETAINING STRUCTURES; DEMOLITION MATERIALS; CRUSHED GLASS; UNIT WEIGHT; FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; CONSTRUCTION; STRENGTH,"Lightweight fill materials, including foamed aggregates are increasingly being used in civil engineering and infrastructure applications. This research assessed the engineering properties of foamed recycled glass through a laboratory evaluation to ascertain this novel recycled material as a lightweight fill material in civil engineering applications. The engineering assessment included particle size distribution, particle density, water absorption, minimum and maximum dry densities with a vibrating table, California Bearing Ratio (CBR) and Los Angeles (LA) abrasion tests. Shear strength properties of the recycled foamed glass were studied through large-scale direct shear tests. This recycled foamed glass is classified as a gap graded material. Due to high porosity, the coarse particles of this material have high water absorption of 60% and low particle density of 4.54 kN/m(3), which is much lower than that of water. The minimum and maximum dry densities of this material are very low of 1.67 and 2.84 kN/m(3), respectively. The LA abrasion of foamed recycled glass is lower than the requirement for pavement base/subbase material, being of 94%. The shear resistance at small shear displacement is thus low as shown by low CBR value of 9-12%. However, the shear resistance at large shear displacement is high as shown by high cohesion and friction angle of 23.36 kPa and 54.7 degrees, respectively. The environmental assessment included pH value, organic content, total and leachate concentration of the material for a range of contaminant constituents. All the hazardous concentrations in the leachate are far lower than 100 times of those of the drinking water standards, indicating the foamed recycled glass as a non-hazardous material. The energy savings assessment demonstrates that the use of foamed recycled glass as engineering material has much lower energy consumption relative to a conventional aggregate-cement material in construction projects. The lightweight properties of the foamed recycled glass coupled with its satisfactory engineering and environmental results, particularly its high friction angle, indicates that the material is ideal for usage as a lightweight construction material in engineering applications such as non-structural fills in embankments, retaining wall backfill and pipe bedding.

Solidification/stabilization and leaching behavior of PbCl2 in fly-ash hydrated silicate matrix and fly-ash geopolymer matrix,Fly ash; Construction material; Hydrated silicate; Geopolymer; Lead; Leaching; Solidification/stabilization,CEMENT; LEAD; STABILIZATION; CONCRETE; SLAG; PB; IMMOBILIZATION; BINDING; SYSTEMS; METAL,"Fly ash (FA) for reuse as a construction material is activated using two methods, to produce hydrated silicate and geopolymer gels. We investigated the solidification/stabilization and leaching behavior of PbCl2 in a geopolymer matrix (GM) and hydrated silicate matrix (HSM), based on FA as the source material, to evaluate the environmental and health risks. The GM and HSM synthetic conditions were 60 A degrees C, 20 % relative humidity (RH), and 12 wt% (6 mol/L) NaOH, and 20 A +/- 2 A degrees C, a parts per thousand yen90 % RH, and 30 wt.%, respectively, based on their compressive strength performances. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that Pb participated in hydration and geopolymerization, and was incorporated in the structural components of the hydrated silicate and geopolymer. In leaching experiments, the solidification/stabilization effects of Pb and Cl in the HSM and GM improved with increasing curing time. After long-term curing (28 days), the immobility of Pb in the GM was better than that in the HSM. Sodalite improved the Cl-stabilizing ability of the GM compared with that of the HSM. In static monolithic leaching experiments, HSM and GM had the same Pb-leaching behaviors. Based on the changes in the location of the neutral sphere layer with decreasing acid-neutralizing capacity, Pb release was divided into alkaline-release, stagnation, and acid-release stages. The neutral sphere layer contained the highest Pb concentration during permeation toward the block center from the block edge. This behavior regulation could also apply to other amphoteric metals immobilized by GMs and HSMs.",2015
Effect of Silica Fume and Wood Ash Additions on Flexural and Splitting Tensile Strength of Lightweight Foamed Concrete,Foamed concrete; sustainable; wood ash; silica fume; flexural; building material,,"Reducing building material costs by identifying sustainable and green construction materials is desirable for economic reasons and environmental responsibility. This study examines ways to enhance strength of foamed concrete by adding wood ash (WA) and silica fume (SF). The effect of different percentage combinations is investigated, to understand the effect on the flexural and splitting tensile strengths. The supplementary binders replace a percentage by weight of the cement and are blended with foamed concrete. The WA-SF mixes at 5%-15%, 10%-10%, and 15%-5%, were compared to standard foamed concrete. The microstructures show evidence of novel densification and there was an improvement in the flexural and tensile strengths. The 5% WA-15% SF mix has the most significant effect on the foamed concrete compared to the control. The binder matrix also prolonged the setting time of the cement paste.",2015

This is due to the need to use plants that do not affect the food supply when used for power generation from biomass. Agave salmiana residues meet these characteristics. It has now been proposed as a possible source of bioenergy production because of its growth characteristics. Therefore, in this research, the effect of combustion temperature of the A. salmiana as it could happen in the energy production was studied. In addition, the characteristics of these residues were analyzed to serve as a basis for possible future applications in construction materials. Results indicate that the ashes are mainly CaCO3 when calcined at below 700 degrees C, and CaO above this temperature. The apparent particle size was between 25 and 32 mu m. However, it is observed that it consists of much smaller particles of approximately 300 nm. This reduction in size is related to decomposition at higher temperatures and is reflected in the increase of the specific area up to 70%. The compression strength at early ages was up to 90% higher than a reference, when 5% cement replacement mixes were performed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2015
Microstructure and mechanical properties of cementless construction materials from thermal engineering wastes,Ceramics industry; Fired/unfired wastes; Lime production wastes; Structures formation processes; Mechanical properties; Environment protection,RECYCLED CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR; DURABILITY; AGGREGATE,"In order to solve environment problems of ceramics industry new compositions of materials were developed from three types of porcelain production tails - fired wastes (FW), unfired wastes (UW) and wastewater treatment plant sludge (WTPS) - as the main raw materials of new compositions of cementless building materials. The binder material used here was lime production waste (LPW), i.e., incompletely burned lime. The uniaxial compressive strength of the new materials containing 15 wt% of LPW at one year of age increased up to 14.2 MPa and the materials with 5% LPW content increased up to 8.6 MPa, exceeding the specifications of Brazilian standards for hollow concrete blocks. The water absorption (W-A) coefficient of different compositions at the age of 28 days ranged from 17.9 to 24.6%, but this does not affect the values of the water resistance coefficient (0.71-0.85). X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses indicated that the strength of the new materials increases due to the synthesis of amorphous and crystalline compounds. The feasibility of the new materials based on the use of four types of industrial wastes for the production of new building materials with high mechanical properties, which meet the requirements of national standards.

From a resource perspective, there could be benefits from using excavated soil and rock as a construction material. The aim of this paper is to describe the material flow and management practices of urban excavated soil and rock from the perspective of resource efficiency. A conceptual model for the urban flow of excavated soil and rock was developed and a literature review concerning the management of excavated soil and rock was conducted. The conceptual model was subsequently used to clarify the different perspectives of the scientific literature and knowledge gaps. Conclusions drawn are that there is little knowledge about the quantities and the fate of excavated soil and rock in urban areas. Current research is focusing on the waste flows of construction material and little is known about the overall management practices of excavated soil and rock. Clearly, excavated soil and rock are often disposed at landfills and the recycling rate for high quality purposes is low. There is a need to evaluate the potential for an increased use of excavated soil and rock as construction material. However, the overall efficiency of urban construction material management can only be evaluated and improved by also including construction materials produced in quarries. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this paper, an experimental study was carried on 12 concrete filled steel tubular columns under axial loading, in order to fill a knowledge gap on the engineering and structural properties of GRC filled steel tube (GRCFST). Two section sizes of square hollow sections filled with GRC and recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) respectively, with different recycled aggregate (RA) replacement ratios of 0%, 50% and 100%, were used in the experiments. The test results indicated that the ultimate strength was reduced when adding more RAs in the columns, while the peak strain increased; The ductility of the columns was improved by increasing the RA replacement ratio. Overall, the influence of RA on the strength and ductility of GRCFST columns is greater than that of RAC filled steel tubular (RACFST) columns. The assumed theoretical model for predicting load versus deformation relation of GRCFST columns under axial loading was examined, and a revised theoretical model proposed. The results of the new model show good correlation with the experimental results. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015

Australia produces approximately 30 million tonnes of finished building products each year, with over 56% of this quantity, by mass, being attributed to concrete and a further 6%, steel. Globally, 23 trillion kilograms of concrete alone is consumed annually, with growing population driving increasing demands. This study assesses the environmental performance of various concrete slab systems. Historically, the focus of environmental performance in buildings has been Operation Energy (OE) requirements, however Zero Energy Buildings (ZEB) are changing this. Specifically the study investigates the environmental performance of concrete structures varying design parameters and construction techniques to optimise its embodied energy (EE). These structures are designed in accordance with all relevant Australian codes and standards. The various slab systems investigated include: beam & slab, flat slab and flat plates while concurrently considering the use of conventionally reinforced and post-tensioned construction methods. Designs were compared in terms of EE outcomes given fixed design criteria, with results indicating reductions between 23.7% and 49.1% when utilising post-tensioned construction methods.

Evaluation of the performance of recycled textile fibres in the mechanical behaviour of a gypsum and cork composite material,Industrial by-products; Textile fibres; Composite material; Mechanical characterization; Uniaxial compression; Mode I fracture energy,GAS DESULFURIZATION GYPSUM; THERMAL-PROPERTIES; BUILDING-MATERIALS; CEMENT; CONCRETE; MORTAR,"Given the need for using more sustainable constructive solutions, an innovative composite material based on a combination of distinct industrial by-products is proposed aiming to reduce waste and energy consumption in the production of construction materials. The raw materials are thermal activated fluegas desulphurization (FGD) gypsum, which acts as a binder, granulated cork as the aggregate and recycled textile fibres from used tyres intended to reinforce the material. This paper presents the results of the design of the composite mortar mixes, the characterization of the key physical properties (density, porosity and ultrasonic pulse velocity) and the mechanical validation based on uniaxial compressive tests and fracture energy tests. In the experimental campaign, the influence of the percentage of the raw materials in terms of gypsum mass, on the mechanical properties of the composite material was assessed. It was observed that the percentage of granulated cork decreases the compressive strength of the composite material but contributes to the increase in the compressive fracture energy. Besides, the recycled textile fibres play an important role in the mode I fracture process and in the fracture energy of the composite material, resulting in a considerable increase in the mode I fracture energy.

Effect of marble waste fines on rheological and hardened properties of sand concrete,sand concrete; marble waste; mechanical properties; fines; rheological properties,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,"Faced with the growing needs of material resources and requirements of environmental protection for achieving sustainable development, it has become necessary to study and investigate all possibilities of exploring crushed and dune sand, reusing industrial wastes and by-product, and also applying new technologies including sand concrete which can replace the conventional concretes in certain structures to surmount the deficit on construction materials, conserve natural resources, lessen the burden of pollutants to protect the environment and reduce the consumption of energy sources. This experimental study is a part of development and valorization of local materials project in Skikda region (East of Algeria). It aims at studying the effects of partial replacement of sand with marble waste as fines on several fresh and hardened properties of sand concrete in order to reuse these wastes in the concrete manufacturing, resolve the environmental problems caused by them and find another source of construction materials. To achieve these objectives, an experimental program has been carried out; it was consisted to incorporate different percentages of marble waste fines (2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12%) in the formulations of sand concrete and study the development of several mechanical and rheological properties. We are also trying to find the optimal percentage of marble waste fine replaced in sand concrete that makes the strength of the concrete maximum. Obtained results showed that marble waste fines improve the properties of sand concrete and can be used as an additive material in sand concrete formulation.",2015

This paper presents a parametric experimental study on the recycling of calcined oyster-shells ash (OS) to replace lime in the production of unfired fly ash bricks (UFB). Experiments were conducted with five different replacement levels of OS (between 0% and 20%) to study the effect on mechanical strength and freeze thaw resistance. In addition, this study investigates the effect of wet dry cycles on the shrinkage, water absorption and strength of UFB samples. According to the test results, the bricks incorporating OS and lime achieved 28-day strength and durability within grade M15 according to GB/T2542-2012 (Chinese Standard). Moreover, the wet dry cycles within the investigated limits in this study showed positive effect on mechanical properties, indicating that the bricks are usable in both wet and dry environmental conditions. The present investigation demonstrates a potential application of waste OS that can enhance the sustainable of society by reducing environmental pollution by converting hazardous waste into useful construction material.

Beyond it is a viable solution for the utilization of the large amount of lime output residues generated, having in mind that was also found nothing similar in the world literature. There were studies on the parameters of chemical and mineralogy compositions of initial components and final product, axial resistance strength, water resistance and water absorption. The LPW was characterized by a high excess of CaCO3. The medium compression resistance of the samples, cured in air conditions during 3 days is 4.0 MPa, on the 60th day arrived to 13.4 MPa and to 17.1 MPa on the 365th day. The XRD and SEM studies explain the growth of the samples resistance by the transformation of the initial mineral mixture into carbonates of calcium, carbonates of magnesium, between other carbonates, which led to the growth of amorphous and crystalline new formations. The main advantage expected from these materials is the environmental conservation they afford, represented by the use of CDD and LPW. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2015
"LOAD-DEFLECTION CHARACTERISTICS OF STEEL, POLYPROPYLENE AND HYBRID FIBER REINFORCED CONCRETE BEAMS",steel fiber; polypropylene fiber; modulus of elasticity; load deflection curve and stiffness,,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material because of its specialty of being cast into any desired shape. The main requirements of earthquake resistant structures are good ductility and energy absorption capacity. Fiber reinforced concrete possesses high flexural and tensile strength, improved ductility, and high energy absorption over the conventional concrete in sustaining dynamic loads. The aim of this paper is to compare the properties of concrete beams in which three types of fibers are added individually. Steel fibers, polypropylene fibers and hybrid fibers were added to concrete in the weight ratio of four percentages in the preparation of four beam specimens. The fourth specimen did not contain fibers and acted as a control specimen. The dimensions of the beam specimens were 150 mm x 150 mm x 700 mm. The reinforced concrete beams of M30 grade concrete were prepared for casting and testing. Various parameters such as load carrying capacity, stiffness degradation, ductility characteristics and energy absorption capacity of FRC beams were compared with that of RC beams. The companion specimens were cast and tested to study strength properties and then the results were compared. All the beams were tested under three point bending under Universal Testing Machine (UTM). The results were evaluated with respect to modulus of elasticity, first crack load, ultimate load, and ultimate deflection. The test result shows that use of hybrid fiber improves the flexural performance of the reinforced concrete beams. The flexural behavior and stiffness of the tested beams were calculated, and compared with respect to their load carrying capacities. Comparison was also made with theoretical calculations in order to determine the load-deflection curves of the tested beams. Results of the experimental programme were compared with theoretical predictions. Based on the results of the experimental programme, it can be concluded that the addition of steel, polypropylene and hybrid fibers by 4% by weight of cement (but 2.14 % by volume of cement) had the best effect on the stiffness and energy absorption capacity of the beams.",2015
Condition Assessment of Cementitious Materials Using Surface Waves in Ultrasonic Frequency Range,condition assessment; surface waves; ultrasonic testing; wavelet transform; dispersion; cementitious materials,CONCRETE,"Surface waves propagating in a medium provide information about the mechanical properties and condition of the material. Variations in the material condition can be inferred from changes in the surface wave characteristics. Multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) is a well-established surface wave method used for determination of the shear-wave profile of the soil layers near the surface. The MASW test configuration is also applicable to assess the condition of construction materials using appropriate frequency range. Previous studies on the detection of surface-breaking cracks in concrete elements, using the dispersion and attenuation of ultrasonic waves, were successful; however, a complete damage assessment of the whole element was not in the scope of these studies. In this study, different wave characteristics, such as Rayleigh wave velocity, wave attenuation, and phase velocity dispersion, are investigated to evaluate their sensitivity to the damage in a medium. The condition of a test specimen, which is a half-space medium made of cement and sand, is evaluated using ultrasonic transducers for different damage cases. The recorded signals are processed using the Fourier and wavelet transforms to determine the surface wave characteristics. A new dispersion index (DI) is introduced, which represents the global correlation between the dispersion of phase velocity and damage level. All features are found to be capable of reflecting the damage in the test medium with different levels of sensitivity. Among the investigated parameters, the proposed dispersion index shows high sensitivity and linear correlation with the damage.",2015

In this investigation, nano-TiO2 was added to AAS, and its mechanical properties and shrinkage were tested to examine its effect on hardened alkali-activated slag paste (AASP). To understand the impact of nano-TiO2 on AASP at micro scale, FTIR, MIP and SEM were carried out. Experimental results indicate that the addition of nano-TiO2 to AAS enhances the mechanical strength, and decreases the shrinkage of AASP. FTIR and SEM results demonstrated that the addition of nano-TiO2 into the AASP accelerates its hydration process, resulting in more hydration products and denser structure. MIP results showed that the addition of nano-TiO2 reduces the total porosity of AASP and changes the pore structure. The porosity of 1.25-25 nm mesopores, which is believed to be responsible for the high shrinkage of AASP, is remarkably reduced due to the addition of nano-TiO2. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Performance of High Strength Self-Compacting Concrete Beams under Different Modes of Failure,construction materials; concrete admixtures; self-consolidating concrete; high-strength concrete; reinforced concrete beams; structural behavior,BOND STRENGTH,"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is a stable and cohesive high consistency concrete mix with enhanced filling ability properties that reduce the need for mechanical compaction. Limited standards and specifications have been reported in the literature on the structural behavior of reinforced self-compacting concrete elements. The significance of the research presented in this paper stems from the need to investigate the effect of enhanced fluidity of SCC on the structural behavior of high strength self-consolidating reinforced concrete beams. To meet the objectives of this research, twelve reinforced concrete beams were prepared with two different generations of superplasticizers and designed to exhibit flexure, shear, or bond splitting failure. The compared beams were identical except for the type of superplasticizer being used (second generation sulphonated-based superplasticizer or third generation polycarboxylate-based superplasticizer). The outcomes of the experimental work revealed comparable resistance of beam specimens made with self-compacting (SCC) and conventional vibrated concrete (VC). The dissimilarities in the experimental values between the SCC and the control VC beams were not major, leading to the conclusion that the high flowability of SCC has little effect on the flexural, shear and bond strengths of concrete members.",2015

Those reports, used as building codes, are applicable when the properties and composition of the material respect various criteria. All those materials that do not meet the scope criteria of Eurocode 2 or ACI reports because of their composition, property values or application cannot be used in the design of structures with those building codes. Regarding cement-based materials, concretes and mortars whose compressive strength is lower than the minima might not be useful for structures; however, they present an interesting potential for applications such as infrastructure materials, slabs-on-ground, etc. When designing structures and infrastructures in those materials, the accuracy of any formula offered by those building codes should be checked before being used. This article compares experimental measurements and predictive formulas for the engineering properties (compressive and tensile strengths, modulus of elasticity). The results show that the addition of specific aggregates with low stiffness and strength modifies the relation between those engineering properties, thus reducing the accuracy of some of the predictive formulas suggested in ACI reports or Eurocodes.",2015

The changes introduce new coefficients for steel grade and clear spacing between bars, and extend the range of concrete strengths covered. The way in which the contribution of hooks or anchorages is calculated has been revised and the contribution of end bearing to laps and anchorages of compression bars is recognized. The revised rules represent a move away from a distinction between laps and anchorages per se towards a distinction based on the presence or absence of transverse pressure perpendicular to the bar axis within the bond length. The benefits of staggering laps with only a proportion of bars lapped at a section are also reviewed. Finally, the potential impact of lap and anchorage performance on structural robustness is discussed, and it is concluded that this can only be achieved if bar yield precedes splitting mode bond failures.",2015
Bond behaviour of normal- and high-strength recycled aggregate concrete,coarse recycled concrete aggregate; replacement level; natural coarse aggregate; bond; pullout failure; normalized bond strength; building materials; construction materials; reinforcement; testing; experiments; anchorage,DEVELOPMENT LENGTH CRITERIA; DEFORMED STEEL BARS; REINFORCING BARS; SPLICES; BEAMS; HSC,"The effect of concrete grade on the bond between 12 mm diameter deformed steel bars and recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) has been investigated with the help of 45 pullout tests with concentric rebar placement for coarse recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) replacement levels of 25, 50, 75 and 100%. For all the three concrete grades, the measured bond-slip relationships indicate similar mechanisms of bond resistance in the RAC and the natural aggregate (NA) concrete. The most accurate and least conservative predictions of the measured bond strengths were obtained from the local bond-slip model in the fib Model Code for Concrete Structures 2010. Bond strength normalized to f(c)((3/4)) resulted in an improved match with test data and increased with an increase in the RCA replacement levels and decreased with an increase in compressive strength. An attempt to explain this behaviour has been sought in terms of brittleness index, an analogous parameter from rock mechanics. An empirical bond stress versus slip relationship has been proposed for the 12 mm diameter bar and it is conservatively suggested that similar anchorage lengths for this bar in all three concrete grades can be adopted for the RAC and the NA concretes.",2015

In the case of brittle and quasi-brittle materials, such as concrete, the tensile parameters are often derived indirectly. However, for materials with more ductility, such as SFRC, there is conjecture as to whether or not an indirect measure may be used to establish the stress versus crack opening displacement relationship, such as the use of a three- or four-point prism test combined with an inverse analysis. In this paper a simple and efficient inverse analysis technique is developed and shown to compare well with data obtained from direct tension tests. Furthermore, the methodology proposed by the fib Model Code for Concrete Structures 2010 has been investigated and recommendations made to improve its accuracy.",2015
Quality assessment of material models for reinforced concrete flexural members,model evaluation; model quality; model uncertainty; parameter uncertainty; tension stiffening; building materials; construction materials; analysis and design methods; general,NONLINEAR-ANALYSIS; CODE 2010; UNCERTAINTY; QUANTIFICATION; SELECTION,"Non-linear constitutive models for concrete in compression are frequently defined in design codes. The engineer generally uses either the linear (in SLS) or non-linear (in ULS) compression model. However, a large variety of different approaches exists for describing the behaviour of the cracked concrete tension zone, and the selection of a corresponding model is usually based on qualitative engineering judgement. The aim of this paper is to assess the prediction quality of several concrete material models in order to provide a quantitative model selection. Therefore, uncertainty analysis is applied in order to investigate the model and parameter uncertainty in the bending stiffness prognosis for flexural members. The total uncertainty is converted into a prognosis model quality that allows a quantitative comparison between the material models considered. The consideration of the reinforced concrete in tension is based on the characterization of the tension stiffening effect, which describes the cracking in an average sense. In the interest of the practical applicability of the models considered, even for large structures, no discrete crack simulations based on fracture mechanics are considered. Finally, the assessment identifies that the prediction quality depends on the loading level and, furthermore, the quality across the models can be quantitatively similar as well as diverse.",2015

Naturally occurring nanoclays, such as halloysite nanotubes and kaolin nanoplates are cheap and abundantly available materials allowing encapsulating alumosilicate microcores with simple and scalable layer-by-layer (LbL) nanocoating technique. An electrostatic attraction drives coating of anionic nanoclays onto fly ash particles providing a potential to controllably adjust properties of geopolymer composites.

Accordingly, experiments were carried out to determine the viability of hybrid finishing materials for use on floors, with 3-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane as the silane coupling agent. Based on the results of adhesion strength, impact resistance, flexural strength, compressive strength, and length change tests, the optimal silica/silane mixing ratio (mass ratio) was found to be 1:1.75.",2015
Sustainable Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures through CO2 Emission Optimization,Carbon emissions; Cost optimization; CO2 footprint optimization; Greenhouse gas emissions; Reinforced concrete; Optimization; Special design issues,EMBODIED ENERGY; LIFE-CYCLE; BUILDINGS,"Efforts are being made to achieve more efficient operation of buildings, with the goal of reducing the construction industry's contribution to energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. That contribution also includes the energy embodied in structures; that is, the energy consumed in the processes of extracting, manufacturing, transporting, and installing construction materials (including recycled materials) and elements. In particular, in spite of the use of additives such as fly ash, reinforced concrete (RC) structures, which are large consumers of cement, are responsible for a sizable proportion of worldwide carbon emissions. These emissions can be reduced significantly through the more efficient use of both concrete and steel that can be achieved by optimization. Modern optimization tools are now available that make it possible to perform large volumes of calculations efficiently that are applicable to a wide variety of structural engineering problems. This study presents an optimization approach developed with a view to allowing decision makers to balance sustainability and economic objectives. To illustrate this approach, an RC frame under gravity and lateral loads is considered in this paper. It was found that, depending upon the parameter values used in the calculations, the design optimized with respect to the CO2 footprint yields a CO2 footprint that is lower (by 5% to 10%) than the design optimized with respect to cost. The reduction can be smaller for low-rise structures and other structures with predominantly tension-controlled members. However, for structures whose members predominantly experience large compressive forces, such as high-rise buildings, the reduction may be more significant. This also may be true of certain prestressed and poststressed concrete members. Additional research aimed at ascertaining the extent to which this is the case is warranted.",2015

The best approach in overcoming the aforementioned waste management problems is to promote large volume recycling/reuse of these waste materials. In recent years, the rapid growth in research and development related to geopolymer binders has indeed indicated that the use of geopolymer offers the greatest potential in solving not only the waste management problems related to the aluminosilicate solid waste materials generated from various industries, but also the environmental degradation related to the use of OPC as primary binder material in the construction industry. Results of recent studies are indicative that geopolymer concrete fabricated using various industrial by-products exhibited similar or better mechanical, physical and durability properties as compared to OPC concrete. This paper presents a concise review of the current studies on the utilization of industrial by-products as the primary binder materials in the fabrication of geopolymer concrete. The effects of a number of major factors such as the use of chemical activator, post fabrication curing regime, particle size distribution of source materials, and aggressive environment exposure on the mechanical strength, physical properties, microstructures and durability properties of the geopolymer concrete are exhaustively deliberated. Besides, the current material design, fabrication procedures and post fabrication treatment procedures were rigorously reviewed to identify the limitations of the current geopolymer technology which impede its wide implementation in the construction industry. It has been identified that the high alkaline content in the material design and requirement for elevated temperature treatment of the contemporary geopolymeric binder are among the major technical challenges which resulted in the limited use of the material in the construction industry. Based upon that, numerous strategies were proposed to overcome the current limitations of the geopolymer technology towards promoting a large scale implementation of the technology in the production of construction materials.

It is acknowledged as a useful tool to reduce water run-off and it provides environmental benefits by lowering the pavement surface temperature, noise due to traffic and pollutants. Unfortunately, high drainability properties do not comply with high resistance and durability when facing traffic conditions. Standards and rigorous specifications for construction and placement are lacking and contractors rely on experience to conduct the work. The same aggregate sieve distribution and paste content can result in different pervious concrete pavement characteristics depending on the compaction energy applied. Too much compaction will generally reduce voids while enhancing resistance and vice versa. The present study aimed at evaluating the improvements due to reinforcing fibres into pervious concrete mixtures for achieving better performance. In particular, void content, permeability, stiffness and tensile strength were evaluated according to several compaction energies and types of fibres. Results identified certain types of fibres as a potential improvement for pervious concrete mixtures increasing mechanical performance while maintaining the drainability features. The primary goal was to determine a correct balance in compaction to be provided and mechanical performance to be achieved, which would result in a proper resistance-to-drainability ratio.",2015

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which has a high ultimate tensile strain, is a relatively new type of fiber. Given the limited number of studies on PET-FRP, the goal of this study is to observe and define the mechanical behavior of PET-FRP-confined concrete specimens subjected to monotonic/cyclic compression loading. In this study, the behavior of concrete confined with PET-FRP is compared with the behavior of concrete confined with other types of FRP. The general form of the compression stress-strain relationship of PET-FRP-confined concrete consists of two parts that are connected with a transition part, which is similar to concrete confined with other FRP types. Additionally, to understand whether available models are able to predict the compressive behavior of PET-FRP-confined concrete, the predictions from four models are compared with the corresponding test results. The results indicate that the compression stress-axial strain relationship of PET-confined concrete is not predicted in a sufficient manner using the four models.

Environmental evaluation of two scenarios for the selection of materials for asphalt wearing courses,LCA; Carbon steel slag aggregate; Road construction; Asphalt wearing course; Transport sensitivity analysis; Slovenia,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; SOLID-WASTE INCINERATION; ROAD CONSTRUCTION; BOTTOM ASH; EAF SLAG; CONCRETE; LCA; AGGREGATE; SYSTEMS; ALLOCATION,"Carbon steel slag is quite commonly used in road construction to replace natural aggregate. Since it is important to evaluate such a replacement from the environmental point of view, a Life Cycle Assessment was carried out in order to compare the environmental impacts of the construction of asphalt wearing courses with the use of siliceous aggregates (the ""conventional scenario""), and the use of alternative, steel slag aggregates (the ""alternative scenario""). The main advantage of the alternative scenario is that a reduction can be achieved in the consumption of natural aggregate, as well as in the quantity of slag deposited on landfill sites. On the other hand larger amount of bitumen is needed as a binder. However, the results of the Life Cycle Assessment (based on consequential modelling) revealed that the alternative scenario is to be significantly preferred if the following impact categories are taken into account: Acidification, Eutrophication, Photochemical Ozone Creation and Human Toxicity. In the case of the discussed indicators, the impacts are reduced to a level equal to about 80% of the conventional scenario impacts. This benefit was additionally evaluated by means of a transport sensitivity analysis, which provided results which could be useful for road managers working on case studies using similar construction materials. The alternative scenario is more sustainable than the conventional scenario with regard to the discussed impact categories even when taking into account long delivery distances of the steel slag aggregate (similar to 100 km) and minimal delivery distances of the siliceous aggregate. Considering similar delivery distances in both scenarios, the alternative scenario was found to be beneficial also with regard to the Global Warming, but only when the delivery distance of the steel slag aggregates did not exceed 160 km.

With the growth in urbanization and industrialization, the demand for concrete is increasing day by-days. Therefore, raw materials and natural resources are required in large quantities for concrete production worldwide. At the same time, a considerable quantity of agricultural waste and other types of solid material disposal are posing serious environmental issues. To minimize and reduce the negative impact of the concrete industry through the explosive usage of raw materials, the use of agricultural wastes as supplementary cementitious materials, the source of which are both reliable and suitable for alternative preventive solutions promotes the environmental sustainability of the industry. This paper reviews the possible use of agricultural wastes as a supplementary cementitious material in the production of concrete. It aims to exhibit the idea of utilizing these wastes by elaborating upon their engineering, physical and chemical properties. This provides a summary of the existing knowledge about the successful use of agricultural wastes such as rice husk ash, palm oil fuel ash, sugar cane bagasse ash, wood waste ash, bamboo leaf ash, and corn cob ash in the concrete industry.

Study of Granulated Blast Furnace Slag as Fine Aggregates in Concrete for Sustainable Infrastructure,GBFS; Sustainable infrastructutre,DURABILITY; STRENGTH; GGBS,Growing environmental restrictions to the exploitation of sand from river beds leads to search for alternatives particularly near the larger metropolitan areas. This has brought in severe strains on the availability of sand forcing the construction industry to look for alternative construction materials without compromising the strength criteria of concrete. Granulated blast furnace slags are one of the promising sustainable solutions as they are obtained as solid wastes generated by industry. Hence it reduces the solid waste disposal problem and other environmental issues. Present experimental work explores the possibility of using GBFS as replacement of natural sand in concrete. In this study an attempt is done to understand the variation in compressive strength of concrete with GBFS content. Along with that cost analysis is also done to suggest the most optimized percentage of GBFS to be used in various conditions. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.,2015
"Sustainable Utilization of MSWI Bottom Ash as Road Construction Materials, Part I: Physical and Mechanical Evaluation",,FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; AGGREGATE; PASTES,"Current management practice, existing regulations, and environmental consequences of municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash utilization were comprehensively reviewed. Efforts were made to physically and mechanically characterize MSWI bottom and fly ashes and also to evaluate their influence on the structural properties of Portland cement concrete (PCC) and hot-mix asphalt (HMA) when part of fine aggregate is replaced with the MSWI bottom ash. Fundamental properties of MSWI bottom ash and fly ash were studied by conducting physical, microstructural, and chemical tests. Concrete cylinders were cast with various amounts of ash additions and their strength and durability were investigated as the replacement ratio of ash increases. The MSWI bottom ash was also used to replace fine aggregate in HMA. Varying proportions of bottom ash and fine aggregate were tried in an effort to determine the optimum ratio of bottom ash to fine aggregate, as determined by performance tests such as the Marshall Stability and Flow test and the moisture susceptibility test.",2015

In European and Asian countries, municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) ash has been beneficially utilized by separating the bottom ash from fly ash and using them as road construction materials. Generally, MSWI bottom ash, classified as nonhazardous materials, is used to replace either cement or fine aggregate in asphalt and concrete mixtures. In this study, chemical and microstructural analyses of MSWI bottom ash ('as received' samples) produced from a Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF) plant in Florida were conducted. The characterization method included energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods.

Features of materials versus thermal comfort in a passive building,thermal comfort; passive building; PMV; PPD,NIGHT VENTILATION; DESIGN,"Summer time is especially difficult to provide optimal conditions of the microclimate in heavily used areas. Choosing optimal materials and construction solutions is essential and can guarantee maintaining comfortable conditions inside the building in all seasons, even when outside temperatures reach high levels. This article focuses primarily on the effect of the heat capacity of construction materials on the thermal comfort in a passive school building. Cellular concrete, silicate blocks and solid brick were analyzed. The simulation was performed from 15th May to 15th September. Results presented in this article show that in order to protect the building from overheating, heavy materials with a high heat capacity are the most effective. In case when highly conductive materials were used, it can be observed that lower inner temperatures appear during summer and predicted mean vote values are close to the thermal comfort zone.

Air pollution as an important factor in construction materials deterioration in Slovak Republic,map of corrosion; air pollution; stone material; concrete; carbon steel; material deterioration,,"Climatic parameters and atmospheric pollution are highly relevant to the degradation of several building materials like construction metallic materials, concrete structures and plasters of buildings, bridges or art sculptures. Degradation of not only metal materials, but also other construction materials (concrete, glass, etc.) by chemical environmental loads is an increasingly serious problem not only in Slovakia, but all over the world. The atmosphere and, ultimately, the hydrosphere could be particularly polluted by industrial activity, thus causing an increased corrosion aggressiveness of atmosphere. In the article, the air pollution impact on stone materials and carbon steel in Slovak Republic is observed. In the evaluation, there are used dose-response functions, which were developed based on long-term research by the other authors. Effectively, multi-annual climatic parameters and parameters of air pollution in Slovak Republic were used for generation of the maps of annual average surface loss of stone materials and carbon steel. One of the priorities of that research is creation of corrosion maps of different materials, which do not help to protect materials, but could be useful for prediction of risks during design, analysis and maintenance. The values obtained from this interpolation of the maps would be used as a basis for a long-term research work in mapping the state of degradation of various materials in Slovak Republic.

Frequency analysis for EIS measurements in autoclaved aerated concrete constructions,non-destructive testing; electrical impedance; spectrometry; frequency analysis; humidity distribution; aerated concrete,CEMENT PASTE; IMPEDANCE,"In time of energy saving it is important to monitor humidity migration process through delimiting constructions. Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is considered to be one of the most efficient load bearing construction materials in aspect of thermo insulation. For AAC it is important to determine the distribution of humidity throughout the cross section of the construction because it influences the thermic resistance of the construction. Therefore, it is important to monitor the drying process of AAC masonry constructions. This aim can be reached by non-destructive testing methods, which are easily applicable on inhabited buildings as well as on buildings, which are in construction phase. One of such methods is electrical impedance spectrometry (EIS), which can be used for determining of humidity distribution throughout the cross section of the construction. For this non-destructive testing method, it is important to choose correct measurement frequency in order to obtain credible results of humidity distribution. In this paper, methods of choosing suitable measurement frequencies are described as well as impact of different factors on choosing of the most suitable measurement frequencies of AAC masonry constructions.

Porosity of self-compacting concrete,Durability; Porosity; Self-compacting concrete; Strength; Surface hardness,,"The construction industry demands more durable concrete with high performance. Self-compacting concrete (SCC) is developing gradually to meet many aspects of construction technology, especially reinforced concrete. On the other hand, durability properties still need some enhancements particularly in term of microstructure properties. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on non-destructive testing of self-compacting concrete. Question arises: are the contexts on the strength of conventional normal concrete (NC) extendable on the strength of SCC? Laboratory tests were carried out at the BME, Department of Construction Materials and Technologies. Aim of the research was to determine the service life of SCC with respect to normal concrete. Constant and variable parameters were determined to the concrete mixes. Constant parameters were: type of cement CEM III-A 32.5 N-MS and grading curve of the aggregate. Variable parameters were: water-cement ratio, content of cement, content of limestone powder. The purpose of this study is to analyze the implementation of economical non-pozzolanic filler additive (limestone) into the concrete matrix of SCC. Normal and Self-compacting concrete mixes were prepared to reach a correlation between porosity indicators. Results indicated that SCC mixtures had more reliable rebound index and lower total porosity values than NC; whereas water absorption in SCC was found to show considerably higher values than referred NC mixes.

Investigation of the case-based reasoning retrieval process to estimate resources in construction projects,artificial intelligence; case-based reasoning; preliminary estimates; resource estimates; retrieval process,ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; COST ESTIMATION; MODEL,"Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a methodology that is seeing increasing use to make predictions during the early phases of a project. It allows estimators to exploit existing knowledge to make predictions that are considerably better than without its use. All CBR, however, is not identical, and variations in how CBR is done can affect the accuracy of the predictions. One particular area of sensitivity is the retrieval phase, i.e. the way in which the CBR determines the closeness between the new and the existing cases. In this paper, CBR is used to make estimates of resources for construction projects, and the use of the nearest neighbor technique to identify the similarity for the retrieval phase to predict the construction material quantities (CMQs) in concrete structures is investigated. Two types of distances, i.e. 1) the City-block distance and 2) the Euclidean distance, and four different types of weights, based on regression analysis and feature counting, to account for the relative importance of the different parameters, are investigated. The four different types of weights used were 1) the adjusted unstandardized coefficients from the regression models, 2) the unadjusted unstandardized coefficients from the regression models, 3) the standardized coefficients from the regression models, and 4) equal weights (i.e., feature counting), in which the weights applied are 1/k, and k is the number of parameter being compared to determine the distance. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to evaluate each combination investigated. It was found that for a similarity threshold of 90%, the CBR methodology using the City-block distance with the adjusted unstandardized coefficients from the regression analysis models using the transformed (LN) dataset as weights, gave the best results, with a MAPE of 8.16%. The worst results were obtained from the CBR methodology using the Euclidean distance with feature counting weights, with a MAPE of 28.40%. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2015

Due to prohibitive cost of cleaning and disposing oil contaminated sand, mixing and stabilising them with cement and using them in construction is now considered as an alternative and cheap remediation method. In this paper, the effect of oil contamination on the mechanical properties of sand and its concrete were reviewed. In addition, the results of the on-going research and development on the effects of light crude oil contamination on the properties of fine sand and the produced mortar are presented. For fine sand contaminated with light crude oil, it was found that the cohesion increased significantly up to 1% of oil contamination and then decreased with increasing percentage of crude oil while a slight reduction in frictional angle was observed with oil contamination. The highest compressive strength was obtained for mortar with 1% oil contamination and with only a 18% decrease in strength of mortar with 10% oil contamination compared to the uncontaminated samples. More importantly, the compressive strength of mortar with oil contaminated sand was found suitable for some engineering applications indicating their high potential and beneficial use as an emerging and sustainable material in building and construction.

However, environmental concerns both in terms of damage caused by the extraction of raw material and carbon dioxide emission during cement manufacture have brought pressures to reduce cement consumption by the use of supplementary cementing materials (SCM). Metakaolin is a SCM, which has a significant potential for the production of High Strength Concrete (HSC) and Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC). Because of the lower processing temperature compared to cement clinker, use of metakaolin can contribute to sustainability through energy savings, as well as reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

SCC having a strength category of 80, 100, 120 MPa developed a with metakaolin replacement percentages of 7.5, 15, and 22.5 % respectively. All the SCCs developed using metakaolin exhibited good fresh properties. It has been observed that SCC with metakaolin having powder content 550 kg/m(3) is sufficient to produce 120 MPa.

Since 1st January 2014 U-value can't be higher than 0,25 [W/m(2)K], but since 2017 this value will be 0,23 and 0,20 from 2021. Therefore, a good solution to fulfill mentioned conditions is using buildings material with better thermos insulation. One of the best construction materials, which have very low lambda value [W/mK] is an autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC). It's the reason why AAC is the most popular buildings material from years. AAC could be produced with using various aggregates, like sand or fly ash. Test results of thermal conductivity clearly shown that AAC based on siliceous fly ash have better lambda value than sand AAC in the same density. Polish energy policy is based on coal and production AAC based on siliceous fly ash is a great solution to utilization this waste. Autoclaved aerated concrete has better lambda value than other available construction materials in polish market. Lower density have good impact on environment, because lower weight caused possibility to transport more products by the same truck and also it means less waste from buildings made from AAC in the future. This waste can be used again in normal production process of AAC. Due to these facts were undertaken studies of possibility of production AAC in 350 [kg/m(3)] density in PGS process technology. The PGS process technology is a very specific because in a production cement is not used. As a binder are used only: quick lime, gypsum and some part of fly ash. The most important properties of AAC were tested, like: compressive strength, density, lambda value or phase composition. Production AAC in lower density could be the next step to improve that it's an environmental friendly material for energy-efficient constructions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Geopolymers made of fused slags with an alkali activator exhibited very high compressive strength compared with those of ordinary geopolymers, and their microscopic structures were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to confirm the formation of crystallites during the geopolymerization and to explain the relationship between the microstructure and mechanical property of the geopolymers.",2015
The Grey Relational Analysis of Quality Investigation of Concrete Containing Solar PV Cells,,TAGUCHI METHOD,"The construction industry through the use of less polluting green energy technology is already imminent and more had to do, and continue to improve as the development of green energy. Concrete is the most common-used construction material in the modern world. Traditional concrete is a composite, which is made of aggregate, Portland cement and water. Production of Portland cement consumes large amount of energy and releases lots of carbon dioxide, nevertheless, the developing of sustainable society means more urgent and important to search for new cementitious materials to replace Portland cement in future constructions. The research employs Taguchi method and Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) to invetigate the performance of alkali activated silica fume concrete in which amorphous silicon solar cells are ground and added into the mixture in three-phase analysis. Firstly, this study used Taguchi's orthogonal array to evaluate the influence of the control factors and identify the important factors influencing quality characteristics. Secondly, all normalizing experiment variables ranked the grey relational grades of multi-quality characteristics. Finally, this study integrated the Taguchi method and the equal weights by using GRA to establish both equal and entropy weight-based grey relational values.",2015
Evaluation of human-induced vibration of continuous footbridges,,,"With the development of construction materials and the introduction of high strength steel and concrete, the human-induced vibration became a dominant criterion for the design of pedestrian bridges. Currently, longer spans and lightweight bridges have been comprised in most of design trends. This leads to lower the natural frequencies of the system which have a great effect on the dynamic performance of bridges subjected to human activities. Although the design of steel footbridges could reach the optimum level of design in terms of strength criterion, it might not reach the acceptance level for vibration condition. This will enforce the designer to choose section profiles with higher inertia to enhance stiffness of the whole system. This paper presents an overall assessment for floor vibration problem due to pedestrian induced vertical forces on continuous composite footbridges. The footfall method presented by concrete centre ""CCIP-016"" is adopted in this study to evaluate the response factor and acceleration of pedestrian bridges using a FEA software package ""Robot Structural Analysis"".",2015
GEOTECHNICAL ANALYSIS OF LONG-TERM STABILITY OF SAINT PETERSBURG METRO TUNNELS IN UPPER VENDIAN CLAY,geotechnical analysis; fissured clays; tunnels; seepages; biocorrosion,,"The features of geotechnical conditions of deep running tunnels in the Upper Vendian Clay Formation were analyzed. It was noted that the clay massif, surrounding the tunnels, must be considered as a fractured-and-block medium. It has a zonal structure in relation to depth, intensity of fissuring, and physical-mechanical properties of the clays. Within the limits of tectonic fault zones, the clays have a maximal degree of fracturing that determinates their relatively high permeability (up to 10(-2)-10(-3) m/day). Special attention is given to the influence of hydrodynamic conditions and chemical compound of the Vendian aquifer system on the service conditions of the existing tunnels. The results of chemical analysis of water extracts from deteriorated construction materials showed anomaly high compounds of chloride and sodium caused by the mineralized groundwater inflow from the Vendian aquifer system. Microbiological investigations have revealed a number of microorganisms' forms induced a corrosion of materials such as reinforced concrete, cast iron and bitumen. The possible protection method from the biocorrosion by using an addition of biocides into constructional or repair materials was recommended.",2015
Development of High Performance Aerogel Concrete,Aerogel; Concrete; High Performance Concrete; Ultra-high Performance Concrete; Heat Insulation; Thermal Conductivity,,"Current massive wall-building materials can be characterized by having either low thermal conductivities and thus low bulk densities and low compression strength or high compressions strength, high bulk densities and high thermal conductivities. In this paper, the first results of a research project are presented, in which a new aerogel-based construction material is developed that exhibits extra ordinary heat-insulating and load-carrying properties. By embedding silica aerogel granules in a high strength cement matrix ""High Performance Aerogel Concrete"" is developed, which combines the benefits of conventional concrete (compressive strength, unlimited moldability) with the properties of a heat insulating material. So far, various mixtures were examined in terms of their compressive strength and thermal conductivity. The first results are very promising with compressive strength between 3.0 MPa and 23.6 MPa and thermal conductivities between 0.16 W/(mK) and 0.37 W/(mK). (C) 2015 The Authors.

NANOMODIFIED CONCRETE,nana-modified concrete; nano-disperse silica; concrete density,,"One of the main directions in construction material science is the development of next generation concrete that is ultra-dense, high-strength, ultra-porous, high heat efficient, extra corrosion-resistant. Selection of such direction is caused by extreme operational impacts on the concrete, namely: continuously increasing load on the concrete and various dynamics of such loads; the necessity in operation of concrete products in a wide temperature range and their exposure to various chemical and physical effects. The next generation concrete represents high-tech concrete mixtures with additives that takes on and retain the required properties when hardening and being used under any operational conditions. A differential characteristic of the next generation concrete is its complexity that presumes usage of various mineral dispersed components, two-and three fractional fine and coarse aggregates, complex chemical additives, combinations of polymer and iron reinforcement. Design strength and performance properties level of the next generation concrete is achieved by high-quality selection of the composition, proper selection of manufacturing techniques, concrete curing, bringing the quality of concrete items to the required level of technical condition during the operational phase. However, directed formation of its structure is necessary in order to obtain high-tech concrete. Along with the traditional methods for regulation of the next generation concrete structure, modification of concrete while using silica nanoparticles is also considered as a perspective one because the concrete patterning occurs due to introduction of a binder in a mineral matrix. Due to this it is possible to obtain nano-modified materials with completely new properties. The main problem with the creation of nano-modified concrete is a uniform distribution materials in the volume of the cement matrix which is particularly important in the cases of adding a modifier in micro-quantities. An additional environment is required in order to solve this problem and the environment will form a continuous phase in the composite. This function can be performed by liquid or dispersed phase.",2015
Enhancing the performance of porous concrete by utilizing the pumice aggregate,porous concrete; mechanical properties; volcanic pumice; aggregate replacement; aggregate-cement ratio,PERVIOUS CONCRETE,"High porosity, low modulus of elasticity, and adequate strength are the main requirements of the concrete structures as an impact energy absorber. The development of porous concrete mainly focuses on increasing the porosity rather than the strength due to many advantages can be gained when having higher porosity. Consideration to the environmental problem has been a concern recently, therefore utilization of a waste material as construction materials has been spreading widely. Volcanic pumice as one of waste materials having a high porosity can possibly be utilized as an aggregate replacement material on porous concrete to improve its porosity without much reducing the strength. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effect of varying proportion of volcanic pumice as an aggregate replacement (VP/A) and proportion of aggregate to cement (A/C) with a constant water to cement ratio (WCR) to the mechanical properties of volcanic pumice porous concrete, and to those porous concrete with normal aggregate as a control. The result shows that by using volcanic pumice the porosity increases and the modulus of elasticity decreases, even though slightly decreasing in strength is also found. However, it showed a possibility of volcanic pumice porous concrete as impact energy absorber structures. This research is a preliminary study which is expected to be developed for future research related to the dynamic and impact test. In addition, ACI 318-08 developed equation (E-c = 0.043W(1.5)f'(0.5)(c)) can be used to rapidly estimate the modulus of elasticity of porous concrete, where it is necessary, due to experimental difficulties to measure it.

ENERGY SAVING POTENTIAL IN KOSOVO HOUSEHOLD SECTOR,Households; buildings stock; energy consumption; energy efficiency,,"Households with a contribution of 40 % to overall energy consumption in Kosovo, represents a very attractive sector for implementation of Energy Efficiency measures which could results in substantial energy savings. However, government in his Energy Efficiency Action Plan of Kosovo, declares this sector as one of most problematically to achieve energy efficiency improvements. This is due to very limited financial capabilities of households and missing of attractive incentives. In order to change this situation first of all one needs reliable and sufficient data on available potential for energy efficiency improvement. Apart of some general studies, currently no comprehensive study describing current situation and providing concrete recommendation for Energy Efficiency improvement in households exists. Current paper provides major results of a detailed study of energy saving potential of existing household buildings stock. Energy saving potential is assessed based on the national methodology for calculation of energy savings whereas the corresponding building stock and construction materials applied are derived based on available national statistics and other relevant studies. Further, current paper demonstrates that by implementation of simple refurbishment measures in household buildings components, substantial energy savings could be achieved",2015
THE USE OF SEWAGE SLUDGE IN CEMENT MORTAR PRODUCTION,Sewage sludge filter cake; cement mortar; mechanical properties of cement mortar; fly-ash; silica fume,CONCRETE; REUSE; ASH,"In the last decades, the recycling of waste materials has gained considerable importance due to issues related to their ecological effects and storage. This issue is particularly crucial when dealing with hazardous waste materials such as sewage sludge. Sewage sludge is a waste material discharged from sewage treatment plants. Recently, the management of sewage sludge has become more critical in crowded cities where huge amounts of sewage sludge are produced every day. In this sense, the recycling of sewage sludge is of great importance for a sustainable environment. This study investigates the re-use of sewage sludge filter cake in cement mortar as a construction material. Accordingly, in this paper the mechanical properties of filter cake added mortar samples that comprises of sand, cement, water and admixtures such as fly-ash, silica fume and lime have been investigated. Preliminary studies indicate that addition of sewage sludge causes a delay in the setting time of mortar. To improve the time of setting, two different types of lime were added to the mortar mixtures. The addition of filter cake resulted in a decrease in both compressive strength and tensile strength. As a result, fly-ash and silica fume were added to the mortar mixture. Accordingly, eight different mortar mixtures were prepared and cast into formworks with a size of 40 mm x 40 mm x 160 mm. Flow table, capillarity, flexural strength and compressive strength experiments were conducted on these samples. For each type of experiment, nine samples out of each mixture were prepared and the arithmetic mean of the test results were taken. Flexural strength and compressive strength experiments were performed at 14, 28 and 56 days of age of mortar. In order to determine the capillarity coefficient, capillarity tests were conducted on samples at 28 and 56 days of age. The results indicate that the addition of sewage sludge delays the time of setting and decreases workability. However, the addition of lime helps to minimize this adverse effect. On the other hand, although the addition of silica fume and fly-ash results in lower strength in the early stages, the compressive and flexural strength increase rapidly and consistently with time compared to the other samples. In the light of the experimental results, it is concluded that the use of sewage sludge filter cake in cement mortar is not only an efficient way to recycle a waste material but also a convenient way provided that the amount of sewage sludge and the other admixtures are adjusted in an optimum manner.",2015
The Effect of Physical Properties on Thermal Conductivity of Lightweight Aggregate,Lightweight aggregate; loose unit weight; volume of aggregate matrix; thermal conductivity,,"There are many studies about the thermal conductivity coefficient of lightweight concrete using lightweight aggregates such as perlite, pumice, vermiculite, diatomite earth and expanded clay aggregates. However, researches related to the thermal conductivity of lightweight aggregates is limited. The lightweight aggregates are the main raw materials of lightweight construction material. In addition, the usability of lightweight aggregates as core material has been investigated in recent years. Thermal conductivity of lightweight aggregates significantly affects the thermal insulation performance of such composites. The thermal conductivity coefficients of lightweight aggregates are related to many of the physical properties of aggregates such as specific gravity, porosity, particle size etc. In this study, the effects of loose unit weight, the volume of aggregate matrix, porosity and grain size on the thermal conductivity of lightweight aggregates was investigated. Limestone aggregate (normal aggregate) was also used for comparison in the study. At first, all of the aggregates were divided into 4 different grain groups (2-1 mm, 1-0.5 mm, 0.5-0.1 mm and <0.1 mm). The specific gravity, oven-dry particle density and loose unit weight values of aggregates were determined according to TS 699 and TS EN 1097-6 standards for each grain group, then the open and closed pore rates of aggregates were calculated with obtained data. Next, the aggregates were dried up until it reached a constant weight. Afterwards, the thermal conductivity coefficients at atmospheric pressure of the lightweight aggregates were measured according to the TS EN 12664 standard. By analyzing data, the thermal conductivity coefficients of lightweight aggregates were associated with their physical properties. As a result, an empirical formula was proposed in order to estimate the thermal conductivity coefficient depending on the physical properties of lightweight aggregates. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The aim is to identify methods to produce sustainable economic materials used for soil foundation and concrete structure. Several additives have been analyzed in order to develop acceptable economical construction materials. They are expected to support soil foundation and concrete materials design for sustainable development. A comparative study has been made based on the available theoretical and experimental results reported in literature. It has also been revealed that design of appropriate steel fiber optimizes shear morphology, increases applied force, minimizes deflection, improves mechanical performances and reduces time to failure of concrete beam. Also, nanotechnology supported and enhanced compressive strength of concrete has been explained.

Comparison between ANFIS and ANN for estimation of the thermal conductivity coefficients of construction materials,Construction materials; Thermal conductivity coefficients; Artificial neural networks; ANFIS; Modeling,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORK; FUZZY INFERENCE SYSTEM; DATA MINING PROCESS; ELASTIC-MODULUS; CONCRETE; PREDICTION; LOGIC; STRENGTH; MODEL,"Determination of the thermal conductivity coefficient of construction materials is very important in terms of fulfilling the condition of comfort, durability of construction materials, and the economy of country and individual. In this study, linear regression, Adaptive Neural based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models were developed to estimate the thermal conductivity coefficient values from the surface density (dry specific gravity/thickness) and unit weight of construction materials. Validations of the developed models were investigated by statistical analyses. In the predictive models, while the lowest determination coefficient (R-2) and the highest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were obtained from linear regression, the highest R-2 and lowest RMSE were obtained from the ANFIS model. Results of the ANN model, according to the results of linear regression, showed that while R-2 increased by approximately 6%, RMSE decreased by 30-39%. The results of ANFIS model revealed that while R-2 increased by approximately 12%, RMSE decreased by 59-71%. As a result, it is suggested to be, along with surface density and unit weight with ANFIS which are the most appropriate methods between the used methods, an alternative approach to estimate the value of thermal conductivity.

"THE ANALYSIS OF THE TECHNICAL FEATURES AND DRAINAGE SYSTEM FOR EXISTING FOREST ROADS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THE NEEDS OF THEIR RECONSTRUCTION - A CASE STUDY OF MU ""BELEVINE"" TRFC ZALESINA",forest road; technical features; drainage system; reconstruction of forest roads; mountainous relief area,,"Technical features of forest roads in the Republic of Croatia are presented in Technical Conditions for Economic Roads (Slick et al., 1989). Pentek et al. (2007) gave a proposal of new technical conditions in which the basic criterion of categorization of forest roads is traffic load. According to the Regulations (Anon. 2015), in Annex IV. ""Technical conditions of forest roads"", the proposal of improvements to the existing Technical Conditions for Economic Roads is accepted (Slick et al., 1989) (Table 1). The objectives of the research are: 1. Measurement and analysis of selected technical features of forest roads and comparison with the current technical conditions in the Republic of Croatia (Sikic et al., 1989; Anon, 2015), 2. Recording and analysis of ground and underground drainage elements; road facilities and assessment of construction material categories and 3) Definition of technological process for reconstruction of forest roads in order to achieve current technical conditions and optimization of drainage systems (""zero""/optimal state). In the field, in the framework of the establishment of a detailed registry of primary forest traffic infrastructure, for each of the seven forest roads in MU ""Belevine"", on each sampling plot of 20.00 m length, according to a newly developed methodology for the establishment of a detailed registry of primary forest traffic infrastructure (Papa et al. 2015), were measured/calculated the following selected technical features: pavement width, shoulder width, longitudinal alignment gradient and pavement cross fall slope (Figure 3 and 4). Forest roads ""587 B1 001"", ""587 B1 004"" and ""587 B1 006"" were, according to the criterion of Sikic et al. (1989), categorized as main forest roads, forest roads ""587 B2 002"", ""587 B2 003""and ""587 B2 007"" belong to the category of side forest roads and forest road ""587 B3 005"" is an access forest road (Figure 5). Due to the traffic characteristics on mentioned forest roads, characteristics of MU ""Belevine"" and of forest stands, it would not be justified to construct forest roads with two lanes; therefore on forest roads ""587 B1 001"", ""587 B1 004"" and ""587 B1 006"" will apply technical specifications that apply to side forest roads, and for other forest road technical characteristics that are valid for the category of access forest roads. As a minimum width of pavement for the category of side forest roads reference value will be 4.00 m, and for the category of access forest roads 3.50 m. Side forest road minimum width of shoulders is 0.75 m and for the access forest road is 0 50 m. Maximum longitudinal alignment gradient for side forest roads is 10%, and for the access forest roads 12%. The minimum permitted vertical alignment gradient for all categories of forest roads is 0.50%. The minimum value of pavement cross fall slope for side and access macadam forest roads amounts to 3%, and the maximum permitted value of 6%. For each component of the primary forest traffic infrastructure in MU ""Belevine"", by measuring surfaces, the spatial distribution and the current state of elements of the ground and underground drainage: drainage ditch, culverts, bridges, cross ditches and fords was recorded. The position of all road facilities and other elements of forest roads were recorded. For each sampling plot, according to the schematic representation in Figure 2, the basic components of four transverse sections at a distance of 5.00 m were recorded. The cross-sections were evaluated according to material categories. In assessing the current state of the elements of ground and underground drainage, road facilities and other elements of forest roads, used methodology developed within the whole methodology of a detailed registry of primary forest traffic infrastructure is shown in Table 2 (Papa et al. 2015). Studies have been conducted on the components of the primary forest traffic infrastructure in MU ""Belevine"" within the Training and Research Forest Centre Zalesina, Faculty of Forestry, University of Zagreb. Seven macadam forest roads, of the total length 7.031 kilometers, were built in the period from 1968 to 1988. From construction to the present day, all the forest roads were regularly maintained, and maintenance was predominantly focused on repairing damages of road construction and drainage facilities. Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9 are show the analysis of variance of measured and reference (prescribed) values for each selected technical features of forest roads. For two longest forest roads in MU ""Belevine"", ""587 B1 001"" length 2207.48 m and ""587 B1 004"" length 2046.62 m, a comparison of selected current technical features to prescribed values of the same features of the Republic of Croatia (Anon, 2015) for each sampling plot (Figure 10 and 11) was done. All the selected technical features of forest roads in MU ""Belevine"", to a lesser or greater extent, deviate from the prescribed/reference values. It is interesting to note that all forest roads categorized as side and access (with the necessary technical features of the side forest roads) have a higher mean value of the pavement width than those categorized as main roads (with the necessary technical features of the access forest roads). This is explained by the dynamics of the primary forest opening of the study area. The forest road ""587 B1 001"" and ""587 B1 004"" are the first forest roads built in MU ""Belevine"", in time of less developed construction technology, different technical characteristics of forest transport vehicles and during the validity of different technical requirements for forest roads. The smallest permitted vertical alignment gradient is not a problem at any of the sampling plots of the researched forest roads. The maximum longitudinal gradients were recorded only on shorter sections of forest roads and values were slightly higher than allowed, or in the framework of exceptional justified cases which in the technical documentation must be explained in detail (in hilly/mountainous area for side forest roads up to 12%, and for access forest roads up to 15%). The reported values for pavement cross-slope values were unsatisfactory on most of the sampling plots. Reconstruction of pavement cross fall slope should lead to optimal state (between 3 and 6% for the access and side forest macadam roads). The spatial distribution and the existing state of the ground and underground drainage system elements on sampling plots of primary forest traffic infrastructure is shown in Figure 12. Table 3 shows first at the level of individual forest road and then at the level of entire management unit integrated information about ground and underground drainage system elements. There is no forest road on which intervention in the objects of ground and underground drainage system elements (in terms of enabling them to be fully functional) is unnecessary. For the ground drainage system to be optimized, the total of 3520 m classic and 1680 m lined drainage ditches on seven forest roads in MU ""Belevine"" should be constructed, as well 860 m classic drainage ditches, of which 240 m translated into lined drainage ditches should be repaired. It is necessary to construct 47 new and repair 41 existing cross-ditches. 45 concrete pipe culverts were recorded. With regard to the developed hydrograph conditions close to forest roads, existing climatic and geological features of soil in MU ""Belevine"", and with the aim of diminishing/reduce the negative impact of water on forest roads, pipe-culverts, drainage ditches and cross-ditches of the right shape, size, and type should be constructed. The elements of an optimized system of ground and underground drainage, along forest roads as well as and for the entire MU ""Belevine"" are given in Table 5. Damaged road construction and the proposed method of repairing macadam pavement structure at the level of individual forest roads and for the entire MU ""Belevine"", are shown in Table 6. Macadam pavement structure of forest roads is in good condition and does not require any intervention on 4.01% of sampling plots. At 23.98% of sampling plots, pavement can be repaired with mending method. Most of sampling plots (51.40%) show that repair pavement method should be aligning, and for 20.62% of sampling plots the most expensive method of pavement repair material outspreading is necessary. In future studies it is recommended that to the technological process of reconstruction of forest road network in MU ""Belevine"", and it is bringing to so-called ""zero""/optimized state, analysis of associated costs should be included.",2015
Genetically-enriched microbe-facilitated self-healing concrete - a sustainable material for a new generation of construction technology,,CARBONATE PRECIPITATION; DURABILITY; BACTERIA; STRAIN,"The fundamentals of engineering and structural properties such as mechanical strength, durability, bond strength, and self-healing behaviour of a genetically-enriched microbe-incorporated construction material have been explored in the present study. The alkaliphilic Bacillus subtilis bacterium is able to survive inside the concrete/mortar matrices for an extended period due to its spore forming ability. The bioremediase-like gene of a thermophilic anaerobic bacterium BKH2 (GenBank accession no. KP231522) was thus transferred to the bacillus strain to develop a true self-healing biological agent. Incorporation of the transformed bacterial cells at different concentrations in the bio-concrete/mortar exhibited higher mechanical strengths and improved durability of the samples in comparison to the normal cement-sand mortar/concretes. Microstructural analyses confirmed the formation of a novel gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7) phase besides calcite deposition inside the matrices of the transformed Bacillus subtilis-amended cementitious materials. The gradual development of nano rod-shaped gehlenite composite within the bio-mortar matrices was due to the biochemical activity of the bioremediase-like protein expressed within the incorporated bacterial cells. This development significantly increased the true self-healing property as well as enhanced the mechanical strength of the bio-concrete/mortar material which was sustained for a prolonged period. This study demonstrates a new approach towards the enhancement of structural properties and true self-healing activity by genetically-enriched spore-forming Bacillus sp. with advancement towards sustainable and green construction technology.",2015

Two binary (M1, M2) and one ternary (M3) mixtures, based on alumina powder, fluidized bed coal combustion fly- and/or bottom-ash were submitted to hydrothermal treatments in order to generate aerated building elements based on ettringite (6CaO center dot Al2O3 center dot 3SO(3)center dot 32H(2)O); ettringite is a compound characterized by low density, water insolubility, high fire resistance and significant mechanical strength. The M1 - M3 systems were hydrated in a thermostatic bath (100 % R.H) at 55 degrees C and 70 degrees C for aging periods ranging from 2 h to 28 d; the hydrated samples were submitted to both differential thermal-thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analyses for assessing the formation of the hydration products. In this regard, the ettringite generation, being also dependent on the operating temperatures and times, was observed within all the investigated systems. Furthermore, the best results in terms of both ettringite concentration and formation rate were exhibited by the M2 system at 70 degrees C after 2 d of curing.",2015
Concrete Deflection Measurement Using Fiber Optic Distributed Strain System,Brillouin scattering; concrete; deflection; distributed strain system,,"The monitoring of building structures deformations and testing of construction materials resilience are very important processes in the development and production of given materials and structures. Undesirable or excessive deformations of materials are phenomena which are unacceptable in construction, especially in supporting structures. These issues are currently monitored by electromechanical sensor in most cases. It is a classic technique when the sensor measures the material stress at the point of its installation. This paper deals with the concrete deflection measurement using fiber optic distributed strain system. This system uses optical fiere as a sensor and operates at the principle of measurement of Brillouin frequencies. The mechanical stress on the optical fiber causes shift of these frequencies. This change is subsequently converted to stress unit micro-strain. In our experiments, the optical fiber was embedded in concrete along its whole length. The advantage of this system is that the measurement is carrying out along the entire fiber length with spatial resolution around 50 cm, so it is possible continuously measure several thousands of points at the distance of several kilometers.",2015
Impact of External Heat Insulation on Drying Process of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Masonry Constructions,,ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY,"In the time when sustainable construction as well as cost saving on heating and cooling of buildings is one of the most important construction trends, it is important to acknowledge the possibilities of application of construction materials with high heat insulation parameters and the ways in which these parameters can be obtained. Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a load bearing construction material, which has high heat insulation parameters, although it has one significant disadvantage. If the AAC masonry construction has high moisture content, it loses its heat insulation properties. This is the reason why it is important to detect the humidity distribution throughout the cross section of the masonry elements in order to conduct the drying process of the AAC construction. Therefore, the question about non-destructive detection of humidity distribution throughout the cross section of the material arises. Humidity distribution throughout the cross section of AAC masonry constructions has a significant impact on its heat resistivity properties. Application of electrical impedance spectrometry (EIS) method for determination of humidity distribution throughout the cross section of AAC constructions has been a subject of research recently. The EIS method is an easily applicable non-destructive testing method for detection of the humidity distribution throughout the cross section of a construction. Research on the impact of the external heat insulation layer on the speed of humidity distribution changes is described in this paper.",2015
"Hemp Thermal Insulation Concrete with Alternative Binders, Analysis of their Thermal and Mechanical Properties",,LIME; CEMENT; BEHAVIOR; WALL; FORMULATION; DURABILITY; PARTICLES; COMPOSITE; BLENDS; IMPACT,"One of the main challenges that construction industry faces today is how to address the demands for more sustainable, environmentally friendly and carbon neutral construction materials and building upkeep processes. One of the answers to these demands is lime-hemp concrete (LHC) building materials - carbon negative materials that have sufficient thermal insulation capabilities to be used as thermal insulation materials for new as well as for existing buildings. But one problem needs to be overcome before these materials can be used on a large scale - current manufacturing technology allows these materials to be used only as self-bearing thermal insulation material with large labour intensity in the manufacturing process. In order to lower the labour intensity and allow the material to be used in wider applications, a LHC block and board production is necessary, which in turn calls for the binders different from the classically used ones, as they show insufficient mechanical strength for this new use. The particular study focuses on alternative binders produced using gypsum-cement compositions ensuring they are usable in outdoor applications together with hemp shives. Physical, mechanical, thermal and water absorption properties of hemp concrete with various binders are addressed in the current study.",2015
An Experiment on Bond Behaviors of Reinforcements Embedded in Ultra-high Performance Concrete,,,"Ultra-high Performance Concrete (UHPC) is an advanced construction material that has very high compressive strength and excellent tensile properties compared with traditional normal concrete. The application of UHPC to reinforced and/or prestressed concrete members requires an understanding of composite behavior, i.e. bond behavior, between concrete and reinforcements. This paper aims to investigate the bond behaviors of reinforcements embedded in UHPC through an experimental approach. The pull-out tests recommended in EuroCode were performed for 72 specimens with variables of diameters of reinforcements, ratios of cover depth to reinforcement diameters (Cmin/db), bonded lengths and yield strength of steels. The experimental results reveal that the bond strengths increase as the diameter of reinforcements increase and the cmin/db ratio and yield strength of steel may not give significant influences on bond strength, which are similar to the bond behavior in normal concrete. Also, the bonding capacity of UHPC is much better than that of normal concrete and the development length can be reduced in UHPC members.",2015

Improving construction material and equipment logistics via simulation,Discrete event; logistics; productivity; simulation; variables,,"The present project demonstrates a way to improve construction processes, with improvement understood in terms of increased productivity. To achieve this objective, the research presented here relies on discrete event simulation models to analyze transportation logistics, as well as distribution and storage of structure-and foundation-related materials for two reinforced-concrete buildings in Bogota, Colombia. Analysis of the case study can be divided into three phases. In the first, construction processes were characterized, and a field study was conducted via data collection and video/photo recordings. In the second, simulation models were created for the real scenario, with deficiencies and opportunities for model improvement diagnosed and different theoretical scenarios proposed. In the third and final phase, these theoretical scenarios were compared using models to determine their strengths or weaknesses versus the real construction scenario. Based on the comparative study carried out, discrete event simulation allowed for the integration and behavioral observation of all variables affecting the construction process. As a result, deficiencies became conspicuous; in turn, improvements were readily identified in order to establish the best scenario from a cost-benefit perspective.",2015
FUTURE OF CIVIL ENGINEERING MATERIALS: A REVIEW FROM RECENT DEVELOPMENTS,,CHEMICAL-PROCESSING OPPORTUNITIES; MICROFIBROUS COMPOSITES; CONCRETE; CONSTRUCTION; PERMEABILITY; BACTERIA; SURFACES,"The aim of this research paper is to address the futuristic construction materials. Relevant data of the developments made during the recent past are also presented. It is believed that nanotechnology is going to play an important role in the development of futuristic building materials. The innovations could be two-fold; one is the modification of classical materials and the other should cover the invention of novel materials. The primary goal of all such materials should be environment friendliness. Secondarily, they should be durable and cost effective. Thirdly, they should address the space shortage. Innovations are needed as man is also planning to colonize moon and other planets. Fourthly, they should have adequate strength to cater the natural and manmade calamities. In short, they should serve the coming generations in the best possible way, which is the sole purpose of an engineering discipline.",2015
Risk Assessment of Swedish Concrete as a Construction Material in Relation to Naturally Occurring Radiation from Different Aggregates,Building materials; Ionizing radiation; Activity index; Gamma radiation; Concrete,,"The European Commission (EC) has, since 1996, prescribed regulations concerning ionizing radiation from building materials. The current threshold value suggested for free circulation of building materials without restrictions are 1 mSv/year (EC 2013). By use of full scale concrete slabs of dimensions 1.5 m x 1.5 m x 0.15 m, an empirical approach is suggested for the calculation of Activity Index (I-index) of naturally occurring ionizing radioactivity from building materials. The concrete slabs simulate a pre-cast concrete wall. Measurements of K-40, Ra-226 and Th-232 are performed in order to assess the I-index, equivalent dose (AEDE), equivalent dose rate (AEDR) and some common international indices. The results indicate that similar to 70 % of the investigated building materials are in agreement with the stipulated levels set out by UNSCEAR (2000) for outdoor conditions. In relation to the I-index, 6 out of the 10 concrete slabs satisfactorily met the safety criterion (Activity Index < 1). Some aggregates fail to comply with the stipulated threshold value (EC 2013). The cause is not only a significant uranium source (Ra-226), but more frequently an increased level of Th-232 in some of the investigated concrete mixes. By and large, most indices are comparable and give a similar indication of a construction/building materials risk to produce naturally ionizing radiation to habitants. The study further suggests that an empirical approach by use of a field gamma spectrometer results in a good linear correlation with results achieved from laboratory gamma ray spectrometry analysis and consequently the empirical approach could as such be used to approximately calculate the I-index.",2015
Usability of Pyroclastic Rocks as Construction Materials; Example from Nigeria,Geotechnical performance; Mineralogy; Petrographic analysis; Pyroclastic rocks; Texture,,"Geotechnical properties of pyroclastic rocks from Nigeria have been assessed to determine their usability as construction materials. Modal analysis on the rock samples shows fine-grained to porphyritic textures. Petrographic analysis indicates high amount of plagioclase, pyroxene and groundmass, which consists of chlorite and glassy material. Comparison with construction standards indicates that the pyroclastic rocks would yield aggregates that are marginally suitable for use as road aggregates, as the tested samples fail a number of requirements as road aggregates; their Los Angeles abrasion and flakiness index values are quite outside the recommended limits. The rocks would also perform marginally as concrete aggregate, due to the poor flakiness index results. These situations may further diminish to poor as high amount of weak and deleterious minerals (especially chlorite and glassy material) are recorded in the samples, and would cause material deterioration over engineering time. Study suggests caution when the Abakaliki pyroclastic rocks are used in most engineering projects, as it is obvious that fine-grained texture and volcanic origin, although influenced their properties, but do not guarantee their good performance as construction materials.",2015
Waste Sands as a Valuable Aggregates to Produce Fibre-composites,ecology; waste sands; fiber composite; steel fibers; properties,CONCRETE; BEAMS,"In the paper an issue of waste sand utilization was raised. The heaps of waste sand located in Polish region Pomerania are by-product obtained during the process called hydroclassification of all-in-aggregate for concrete production. One of examples how to resolve the waste sand utilization problem could be its application for the production of steel fiber reinforced mineral composites. The authors introduced their tests results physical-mechanical properties of fibrous composites made on the basis of waste sands with different amounts of steel fibers. Steel fiber content is from 0 to 2.5% relative to the volume of the composite. The fibers in the mixture were arranged at random. Based on these results proposed composite of the best properties, which meets the requirements for construction materials. It was specified the exact composition of the material of this composite. For the selected composite steel fibre content of 1.2% of tests taken basic properties: compressive strength, tensile strength, residual strength, modulus of elasticity, shear strength, resistance to frost, resistance to abrasion. Tests were performed on samples having a side of 150 cubic mm and cylindrical with the dimensions 150x300 mm. Carried out research, literature studies and analysis of the obtained results allow to conclude that this material can be used for the performance of structural elements and thus creates a perspective on the use of waste aggregates. In view of the above, the large resources of small aggregates present in the form of waste could become a wealth for the region of Pomerania. Sands waste could become a basic component of materials intended for the manufacture of certain structural elements. The use of waste to produce aggregate composites constructional on a wider scale, and partial replacement of concrete simple-it such material can significantly reduce further degradation of the environment.",2015
Consumption Estimating Model of the Frame Shear Wall Structure Materials,Material consumption; Frame shear wall structure; Regression analysis; Tall building,,"The cost of raw materials accounts for about 60 % of the engineering cost in engineering projects. Reducing the consumption of construction materials is the key to control the project cost. The paper based on multivariate statistical method, through the investigation, collected a large number of building the indicators of the construction materials to establish three main building materials of the concrete frame shear wall structure, which is steel, concrete and block. Measuring building material consumption has a certain value, which can estimate the structure of the construction cost, it is also conducive to each stage of cost control in the construction.",2015
Guidelines for assessing the valorization of a waste into cementitious material: dredged sediment for production of self compacting concrete,Protocol; Waste treatment; Cementitious material; Dredged sediment; Self-compacting concrete,CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; INDUSTRIAL-WASTES; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; REMEDIATION; FILLER; ASH; MANAGEMENT; AGGREGATE; RESIDUES; QUALITY,"This article presents some guidelines in order to analyse the feasibility of including a waste material in the production of a structural cementitious material. First of all, the compatibility of the waste with a cementitious material has to be assured; then, if necessary, a decontamination step will be carried out; after, decision on the type of material has to be taken based on different aspects, with special emphasis on the granulometry. As a last step, mechanical, environmental and durability properties have to be evaluated. Then the procedure is illustrated with a full example, obtaining a self compacting concrete (SCC) including dredged sediment taken from a Spanish harbour.",2015
"Rethinking Rural Road Infrastructure Delivery Case Study of a Green, Inclusive, and Cost-Effective Road Program in Nicaragua",,,"This paper presents a development case study on alternative thinking in rural road infrastructure delivery. The delivery advances the agendas of green growth, social inclusion, and cost-effectiveness. The empirical evidence presented in this case study focuses on 6 years of engagement in a specific road program the Fourth Roads Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project financed by the government of Nicaragua and the World Bank. ""Green,"" in this case, refers to the use of road construction materials that are clean, durable, and friendly to the environment. The use of adoquines, also known as concrete cobblestones or pavers, has proved to be an economic and environmentally friendly paving alternative at the secondary and tertiary classification levels. ""Inclusion"" refers to the empowerment of all citizens to participate in and benefit from the development process and the removal of barriers against those who are often excluded. The community development approach presented in this paper is implemented by specially formed community development modules or modulos comunitarios de ado quinados (MCAs). The benefits of the MCAs include the provision of short-term employment opportunities, the building of technical and entrepreneurial skills, and the engendering of a sense of ownership in and responsibility for the roads. This paper presents the MCA model, as applied on a large scale and in a cost-effective way without compromising quality or the speed of completion. The model is presented as a best practice that could be emulated in similar development work. More importantly, the authors aim to encourage a debate and challenge the ""business as usual"" approach to the choice of surfacing and the modality of delivery of rural road infrastructure.",2015
Improving Concrete Durability for Sewerage Applications,,BIOGENIC SULFURIC-ACID; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; CORROSION; DETERIORATION; ATTACK,"Concrete is a widely adopted construction material in sewerage applications such as concrete pipes, manholes, box culverts, treatment tanks, and sewage conveyance tunnels. However, the contaminants in sewage may cause physical and chemical attacks to the concrete. In particular, the biogenic sulphuric acid attack poses a great threat to the concrete. This would shorten the service life of concrete and necessitate more frequent repairs and rehabilitations, thereby increasing the life-cycle cost of the sewerage infrastructure. As the prime solution to this problem, the authors advocate the development of sewerage concrete by improving the durability of concrete against sewerage attack. This chapter addresses the possible ways to improve the durability of concrete against sewerage attack, including the use of protective coatings, better concrete mix design (or more specifically mix design to improve the biogenic sulphuric acid resistance of concrete), and use of corrosion inhibitors.",2015
Forward and Inverse Dielectric Modeling of Oven-Dried Cement Paste Specimens in the Frequency Range of 1.02 GHz to 4.50 GHz,Dielectric dispersion; microwave frequency; water-to-cement ratio; inverse modeling,IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; ABSORPTION; CONCRETE; GPR,"The use of radar non-destructive evaluation (NDE) technique for condition assessment of deteriorated civil infrastructure systems is an effective approach for preserving the sustainability of these systems. Radar NDE utilizes the interaction between radar signals (electromagnetic waves) and construction materials for surface and subsurface sensing based on dielectric properties and geometry. In the success of radar inspection, it is imperative to develop models capable of predicting the dielectric properties of the materials under investigation. The dielectric properties (dielectric constant and loss factor) of oven-dried cement paste specimens with waterto-cement (w/c) ratios (0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55) in the frequency range of 1.02 GHz to 4.50 GHz were studied and modeled using modified Debye's models. An open-ended coaxial probe and a network analyzer were used to measure dielectric properties. Forward models are proposed and inversed for predicting the w/c ratio of a given oven-dried cement paste specimen. Modeling results agreed with the experimental data. The proposed models can be used for predicting the dielectric properties of oven-dried cement paste specimens. Also, the modeling approach can be applied to other cementitious materials (e.g., concrete) with additional modification.",2015
The use of the chrysotile cement waste as the secondary aggregate for the concrete,,,"The article presents the results of research on the effective concrete with secondary chrysotile cement aggregate. One of the important problems of modern science of construction materials is the use of secondary resources for the production of construction materials, and a considerable part of them are the chrysotile cement waste and scrapped chrysotile cement products. The aim of presented research is the development of effective concrete for the production of foundation wall blocks with the use of crushed chrysotile cement products as a secondary aggregate. The main characteristics of the secondary chrysotile cement aggregate have been determined. The concrete with different compositions and with different content of secondary chrysotile cement rubble has been studied. The dependences of the strength and the specific strength of concrete with a constant W/C ratio and constant binder consumption on the consumption of the secondary aggregate have been obtained. It is stated that the introduction of secondary chrysotile cement aggregate does not significantly effect the water resistance and frost resistance of the concrete. It is shown that the variation of the fractions of secondary aggregates and the binder makes it possible to obtain the effective concrete with a wide range of strength values.",2015
Sensitivity Analysis of Temperature Control Parameters and Study of the Simultaneous Cooling Zone during Dam Construction in High-Altitude Regions,,CONCRETE; MODEL,"There are unprecedented difficulties in building concrete gravity dams in the high altitude province Tibet with problems induced by lack of experience and technologies and unique weather conditions, as well as the adoption of construction materials that are disadvantageous to temperature control and crack prevention. Based on the understandings of the mentioned problems and leveraging the need of building gravity dam in Tibet, 3D finite element method is used to study the temperature control and crack prevention of the dam during construction. The calculation under recommend temperature control measures and standards shows that the height and number of simultaneous cooling zone have the more obvious influencers on concrete stress; therefore, it is suggested to increase the height of simultaneous cooling zone to decrease the stress caused by temperature gradient of adjoin layers so as to raise the safety level of the whole project. The research methods and ideas used on this project have significant values and can be taken as references in similar projects in high altitude regions.",2015
Exergy analysis of construction material manufacturing processes and assessment of their improvement potentials,exergy efficiency; industrial ecology; theoretical minimum exergy; improvement potential; process optimisation; efficient resource utilisation; construction materials,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; INDUSTRIAL-PROCESSES; ENERGY; STEEL; TECHNOLOGIES; EFFICIENCY; RESOURCES; COPPER; SECTOR; IRON,"This study presents the application of exergy analysis in assessing how effectively resources are utilised in construction material manufacturing. The role of exergy is discussed from several key perspectives such as quality, energy conservation and process improvement potentials. Both primary and secondary processes (recycling) of nine major non-renewable construction materials (steel, aluminium, copper, cement, concrete, ceramic, glass, polypropylene and polyvinylchloride (PVC)) have been evaluated in this study. The outlined theoretical exergy efficiency approach assesses the improvement potentials of the present manufacturing processes. The large difference between theoretical and industrial exergy demand suggests that exergy resources are utilised very inefficiently in current technologies. The study reveals that more than 55% of exergy is being lost in current technologies even though a significant amount of waste heat is recovered in different segments of the case study processes. Thus, attention is required to reduce the specific exergy losses through improved process design and introduction of new technology.",2015
Failure behavior of unbonded bi-directional prestressed concrete panels under RABT fire loading,Prestressed concrete (PSC); Bi-directional unbonded prestressing; RABT fire scenario; Spalling; Fire-resistance; Residual structural capacity,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; RESISTANCE; PERFORMANCE; COLUMNS; DAMAGE; SLABS,"Although the number of terror-and explosion-related incidents associated with military and terrorist activities is increasing globally, the existing design procedure for civil infrastructures does not consider a protective design for extreme loading scenarios such as blast, impact, and fire loading. Major infrastructure, for example bridges, tunnels, prestressed concrete containment vessels (PCCVs), and liquefied natural gas (LNG) storage tanks are often constructed using prestressed concrete, because it enhances the structural capacity. Concrete is often used as a construction material because of its low thermal conductivity, which makes it a good fire resistant material. However, the fire-resistant behavior of the highstrength concrete (HSC) and prestressing (PS) tendons used in prestressed concrete (PSC) is different than that of ordinary reinforced concrete (RC). Also, there has been limited research comparing PSC to RC under extreme loading conditions. This study presents experimental testing of unbonded bi-directionally prestressed concrete panels with dimensions 1000 x 1400 x 300 mm(3) that were tested under RABT fire loading to simulate a jet aircraft crash-fire accident. A prestressing force of 430 kN was applied to the PSC specimens using unbonded threaded bars. After a RABT fire test, residual flexural strength tests were performed on the fire-damaged PSC and on RC specimens for comparison. Results of the RABT fire and residual flexural strength tests indicated that the fire-damaged PSC specimens showed severe thermal spalling damage induced by PS relaxation and deterioration of strength/stiffness, respectively. These study results can be used as basic research data for future research in numerical simulation of fire and the design of PSC structures under the fire scenario. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Application of visible and near infrared spectroscopy in non-destructive evaluation of cement materials,,SPECTROMETRY; MINERALS; IR,"In the twenty-first century, there has been rapid urbanization in economically emerging countries. Many scientific research studies have proposed methods to monitor the quality of materials used in engineering works. Quality inspections are most often made of structure-related materials such as concrete. All the concrete used in construction work is subjected to a test that breaks the samples to evaluate its final mechanical strength. In this sense, remote sensing can contribute to mapping and monitoring construction materials, allowing investigation and identification of various properties such as mechanical strength and water content in a non-destructive manner. The materials can be inspected directly on site, in a rapid, non-invasive, and inexpensive manner; this is crucial for the ongoing process of construction. The spectral behaviour of four different mechanical strengths of two cement materials based on Portland cement, cement paste, and mortar was observed using a FieldSpec (R) 3 spectroradiometer. The spectral curves generated by recording the reflected and absorbed electromagnetic radiation of the samples were interpreted based on the theory of vibrational and electronic spectroscopy. The objective of this work is to show a novel technique for assisting in the analysis of solid samples using visible and near infrared spectroscopy. Through this study, a spectral contrast between different samples of the paste and mortar was found. Besides, it was possible to detect the presence and the corresponding proportion of water in the samples. Wavelet analysis enabled records of statistical evidence of spectral contrast, and showed that the depth of water absorption features is inversely proportional to compressive strength in the cement materials under study. This work is innovative, because there are no studies in the literature on the application of this technique as an aid tool for differentiating compressive strengths of Portland-cement-based materials.",2015
Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion Fly Ash-Activated Slag Concrete as Novel Construction Material,CFBC fly ash; drying shrinkage; hydration product; modulus of elasticity; slag; ultrasonic pulse velocity,SELF-CONSOLIDATING CONCRETE; CEMENTITIOUS PROPERTIES; HYDRATION; STRENGTH; COAL,"The performance of a novel concrete made with an eco-binder, referred to as SCA binder, that only contains raw slag (S) and raw circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) fly ash (CA) without ordinary portland cement was evaluated. The major hydration products of SCA binders are ettringite, C-S-H, and C-A-S-H, which lead to SCA pastes with proper setting times, dense microstructures, and high compressive strengths up to approximately 80 MPa (11,600 psi). The SCA concrete, which is suitable for practical applications, has compressive and tensile strengths at 91 days of approximately 50 MPa (7250 psi) and nearly 5 MPa (725 psi), respectively. In addition, the SCA concrete shows moderate expansion at early ages and a low rate of shrinkage after 91 days of exposure. The regression equations that relate the splitting tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, and ultrasonic pulse velocity to, the compressive strength are presented with a satisfactory coefficient of determination.",2015
Development and performance evaluation of a new thermal insulation material from rice straw using high frequency hot-pressing,Thermal insulation; Rice straw; High frequency hot-pressing,MOISTURE-CONTENT; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; WHEAT-STRAW; WOOD; COMPOSITE; CONDUCTIVITY; FIBERS; PARTICLEBOARDS; CONCRETE; WASTE,"A new thermal insulation material made from rice straw (RSTIB) was developed using high frequency hot pressing. The goal of this study is to investigate the effect of high frequency heating, board density, particle size and ambient temperature on the properties of RSTIB. The results indicated that the optimum physical and mechanical properties of boards are obtained with a particle moisture content (MC) of 14%, a board density of 250 kg/m(3), and an L-type particle size. Additionally, the thermal insulation boards had fairly low thermal conductivity, ranging from 0.051 to 0.053 W/(mK). Comparison with conventional hot pressing confirmed that the pressing duration can be greatly shortened by high frequency hot pressing. The boards subjected to high frequency pressing had higher internal bonding strength (IB) values than the boards subjected to conventional hot pressing. As an environmentally friendly and renewable material, RSTIB is of interest for energy saving purposes when it is used as building insulation material for walls or ceilings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Boroaluminosilicate geopolymers: role of NaOH concentration and curing temperature,,FLY-ASH GEOPOLYMER; ACCELERATED CARBONATION; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; CEMENT COMPOSITES; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; MICROSTRUCTURE; BENEFICIATION; CERAMICS; BEHAVIOR,"In the present paper, effects of concentration of sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) and curing temperature on properties of boroaluminosilicate fly ash-based geopolymers are studied. Geopolymers, cement-free eco-friendly construction materials, are formed by alkali activation of an aluminosilicate source. By changing the alkali activator from a silica-rich to boron-rich one, it may be possible to have boroaluminosilicate binders. Results obtained indicated formation of B-O bonds in these types of geopolymers. Increasing NaOH concentration was observed to reduce compressive strength due to changes occurring in the nature of reactions between the alkali activator and fly ash particles. Establishment of unwanted complex compounds as well as formation of non-stoichiometric aluminosilicate binders instead of boroaluminosilicate ones were supposed to be the main reasons for this strength reduction. Additionally, curing temperature had a strong effect on the formation of new phases. Various microstructures were observed in boroaluminosilicate binders, where the presence of needle-like crystals was the main difference between these types of geopolymers and the aluminosilicate one.",2015
EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE LOSS OF BOND BETWEEN REBARS AND CONCRETE EXPOSED TO HIGH TEMPERATURES,concrete; high strength concrete; materials characterization; high temperatures; steel-concrete bonding; fibre reinforced concrete,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; SILICA FUME; FIRE; BEHAVIOR; STEEL; TUNNEL,"Within the context of the most usual construction materials for building and civil infrastructures, concrete stands out because of its excellent behaviour when exposed to high temperatures and fire condition. The present study focuses on the residual bond strength between concrete and steel rebars after exposure to elevated temperatures and natural cooling to room temperature. Normal strength and high strength concretes have been tested, as well as polypropylene and steel fibre reinforced concretes. The bond strength has been measured using the pull-out test. Compressive and tensile strength have also been determined. Some specimens have been tested at an age of 28 days and at room temperature. At 60 days the tests have been repeated at room temperature and after heating up to three temperature ranges: 450 degrees C, 650 degrees C and 825 degrees C. Before each of the three heating phases, the specimens were pre-heated during 3 hours at 120 degrees C. After these experiments it has been possible to assess the loss of steel-concrete bonding for higher temperatures. The addition of fibres has no clear influence on the bonding at ambient condition. However, an improvement on the residual bonding strength has been observed for steel fibre reinforced concrete under high temperatures.",2015
"Novel Utilization of Fly Ash for High-Temperature Mortars: Phase Composition, Microstructure and Performances Correlation",,SELF-COMPACTING-CONCRETE; MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; PORTLAND-CEMENT; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT; POZZOLANIC REACTION; FIRE RESISTANCE; PART 1,"In this study, the feasibility of using fly ash to manufacture high-temperature mortars was investigated. The investigation was set to define preliminary characteristics of new types of mortars based on ordinary and/or refractory cement with fly ash addition, and to establish mutual correlation between thermally induced changes of mineral phases, microstructure, and final performances of the mortars. New mortars, made up of 21% cement (PC-CEM I 42.5R/HAC-Secar 70/71), 70% river sand, and 9% fly ash, were chemically, physically, and mechanically characterized to determine possibilities of fly ash re-utilization for high-temperature purposes. The fly ash samples, which originated from four different power plants, were mechanically activated. Mortars were heat-treated up to 1300 degrees C in a laboratory tunnel furnace with retention time 2 h. Thermal stability of crystalline phases were studied by differential thermal analysis (DTA); thermally induced changes in mineral phase composition were analyzed by XRD; and microstructure were investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Correlated results of DTA, XRD, and SEM analyses indicated initiation of sintering processes at approximately 1300 degrees C and formation of thermally stable minerals (rankinite, gehlenite, anorthite, cristobalite). The investigation highlights a sustainable approach of using fly ash in developing ecofriendly mortars for high-temperature application.",2015
The Challenges Related to Interface Bond Characterization of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete With Implications for Bridge Rehabilitation Practices,`overlay; topping; thin-bonded; UHPC; interface bond; finite element; slant shear; pull-off; split tensile,,"Over the past decade there has been a significant increase in the number of concrete transportation structures reaching the end of their service lives, typically as a result of age and severe degradation. This deterioration is often the result of exposure to aggressive environments and substantial increases in vehicle loading. Rehabilitation is typically the most appropriate solution for these structures because of the high cost of full replacement, resulting in the need for cost-effective and suitable solutions for rehabilitation. Ultra-highperformance concrete (UHPC), one of the more recent advances in construction materials, appears to be a promising material for the repair of concrete structures. The potential benefit of UHPC is primarily derived from its negligible permeability, which prevents water or chemical penetration, and its high mechanical properties, which serve to increase the bearing capacity of the structure. Some of the primary challenges associated with the use of UHPC as a repair material are uncertainty in the bond performance and interaction with the existing substrate material. This paper focuses on the characterization of the interface bond and compatibility between UHPC and normal concrete. The testing program was conducted in the spirit of ASTM because no standard test methods currently exist for UHPC. In addition, a series of numerical models were developed to support the results obtained in the experimental investigations. The results highlight the exceptional performance of the bond, but they also demonstrate a number of challenges with respect to characterizing the bond. Specific challenges included characterization of surface roughness, premature specimen failure, material strength mismatch, and the quality and consistency of the testing methods used.",2015
Non-Destructive Testing of Concrete: A Review of Methods,,,"This paper reviews the most common non-destructive testing (NDT) methods of concrete structures as utilized by the structural engineering industry. The fundamentals of NDT methods are explored in regards to their potential, limitations, inspection techniques and interpretations. The factors that influence the success of NDT methods are discussed and ways to mediate their influence are recommended. Reference is made to standard guidelines for the application and interpretation of the discussed NDT methods. NDT of concrete was found to be gaining increasing acceptance as a means of evaluating the strength, uniformity, durability and other properties of existing concrete structures. Perceptions of NDT inadequacy were attributable to lack of understanding construction materials and NDT methods themselves. The intent of this paper is to address these concerns by identifying and describing the most common successful methods of NDT as applied to concrete structures.",2015
Effect of saturation degree of recycled aggregates on concrete properties,concrete; compressive strength; recycled aggregate; degree of saturation; surface hardness,,"Concrete imposes a significant effect on the environment due to the production of its components. Hence the direction today is targeted towards construction demolition waste and the methodology of enhancing the quality and quantity of recycled aggregates. This paper evaluates the implementation of crushed brick as coarse and fine aggregate for the replacement of natural aggregate in two separate water absorption conditions (7% air-dry and fully moist aggregates). The waste of crushed bricks was sieved and re-mixed in order to obtain the required gradation fractions (0-4; 4-8; 8-16; 16-32 mm). In different percentages, natural coarse and fine aggregates were substituted by crushed bricks aggregates (0, 55 and 75%). Laboratory tests were performed at the BME, Department of Construction Materials and Technologies. Aim of the study is to examine some concrete properties (compressive strength, surface hardness and watertightness) for both natural and recycled aggregates implementation. Results indicate a maximum reduction in compressive strength for fully saturated cases, higher reliability in case of 7% saturation for rebound values and a higher level of water penetration for maximum recycled aggregate application for fully saturated cases.",2015
Accelerated Carbonation of Steel Slag Compacts: Development of High Strength Construction Materials,accelerated carbonation; steel slag recycling; sustainable building materials; CO2 sequestration; carbonation technology,,"Mineral carbonation involves the capture and storage of carbon dioxide in carbonate minerals. Mineral carbonation presents opportunities for the recycling of steel slags and other alkaline residues that are currently landfilled. The Carbstone process was initially developed to transform non-hydraulic steel slags [stainless steel (SS) slag and basic oxygen furnace (BOF) slags] in high-quality construction materials. The process makes use of accelerated mineral carbonation by treating different types of steel slags with CO2 at elevated pressure (up to 2 MPa) and temperatures (20-140 degrees C). For SS slags, raising the temperature from 20 to 140 degrees C had a positive effect on the CO2 uptake, strength development, and the environmental properties (i.e., leaching of Cr and Mo) of the carbonated slag compacts. For BOF slags, raising the temperature was not beneficial for the carbonation process. Elevated CO2 pressure and CO2 concentration of the feed gas had a positive effect on the CO2 uptake and strength development for both types of steel slags. In addition, the compaction force had a positive effect on the strength development. The carbonates that are produced in situ during the carbonation reaction act as a binder, cementing the slag particles together. The carbonated compacts (Carbstones) have technical properties that are equivalent to conventional concrete products. An additional advantage is that the carbonated materials sequester 100-150 g CO2/kg slag. The technology was developed on lab scale by the optimization of process parameters with regard to compressive strength development, CO2 uptake, and environmental properties of the carbonated construction materials. The Carbstone technology was validated using (semi-) industrial equipment and process conditions.",2015
Mass timber construction as an alternative to concrete and steel in the Australia building industry: a PESTEL evaluation of the potential,Mass timber construction; PESTEL; Cross-laminated timber; Australia,,"The present paper is the first to conceptually assess the viability of mass timber construction (MTC) as an alternative construction material/ method in Australia. It fulfills an identified need to examine an innovative construction process providing much needed information concerning the technologies current position and future disruption to traditional construction methods. A common tool used in business management studies, the PESTEL model, Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal is employed to provide structure for a strategic analysis of the technology. Mass timber construction clearly demonstrates some advantages including cost savings, primarily in the reduction in on-site labour costs; a lower environmental impact and use of a renewable resource; and possibility of improved amenity and reduced running costs for owners and occupiers. The estimated market potential for MTC in Australia indicates that a local plant might be viable as the market grows, and warrants funding to underpin a full feasibility assessment.",2015
Milestones in the analysis of alkali-activated binders,fly ash; alkali-activation; slag; concrete,,"The use of alkali activation to achieve environmental savings in the production of construction materials is currently an extremely active area of research and development. There is now a diverse range of chemistries and applications that have been developed within the broader theme of 'alkali-activated materials', including the subclass of lower-calcium binders which are also known as 'geopolymers'. Academic research and commercial development have combined to bring these materials to a level of technological maturity where larger scale deployment is now taking place. This paper reviews some of the key aspects of alkali-activation technology which have brought the field to this point, with a particular view towards re-assessing key points and comments which have been raised in several historical reviews and discussions of this class of materials. Conclusions are therefore drawn regarding which among these key questions have been answered, and which remain outstanding in an engineering or scientific sense.",2015
Microstructure and durability of alkali-activated materials as key parameters for standardization,alkali-activated concrete; blast furnace slag; fly ash; microstructure; durability; commercialization,,"Alkali-activated concrete (AAC) has been commercialized as a low-CO2 construction material, but its adoption still faces several challenges, including standardization, lack of a dedicated supply chain, limited service track record, and the question of whether laboratory durability testing can predict service life. This paper outlines how using different precursors leads to the formation of different AAC phase assemblages, and how AAC can be recognized in standards using a performance-based approach independent of binder chemistry. Microstructural assessment of pastes, strength development, water permeability, and chloride migration of two AACs (100% slag and 1:1 slag:fly ash) are presented, and compared to Portland cement concrete. Manipulation of binder chemistry leads to differences in the properties of the AACs; however, both AACs assessed exhibited technical benefits in a performance-based comparison. AACs can meet the requirements of the equivalent performance concept, independent of the binder chemistry, supporting their scale-up, regulatory acceptance, and wider adoption.",2015
Push-out Tests of Innovative Shear Connectors Between Cold-formed Steel Section Integrated with Ferrocement Jacket,Push out test; cold-formed column; ferrocement jacket; shear connector; bolts; wire mesh,,"Traditional construction materials such as steel and concrete exhibit signs of deterioration over the years. This can be attributed either to the inherent nature of the materials or their weak resistance to adverse the environmental conditions and natural disasters, such as, fires, earth quakes, etc. The use of ferrocement as an external jacket to cold-formed column is presented in this study to provide an alternative solution to existing construction materials. Ferrocement is a special form of reinforced concrete, which exhibits a behavior that differs much from conventional reinforced concrete in strength performance and other potential applications. The use of ferrocement with cold-formed steel as composite column is a new approach to enhance the axial load capacity of the later. Hence, the composite action between ferrocement and cold-formed steel section have to be established by means of understanding the behavior of the proposed shear connectors. In this study, push-out test set-up is proposed for eight specimens with various shear connectors' configuration. The utilization of high strength self-compacting ferrocement mortar in the design of cold-formed steel integrated with ferrocement jacket as composite column is proposed. It was observed that ferrocement jacket with 12 mm bolt shear connectors showed the best shear capacity when compared to other proposed shear connectors.",2015
Steel Slag as A Road Construction Material,Steel slag; recycle; skid resistance; soil stabilization; industrial waste material; sustainability,,"Steel slag is a byproduct obtained from steel industry. It is generated as a residue during the production of steel. Because of the high disposal cost as a waste material and the overall positive features of steel slag, it has been declared a useful construction material, not an industrial waste by most of the developed countries. Successively, it is recycled as an aggregate for the construction of roads, soil stabilization, and base and for the surfacing of flexible pavement. Despite this, a large amount of steel slag generated from steel industries is disposed of in stockpiles to date. As a result, a large area of land is being sacrificed for the disposal of this useful resource. Many researchers have investigated the use of steel slag as an aggregate in the design of asphalt concrete for the road construction. The best management option for this by product is its recycling. This leads to reduction of landfills reserved for its disposal, saving the natural resources and attaining a potential environment. The purpose of this paper is to review the engineering properties of steel slag and its utilization for road construction in different ways.",2015

Environmental Effects on Material and Bond Durability of CFRP and AFRP for Prestressed Concrete Bridge Applications,,REINFORCED-CONCRETE; STRENGTH CONCRETE; COMPOSITES; TENDONS; REBARS; BEAMS; RODS,"Within the transportation community, steel is one of the most widely used construction materials; however, in most operating environments it corrodes, often resulting in a loss in capacity or serviceability. Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) have become a viable alternative to steel and continue to gain attention due to their high tensile strength and durability. To further the knowledge base of FRP, this paper focuses on the bond durability of unidirectional pultruded FRP bars-made with carbon (CFRP) and aramid (AFRP) fibers-in concrete after exposure to thermal fatigue and saltwater environments, for the purpose of understanding the performance of FRP for prestressing applications. Cube specimens containing AFRP, CFRP, and 2205 stainless steel (control) were exposed to these environments and then subjected to direct pullout tests to evaluate bond strength. Thermal fatigue caused the greatest reduction in bond capacity for all bar types, with CFRP retaining better performance than AFRP.",2015
Evaluation of mechanical characteristics of nano modified epoxy based polymers using molecular dynamics,Molecular dynamics; Epoxy polymers; Carbon nanotube; Nano modification; Mechanical response; Affinity index; Pull out simulations,WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; ELASTIC PROPERTIES; SIMULATION; COMPOSITES,"Epoxy polymers are finding large scale application in construction industry for repair and retrofitting of deficient concrete structures, because of their great compatibility with construction materials and laminate composites. There is a scope to enhance the physico-chemical and mechanical properties of commercially available epoxy polymers through nanoscale modification. But, the improvement in the properties of the polymeric matrix mainly depends on the compatibility and extent of interaction of nanoparticles with the epoxy polymers. With the exponential growth in the field of nanotechnology and nanoscience, number of potential and compatible nanoparticles is available which can be judiciously explored to engineer the epoxy polymer to attain the desirable properties. In view of this, Molecular Dynamics (MD) studies have been carried out to investigate the interaction of filament type nano materials such as Carbon Nanotube (CNT) with different types of epoxy polymers. Various types of resins and hardeners available in market and usually adopted in industrial applications have been considered for the study. Steered Molecular Dynamics simulation has been carried out individually on CNT and epoxy resins. CNTs of different chiralities and diameters and epoxy resins are subjected to constant velocity pulling and their responses are observed. Then, the interaction of each of the epoxy polymer with CNT is investigated. In order to verify the results obtained from the affinity test using the interaction energy, pull out simulations have also been carried out. It has been found that pull out test results strongly supports the results obtained from the study using interaction energy in choosing the best and worst performing resins for nano engineering using CNT. From the study, the suitable resin and compatible epoxy is identified for CNT modification to ensure better performance of structures towards their repair and retrofitting. A new parameter has been proposed in the present study to uniquely quantify the extent of interaction of the polymer with CNT. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",2015

The goal is to quantify the carbon footprint and identify the critical stages of those activities. The quantification of CO2-e was determined by the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC). The results show that the crushing process is the critical stage because of its high electric power consumption. These factors should be addressed in future Brazilian environmental studies in order to find alternative solutions prior to exploring new quarries. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Characterisation and utilisation of steel slag for the construction of roads and highways,Steel slag; Recycle; Soil stabilisation; Industrial waste material; Environment friendly; Leaching; Sustainable green pavement,BASIC OXYGEN FURNACE; ELECTRIC-ARC FURNACE; ASPHALT MIXTURE; AGGREGATE; SOIL; CONCRETE; ASH,"Steel slags are by-products from steel industries which can be used for the construction of roads and highways. Most of the physical and mechanical properties of steel slags are similar or better compared to conventional crushed stone aggregates. Most of the developed countries have successfully incorporating steel slags as an aggregate in hot mix asphalt, road base, sub-base and soil stabilisation in road works. This paper is a review of the physical, mechanical and chemical characteristics of steel slags and its utilisation in road pavement works. This paper highlights the flaws that need to be addressed, and further studies are required to develop an understanding of the potential of steel slag as a construction material. Hydrophobic property of steel slag provides a good adhesion with bitumen binder and helps to resist against the stripping and other defects of roads.

It is very clear that mineral precipitation has the potential to enhance construction material resistance towards degradation procedures. The appropriate microbial cell concentration (30 * 10(5) cells/ml) was introduced onto different structural concrete grades (40, 45 and 50 MPa) by mixing water. In order to study the durability of structural concrete against aggressive agents, specimens were immersed in different types of acids solution (5% H2SO4 and HCl) to compare their effects on 60th, 90th and 120th day. In general, sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid are known to be the most aggressive natural threats from industrial waters which can penetrate concrete to transfer the soluble calcium salts away from the cement matrix. The experimental results demonstrated that bio-concrete has less weight and strength losses when compared to the ordinary Portland cement concrete without microorganism. It was also found that maximum compressive strength and weight loss occurred during H2SO4 acid immersion as compared to HCl immersion. The density and uniformity of bio-concrete were examined using ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test. Microstructure chemical analysis was also quantified by energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) to justify the durability improvement in bacterial concrete. It was observed that less sulphur and chloride were noticed in bacterial concrete against H2SO4 and HCl, respectively in comparison to the ordinary Portland cement concrete due to calcite deposition.",2014

During the last decade, remarkable efforts have been made on the investigations for novel processing methodologies to prepare SNPs, resulting in better control of the size, shape, porosity and significant improvements in the physio-chemical properties. A number of techniques available for preparing SNPs namely, flame spray pyrolysis, chemical vapour deposition, microemulsion, ball milling, sol-gel etc. have resulted, a number of publications. Among these, preparation by sol-gel has been the focus of research as the synthesis is straightforward, scalable and controllable. Therefore, this review focuses on the recent progress in the field of synthesis of SNPs exhibiting ordered mesoporous structure, their distribution pattern, morphological attributes and applications. The mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) with good dispersion, varying morphology, narrow size distribution and homogeneous porous structure have been successfully prepared using organic and inorganic templates. The soft template assisted synthesis using surfactants for obtaining desirable shapes, pores, morphology and mechanisms proposed has been reviewed. Apart from single template, double and mixed surfactants, electrolytes, polymers etc. as templates have also been intensively discussed. The influence of reaction conditions such as temperature, pH, concentration of reagents, drying techniques, solvents, precursor, aging time etc. have also been deliberated. These MSNPs are suitable for a variety of applications viz., in the drug delivery systems, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), biosensors, cosmetics as well as construction materials. The applications of these SNPs have also been briefly summarized. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2014

Its use throughout the centuries has changed from massive stone blocks for walls to thin tiles that are part of the cladding system of the facade of buildings. The objective of this paper is to compare the most commonly used wall systems with stone in an attempt to determine the best use for this material from an environmental point of view. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of three different wall systems has been carried out using data collected from two quarries and processing facilities in Switzerland. The analysis has shown that the use of a thin cladding in the facade is not necessarily the most sustainable solution and that the type of stone product to be used in a structure largely depends on the local availability of the material.

Critical buckling strength prediction of pultruded glass fiber reinforced polymeric composite columns,Strain energy; eccentricity; glass fiber reinforced polymer; compression; pultrusion; column,DESIGN,"Glass fiber reinforced polymeric composites are unique and unlike conventional construction materials (steel, timber, concrete), inadequate design standards are holding back the high volume use of fiber reinforced polymer composites in construction. To alleviate part of this difficulty, this paper investigates several column failure prediction models. Composite material properties were developed by testing coupons and 0.30m long components under compression. Furthermore, a strain energy density failure model developed at West Virginia University in tension and bending was extended to axial compression, predicting the critical buckling load within 10% of experimental failure for different column lengths tested (1.83m, 2.60m, 2.75m, 3.05m). In conjunction with failure analyses, load-deflection effects enhanced by eccentricity due to loading and initial out-of-straightness were also investigated. The current research found that the preliminary design limit of column height (h/220) is acceptable under axial loads; however, manufacturing related imperfection limit state of h/700 is slightly low.",2014

The eco-binder without cement, SCA, was made with slag (S) and fly ash (CA) that had been created by circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC). Experimental results show that the pure slag paste hardly sets and the pure CA paste gives very little strength. But when slag and CA are mixed together, the SCA paste not only has proper setting times but also has sufficient strength. The compressive and tensile strength of SCA paste can reach 80MPa and 4.6MPa, respectively, at 28days and higher at longer ages. In addition, the early expansion of the SCA paste compensates for its later shrinkage so that the ultimate drying shrinkage of SCA paste is lower than that of ordinary portland cement paste. The hydration products of the SCA paste detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) are ettringite, calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), and calcium silicate alumina hydrate (C-S-A-H).

Although, significant quantities of coal fly ash and coal bottom ash are produced worldwide every year, less than 30 % of coal ash produced is reused. Coal ash is mainly reused in civil engineering applications such as road construction, embankments, construction materials, geo-polymer applications and in cement production. Other potential reuse options for coal ash include applications such as glass ceramics, water and wastewater treatment, agriculture as well as for making high value products (e.g. telescope mirrors, break-liners, fire proof products etc.). Considering that only a small fraction of coal ash is reused, other reuse options for commercial applications need to be explored.",2014
Experimental investigations on Textile-Reinforced Concrete (TRC) sandwich sections,Sandwich section; Sandwich panel; Textile-Reinforced Concrete; Shear grid; TM-connector; Polymeric rigid foam,LOAD-BEARING BEHAVIOR; PANELS,"Textile-Reinforced Concrete (TRC) is a new construction material that offers several advantages over steel reinforced concrete. These advantages are particularly relevant for applications requiring thin-walled, structural elements with a high load-carrying capacity. For example, sandwich panels, made of two thin TRC facings and a core of polymeric rigid foam present an attractive choice for modern building envelopes. These combine low weight with a high structural capacity, while simultaneously fulfilling structural and physical demands. The development of sandwich panels made of TRC has been the subject of several research projects at the Institute for Structural Concrete of RWTH Aachen University in Germany. The present paper outlines the testing procedure of sandwich sections made of TRC and their load-carrying behaviour subjected to tension, shear forces, and bending moments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Utilization of radioactive high-calcium Mongolian flyash for the preparation of alkali-activated geopolymers for safe use as construction materials,Mechanical properties; Radioactive fly ashes; C-class fly ashes; Alkaline activated materials; Durability,CONCRETE; MINERALS; CEMENT,"Fly ash from the 4th thermal power station of Ulaanbaatar city has two drawbacks to its use as a raw material for producing geopolymers suitable for construction applications; these are its high radium equivalent radioactivity resulting from the radioactive Mongolian coal burnt in this power station (314-343 Bq/kg), and its high CaO content (14-30 wt%). Two fly ashes, from the Baganuur and Shivee Ovoo coal deposits were activated either by sodium hydroxide solution or mixtures of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate solutions and cured at 70 degrees C for 22 h. Flash setting of these high-calcium fly ash systems occurs where the activating solutions contain sodium silicate in addition to NaOH, but the fly ashes can be activated by 8 M NaOH solution alone, producing pastes with usefully long setting times (up to 10 h) and good 7-day compressive strengths (up to 32 MPa in the Baganuur ash and 23 MPa in the Shivee Ovoo fly ash). The addition of 1-5 mm river gravels produced geopolymer concretes with 7-day compressive strengths of 26 MPa and good freeze-thaw resistance. The radioactivity of the concretes prepared from these fly ashes was 130-152 Bq/kg, well within the standard safe limits for construction of dwellings. The durability of the concrete is influenced by the mineralogy of the calcium component of the fly ash; the presence of crystalline calcium components such as lime, anhydrite and amorphous calcium compounds in the higher-Ca Shivee Ovoo fly ash negatively influencing the freeze-thaw resistance. By contrast, Baganuur fly ash, which contains less calcium in the form of crystalline components, produces a geopolymer concrete with high durability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

"Particle size, size distribution and morphological evaluation of glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP) industrial by-product",Image analysis; ImageJ; Glass reinforced plastic; Scanning electron microscopy,SCANNING-ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; AIRBORNE DUST PARTICLES; CONCRETE; CEMENT; WASTE; WOOD,"The waste management of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GRP) materials, in particular those made with thermosetting resins, is a critical issue for the composites industry because these materials cannot be reprocessed. Therefore, most thermosetting GRP waste is presently sent to landfill, in spite of the significant environmental impact caused by their disposal in this way. The limited GRP waste recycling worldwide is mostly due to its intrinsic thermosetting properties, lack of characterization data and unavailability of viable recycling and recovery routes. One of the possibility for re-using GRP industrial by-product is in form of powder as a partial aggregate replacement or filler addition in cement based composites for applications in sustainable construction materials and technologies. However, the feasibility of this kind of reutilization strongly depends on the morphology and particle size distribution of a powder made up of polymer granules and glass fibers. In the present study, the use of image analysis method, based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Image' processing program, is proposed in order to evaluate the morphology of the particles and measure the particle size and size distribution of fine GRP waste powder. The obtained results show a great potential of such a method in order to be considered as a standardized method of measurement and analysis in order to characterize the grain size and size distribution of GRP particles before exploiting any compatibility issue for its recycling management.

Bending fracture of textile reinforced cement laminates monitored by acoustic emission: Influence of aspect ratio,Inorganic Phosphate Cement (IPC); Textile reinforced cement composites (TRC); Bending; Fracture mode; Interlaminar shear; Frequency; Monitoring; RA value,CONCRETE STRUCTURES; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; MECHANISMS; MODE,"Textile reinforced cement based composites (TRC) are a new class of sustainable construction materials with superior tensile strength and ductility. These materials have the potential for becoming load bearing structural members, therefore a wide array of structural and non-structural applications are possible. However, their heterogeneous, laminated, fibrous nature complicates the understanding of their fracture behavior. During bending, the developed stresses lead to the activation of damage mechanisms like matrix cracking, fiber pull-out delamination and in succession or in overlap. In this study, the flexural behavior of TRC laminates is monitored by acoustic emission (AE). AE sensors record the elastic waves radiated from the damage sources and enable the characterization of the fracture behavior in any stage. The aim is to examine if AE is sensitive enough to provide feedback on the applied stress field in such heterogeneous systems. Therefore, the three-point bending span is varied to modify the stress field and specifically the proportion of shear to normal stress. AE waveform parameters like duration and frequency reveal information about the mode of fracture for the different spans, while the stress field is derived by a finite element model (FEM). The results show that AE is suitable to characterize the stress field even from the early loading stages, monitor the corresponding damage mechanisms and provide valuable feedback to the material modeling.

Recent Advances in Coal Bottom Ash Use as a New Common Portland Cement Constituent,coal bottom ash; flexural-compressive strength correlation; cement constituents; flexural strength; concrete durability,FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; MORTARS,"New additions to cement will help to obtain sustainable and durable construction materials. One of these new Portland cement constituents could be coal bottom ash. Currently, it is dumped as waste, provoking an environmental problem. However, shows how this material can be used as the main constituent of Portland cement when it is mixed in an optimized proportion with fly ash. Therefore, this study may also be considered as a pre-standardization work to meet, partially, an environmental demand of society. The compressive strength and durable characteristics of standardized mortars made of coal combustion bottom and fly ash are to mortars made of GEM I 42,5 N according to the European standard EN 197-1:2011, which is used as reference. The mortars made up of bottom ash, fly ash and ordinary Portland cement mixes have similar proportions to the standardized ones for CEM II/A-V, CEM II/B-V and CEM IV/A (V) cements. It was concluded that the utilization of bottom ash mixed with fly ash does not modify the compressive strength or durable characteristics of the mortars studied in this research program.",2014

Shear in SFRC Slabs Reinforced with High-Strength Steel,high-strength steel reinforcement; serviceability; shear; steel fiber-reinforced concrete,COMPRESSION-FIELD-THEORY; ONE-WAY SHEAR; CONCRETE ELEMENTS; BEHAVIOR; BEAMS; STIRRUPS,"The combined use of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) and high-performance deformed steel reinforcing bars in structural members offers the potential for enhanced strength and durability with extended service life compared to traditional construction materials. While the structural performance of members containing each of these materials has been considered individually in the past, there is limited research available to establish the shear design requirements for members containing both. This study examined the behavior of six large-scale shear-critical specimens with overall heights up to 1000 mm (39.4 in.). Specimens contained 1.0% volume fraction of hooked-end steel fibers and ASTM A1035 longitudinal steel reinforcement. The test results showed that the shear stress at failure decreased as the member depth increased and as the strain in the longitudinal reinforcement increased. These trends were similar to those established for plain concrete members, but in all cases the use of discrete fibers resulted in a significant increase in shear capacity relative to existing shear models for reinforced plain concrete slabs. An approach to increase the design shear strength of SFRC members relative to plain concrete members with similar reinforcement is presented.",2014
Geo-engineering evaluation of Termaber basalt rock mass for crushed stone aggregate and building stone from Central Ethiopia,Central Ethiopia; Termaber basalt; Mechanical properties; Dimension stone; Coarse aggregate,FLOOD; PERFORMANCE,"The geology of the central part of Ethiopia exhibits a variety of rock types that can potentially be developed for construction stone production, of which the most wide spread and important one is the Termaber basalt. Even though some preliminary work is done on these rocks towards construction material application, it remains largely that this resource is untouched and needs further scientific characterization for the use in large scale industrial application. Basaltic rocks have been widely used in many parts of the world as concrete aggregate and dimension stone for various civil structures. The present research study was carried out for Geo-engineering evaluation of Termaber basalt rock mass for crushed stone aggregate and building stone from Central Ethiopia (around Debre Birhan). The main objective of the present research study was to assess the general suitability of the Termaber basalt to be used as coarse aggregate for concrete mix and/or to utilize it as cut stone at industrial level. Only choice made with full knowledge of the basic characteristics of the material, of its performance and durability against the foreseen solicitations will ensure the necessary quality of the stone work and thereby a possibility to reach its intended service life. In order to meet out the objective of the present study, data from both field and laboratory were collected and analyzed. The field data included geological investigations based on different methods and sample collection while the laboratory work included, uniaxial compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, dynamic elasticity modulus, bulk density, water absorption, specific gravity, open porosity, aggregate impact value, petrographic examination and XRF, aggregate crushing value, Los Angeles abrasion value, sodium sulfate soundness, X-ray diffraction and alkali silica reactivity tests. The field and laboratory data were compiled and compared together to reveal the engineering performance of the rock mass in terms of cut stone and coarse aggregates. The basaltic rock shows a variety of textural and mineralogical characteristics which could affect their physical and mechanical properties as well as their use as construction material. The compressive strength of the basaltic rock ranges from 130 MPa to 350 MPa, ultrasonic pulse velocity from 4000 m/s to 7000 m/s, open porosity from 0.33% to 3.08%, bulk density from 2.6 g/cm(3) to 3.1 g/cm(3), dynamic elasticity modulus from 64 GPa to 129 GPa, etc. The petrographic examination also indicated some deleterious constituents within the middle basaltic flow layers however; there are distinct flow layers which could be used as dimension stone and coarse aggregate for concrete and asphalt mix. The field investigation as well as the laboratory tests conducted indicated the high potential of the Termaber basalt formation to be used as construction material with further refining works. The study presented in this paper was carried out on basalts that are widespread in the central highland of Ethiopia and that comprise the major source of local crushed rock aggregates and building stone.

Variations in embodied energy and carbon emission intensities of construction materials,Variation; Parameter; Embodied energy; Carbon emission; Australia; Malaysia,INPUT-OUTPUT-ANALYSIS; LIFE-CYCLE INVENTORIES; BUILDING CONSTRUCTION; SYSTEM BOUNDARY; FRAMEWORK; CONCRETE; WOOD; UNCERTAINTY; BALANCES; LCA,"Identification of parameter variation allows us to conduct more detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) of energy and carbon emission material over their lifecycle. Previous research studies have demonstrated that hybrid LCA (HLCA) can generally overcome the problems of incompleteness and accuracy of embodied energy (EE) and carbon (EC) emission assessment. Unfortunately, the current interpretation and quantification procedure has not been extensively and empirically studied in a qualitative manner, especially in hybridising between the process LCA and I-O LCA. To determine this weakness, this study empirically demonstrates the changes in EE and EC intensities caused by variations to key parameters in material production. Using Australia and Malaysia as a case study, the results are compared with previous hybrid models to identify key parameters and issues. The parameters considered in this study are technological changes, energy tariffs, primary energy factors, disaggregation constant, emission factors, and material price fluctuation. It was found that changes in technological efficiency, energy tariffs and material prices caused significant variations in the model. Finally, the comparison of hybrid models revealed that non-energy intensive materials greatly influence the variations due to high indirect energy and carbon emission in upstream boundary of material production, and as such, any decision related to these materials should be considered carefully.

It is the major source of Yellow River sediment. The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of producing a new structural material by using Pisha sandstone via alkali activation process. The variables of this study are alkali dosage, admixture content, curing conditions and curing age. SEM, TG-DTG and XRD observations were used to analyze the microstructure and indentify the crystalline phases of the alkaliactivation products respectively. Compressive strength was tested to evaluate the mechanical performance of the fabricated composites. It was shown that mechanical properties of the Pisha sandstone geopolymer composites will be significantly influenced by the curing age, alkali dosage and admixture content. The highest compressive strength of the composites is 20.3 MPa, and the corresponding softening coefficient at 90 days is 0.86.

Depletion of natural resources is one of such sustainability issues which we need to address in an efficient manner. The recent trend in construction industry is to use the alternative source of construction materials which can substitute the use of virgin materials in order to reduce environmental impact in terms of energy consumption, pollution, waste disposal and global warming. On the other hand, the waste generated from the demolition of old structure and construction activity is a matter of concern all over the world. Thus, recycling and reuse of these wastes may reduce the usage of natural resources and it can also serve towards the demand of environment. The present paper gives a brief status of recycled aggregate concrete made out of recycled aggregate, summarizes and critically analyses some of the most important research findings over the past few years regarding the material aspects. It also attempts to elucidate the approaches for the better performances, identifies the gaps in the existing knowledge and underlines the reasons why this promising technology has not become widely accepted by the construction industry. The practical problems with application of recycled aggregate in concrete are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Flexural beam fatigue strength evaluation of crushed brick as a supplementary material in cement stabilized recycled concrete aggregates,Recycled concrete aggregate; Crushed brick; Cement stabilization; Repeated Load Triaxial; Fatigue strength,PAVEMENT SUBBASE APPLICATIONS; RECLAIMED ASPHALT PAVEMENT; HIGH WATER-CONTENT; BLENDS; GLASS; CLAY; CONSTRUCTION; WASTE; BASES,"In recent years, efforts have been made by various researchers to explore the sustainable use of Construction and Demolition (C&D) materials as a construction material in civil engineering applications. Recycled crushed brick is a commonly found material from demolition activities and works to date on this material in pavement applications have been limited to its usage in unbound pavement layers. This research was undertaken to evaluate the performance of crushed brick as a supplementary material in cement stabilized recycled concrete aggregates. An extensive suite of tests were undertaken on the crushed brick and recycled concrete aggregate blends stabilized with 3% cement. The laboratory evaluation comprised pH, plasticity index, foreign materials content, particle size distribution, linear shrinkage, California Bearing Ratio, modified Proctor compaction, Repeated Load Triaxial test, Unconfined Compressive Strength Test and Flexural Beam Tests. The cement stabilized blends with up to 50% crushed brick content and 3% cement were found to have physical properties, which comply with the local state road authority requirements. The results of Repeated Load Triaxial tests indicated the Recycled Crushed Aggregate/Crushed Brick (RCA/CB) blends performed well with 50% Crushed Brick (CB) content just on the border line for bound pavement material. Unconfined Compression Strengths met the minimum requirement for 7 days of curing for all blends, while the 28 day strength of the blends also improved significantly. The results of the flexural beam tests were noted to be consistent with past works with cement stabilized quarry produced crushed rock products. The modulus of rupture and flexural modulus for all the cement-stabilized blends were found to be consistent with the previous works, which indicate that these blends are suitable for applications such as cement-stabilized pavement subbases. The fatigue life was also within the range that has been previously reported for quarry materials. The cement-stabilized blends with crushed brick as a supplementary material with up to 50% brick content and 3% cement were found to have physical and strength properties, which would comply with road authority requirements.

STUDY OF A ROAD TEST TRACK WITH AND WITHOUT CRUMB RUBBER. SOLUTIONS FOR NOISE POLLUTION,crumb rubber; end-of-life tire; noise pollution; tire/road noise,URBAN TRAFFIC NOISE; ASPHALT PAVEMENTS; BITUMINOUS MIXES; TIRE RUBBER; CONCRETE; SURFACE; PERFORMANCE; MIXTURES,"End-of-life tires are waste materials that pollute landscapes when they are disposed of in tire dumps. However, its life cycle is not finished when they are scrapped. The rubber of end-of-life tires could be used for new purposes as construction material in road rehabilitation. A gap-graded mix characterization was carried out in this work by means of laboratory and field performance tests. The mixture has a high content of crumb rubber (CR) by weight of bitumen. Crumb Rubber was added to the binder by a wet process. Close proximity methodology has been used in in-situ characterization of the acoustic behaviour. Moreover, absorption and dynamic stiffness tests were also conducted to determine the noise generation mechanisms involved in noise. According to the results achieved, a reduction of the noise emitted by the tire/pavement interaction could be accomplished with the construction of roads with mixture with CR added by a wet process. In addition, this would result in a decrease of the amount of waste tires in landfills.",2014
Evaluation of frost resistance of calcium silicate masonry units with ultrasonic pulse and resonance methods,calcium silicate brick; NDT; freeze-thaw resistance; ultrasonic pulse method; resonance method,CONCRETE,"Freeze-thaw resistance is one of the basic parameters of durability of construction materials. Methods of its evaluation vary; most often it is evaluated on the basis of strength of samples before and after the test of frost resistance. To certain extent, standards also codify the use of dynamic non-destructive methods (ultrasonic and pulse method) capable of detecting changes in micro-structure. The decisive factor for evaluation of frost resistance of calcium silicate bricks is compressive strength. Results of the research focused on verification of applicability of ultrasonic pulse method and resonance method proved practical applicability for evaluation of frost resistance of calcium silicate bricks. Difference between parameters of non-destructive testing before and after freezing was -1.1% to -9.9%, depending on the number of testing cycles and quality of calcium silicate bricks. Both ultrasonic pulse method and resonance method are applicable for evaluation of frost resistance of calcium silicate bricks. Relevant criteria were determined for evaluation of frost resistance of calcium silicate bricks based on the parameter of non-destructive tests.",2014

Lifecycle carbon implications of conventional and low-energy multi-storey timber building systems,Lifecycle; Carbon footprint; Wood-based building; Structural system; Massive timber; Beam-and-column; Volume elements,GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; UNITED-STATES; WOOD; PRODUCTS; BALANCES; CONCRETE; IMPACTS; COSTS,"A consequential-based lifecycle approach is used here to explore the carbon implications of conventional and low-energy versions of three timber multi-storey building systems. The building systems are made of massive wood using cross laminated timber (CLT) elements; beam-and-column using glulam and laminated veneer lumber (LVL) elements; and prefabricated modules using light-frame volume elements. The analysis encompasses the entire resource chains during the lifecycle of the buildings, and tracks the flows of carbon from fossil energy, industrial process reactions, changes in carbon stocks in materials, and potential avoided fossil emissions from substitution of fossil energy by woody residues. The results show that the low-energy version of the CLT building gives the lowest lifecycle carbon emission while the conventional version of the beam-and-column building gives the highest lifecycle emission. Compared to the conventional designs, the low-energy designs reduce the total carbon emissions (excluding from tap water heating and household and facility electricity) by 9%, 8% and 9% for the CLT, beam-and-column and modular systems, respectively, for a 50-year lifespan located in Vaxjo. The relative significance of the construction materials to the fossil carbon emission varies for the different energy-efficiency levels of the buildings, with insulation dominating for the low-energy houses and plasterboard dominating for the conventional houses.

Thermal and mechanical performance of natural mortar reinforced with date palm fibers for use as insulating materials in building,Date palm fibers; Building materials; Concrete; Thermal insulation; Thermal conductivity; Mechanical properties,LOW-COST; COMPOSITES; WOOD; CEMENT; CONCRETE; CONDUCTIVITY; MIXTURE; WASTE; CLAY; CORK,"This paper presents an investigation on the use of a new material, composed with natural cement, sand and date palm fibers (DPF). The mainsoal is to evaluate the possibility of using this new material as insulating building materials. Several composites were prepared for different weight concentrations (from 0% to 30%) and for three sizes of fibers. Water absorption, thermal conductivity and compressive strength were experimentally investigated. The results reveal that the incorporation of DPF reduces the thermal conductivity and the compressive strength of the composite while reducing the weight. For a DPF loading lower than 15%, the composite satisfies both thermal and mechanical requirements of construction materials, and they could be used for wall structures. Thus, utilization of DPF as filler in mortar seems to be a very promising option which allows to be applied as thermal insulation materials in buildings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of windshield waste glass on the properties of structural repair mortars,Windshield waste glass; Structural repair mortar; Cementitious materials; Pozzolanic activity,CEMENT; REPLACEMENT; DURABILITY; AGGREGATE; CONCRETE; FINE,"The use of waste glass incorporated into construction materials has been the focus of several studies. Its utilization in cementitious matrices as a cement surrogate has been the most suitable application because of its potential pozzolanic properties. In this study, the influence of varying the amount of cement replaced by waste glass on several mechanical properties considered essential to ensuring the performance of mortars in structural repair, such as compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, linear shrinkage and tensile bond strength, was analyzed. Additionally, the influence of waste glass on water absorption by capillarity and the microstructure of these mortars were also assessed. The results indicate the potential use of this waste material for cement mortars. The 5% replacement rate showed the best results. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Characterization of natural pozzolan-based geopolymeric binders,Basaltic ash; Natural pozzolan; Geopolymer; Compressive strength,BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; C-S-H; FLY-ASH; ALKALINE ACTIVATION; HYDRATION PRODUCTS; CEMENT; CONCRETE; TEMPERATURE; DURABILITY; REACTIVITY,"Properties and characteristics of fly ash- or slag-based geopolymers have been extensively explored but comparatively less information is available for natural pozzolan-based geopolymers. The present work focuses on microstructural characteristics of natural pozzolan-based geopolymers activated by sodium hydroxide and a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium silicate. Synchrotron XRD and SEM-EDS studies combined with compressive strength tests successfully demonstrate the feasibility of the use of natural pozzolan for sustainable construction material. It is concluded that the geopolymers have sufficient strength as structural materials and matrices contain C-S-H like crystal as well as zeolites of hydroxysodalite and zeolite Y. Two zeolites of hydroxysodalite and zeolite Y are found as the main activation products in sodium hydroxide activation. Substitution with sodium silicate solution yields higher compressive strength and a denser microstructure with dominant activation products of C-S-H like crystal, zeolite Y, and phillipsite. It has been proposed that the crystal size of the activation products ranges from 10 nm to 1 mu m. Different microstructural characteristics found herein provide a valuable information to develop natural pozzolan-based sustainable structural materials with improved properties.

"Tracking evolution of urban biogeochemical cycles: past, present, and future",Urban evolution; Urban succession; Urban karst; Urban watershed continuum,LONG-TERM SODIUM; LAND-USE; ORGANIC-CARBON; ROAD SALT; NUTRIENT RETENTION; STREAM RESTORATION; INORGANIC CARBON; RIVER NITROGEN; CHANNEL DESIGN; RURAL GRADIENT,"This overview and synthesis paper focuses on the evolution of urban biogeochemical cycles across time. We synthesize empirical data and review existing literature, including papers in this special issue, and we propose the concept of ""urban evolution."" The built environment often changes quickly in response to human activities, thus contributing to an urban evolution that affects structure, function, and ecosystem services of human settlements over time. Depending upon management, these changes can result in rapid losses of ecosystem functions/services or progress towards restoration. We explore urban evolution through empirical examples such as: (1) land development and nitrogen inputs within a metropolitan region over half a century; (2) watershed drainage by different forms of stormwater management over decades; (3) human-accelerated weathering in urbanized watersheds over decades; and (4) global salinization of freshwater across urbanizing landscapes over a century. We also synthesize concepts relevant to studying urban evolution of infrastructure and ecosystems including: (1) urban watersheds have challenged our whole notion of the ""watershed approach"" due to complex hydrologic boundaries and flow paths over time; (2) the urban hydrologic cycle evolves due to changing infrastructure and human water use over time; (3) the importance of extending research beyond individual sites using an urban watershed approach over space and time; (4) salinization as a universal tracer of watershed urbanization over time; (5) human-accelerated weathering of concrete and construction materials contributing to an ""urban karst"" over time; (6) human alteration of the carbon cycle in urban watersheds over time; and (7) detecting distinct biogeochemical signatures across cities globally over time. Our synthesis and this special issue suggest that urban biogeochemical cycles have exerted a major influence on the elemental composition of the Earth's surface from local to global scales. A new global research agenda is needed to track the evolution of urban biogeochemical cycles as land development proceeds and infrastructure/management changes so we can better evaluate potential losses in ecosystem services, set realistic watershed and river restoration goals, and formulate effective environmental policy for Earth's growing urban population.",2014
Spectral absorption of spatial and temporal ground penetrating radar signals by water in construction materials,Ground penetrating radar (GPR); Short time-Fourier transform (STFT); Wavelet transform (WT); Spatial and temporal spectral absorption; Construction materials; Dual-polarization,DATA FUSION TECHNIQUE; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; CONCRETE; GPR; 3D-VISUALIZATION; INSPECTION; MOISTURE; BRIDGES,"This paper studies the spatial and temporal spectral absorption of reflector signals of a 1.5 GHz ground penetrating radar (GPR) during a drying process of a brickwall from initial wet to later dry state. The non-stationary GPR signals were processed with short time-Fourier transform (STFT) and wavelet transform (WT) in a novel spatial-time-frequency (STF) domain. Spatial distribution of peak frequency at the direct wave (DW) across the antenna and a backwall reflection was studied to characterize the mechanism of spectral absorption of GPR wave. Results from WT were shown to be more preferred to those from STFT because the WT offers multiple resolutions to cope with both low and high frequency components in GPR wavelets but STFT does not. In addition to the traditional GPR signal interpretation in time-domain and our previous works on time-frequency domain, the analysis method operated in the STF domain provides another possibility of material characterization by GPR in large and field scale.

Dynamic fragmentation of concrete using electric discharge impulses,Electric discharge impulse; Controlled dynamic demolition; Wave dynamics; Fracture mechanism; Finite difference method,,"We study dynamic fracture in construction materials induced by electric discharge impulses (EDI) that evaporate self-reactive liquid and produce high pressures in blast holes. Detailed observations utilising a high-speed digital video camera and a three-dimensional finite difference code show cracks generated in cylindrical concrete columns by means of EDI are controlled by direct and reflected waves and widened later by gas pressurisation, just as in the case of conventional blasting. Thus, wave-based analysis developed for blasting using explosives is valid also for EDI crushing, making it an ideal methodology to achieve controlled smooth dynamic fragmentation of construction materials and structures.

Use of sugarcane bagasse ash as brick material,Bricks; quarry dust; lime; sugarcane bagasse ash,FLY-ASH; BUILDING-MATERIALS; WASTE; CONSTRUCTION; DUST; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; MASONRY; SLUDGE; ENERGY,"Application of bio-fuel by-product sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA) as a principal raw material for the manufacturing of bricks was studied. The bricks were developed using the quarry dust (QD) as a replacement to natural river sand and lime (L) as a binder. SBA as a principal raw material was characterized using X-ray fluorescence (XRF), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRF confirms SBA as a cementitious material. TGA confirms thermal stability till 650 degrees C, whereas SEM monograph shows individual ash with a rough surface and numerous fine pores. Elemental analysis of quarry dust and lime was also carried out using XRF and classic wet test. The physical properties of quarry dust and lime were determined using the laboratory test methods. SBA-QD-L combination bricks were designed and developed in different mix proportions. Physico-mechanical properties of the developed bricks were studied according to recommended standards. The results of the SBA-QD-L bricks were compared with physico-mechanical properties of commercially available burnt clay-and-fly-ash bricks. It was observed that SBA-QD-L bricks are lighter in weight, energy efficient and meet compressive strength requirements of IS 1077:1992. The bricks also serve the purpose of solid waste management and innovative sustainable construction material. The bricks can be used in local construction especially for non-load-bearing walls.",2014
Green gold of Africa - Can growing native bamboo in Ethiopia become a commercially viable business?,sustainable business model; natural fibre material; bamboo composite,,"With concerns about climate change and the search for sustainable construction materials, significant attention is now being paid to Africa's natural resources. Ethiopia, known as Africa's political capital, has a rapidly expanding economy with increasing demand for new construction materials. Through public private partnerships projects the country is developing a sustainable business model to promote bamboo as a raw material. The subtropical zone of Ethiopia is home to approximately 65% of Africa's bamboo resources, an area of over 1 million hectares. Bamboo is potentially an ideal source of local, sustainable purpose-engineered building materials for growing cities not only in Ethiopia but across Africa. Production of conventional construction materials such as steel and concrete is expensive, highly energy intensive and unsustainable, requiring large quantities of water and is strongly dependent on imported raw materials. Bamboo is a renewable building material widely cultivated in Ethiopia but not yet utilized in modern construction. Structural Bamboo Products (SBP), similar to engineered wood products, have excellent potential to partially replace the use of more energy-intensive materials. Projects such as African Bamboo are taking steps in managing, cultivating and using Ethiopian bamboo species to help mitigate rapid deforestation in East Africa by creating alternative ""wood"" sources and sustainable business opportunities.",2014
Characterization of Tunisian marine sediments in Rades and Gabes harbors,Sediments; Characterization; Geotechnical; Environmental; Valorization,ORGANIC-MATTER; DREDGED SEDIMENTS; IGNITION; CEMENT; PHOSPHOGYPSUM; VALORIZATION; DURABILITY; MANAGEMENT; CARBONATE; CONCRETE,"The objective of this article is to study the geotechnical and environmental characteristics of sediments dredged from two Tunisian harbors: Rades and Gabes. The first harbor represents the main facility place in the national transport chain. The second one is selected as its sediments present a serious ecological constraint caused by the discharge of wastes into the marine environment. These sediments are either discarded at sea or landfilled despite their harmful effects on the environment. The article is divided into three main sections. The first one presents the material that was carried for Rades and Gabes harbors. The conservation conditions and the used experimental tests are detailed. Geotechnical characterization includes the determination of the grain size distribution, the water content, the Atterberg limits, the methylene blue value, the specific area, the bulk density, the specific unit weight, the organic and carbonate contents. Environmental characterization is assessed by the determination of metals concentrations in a leaching solution. The second section deals with the description and analysis of geotechnical properties of Rades and Gabes harbors' sediments. The results obtained show that Rades harbor sediments are slightly sandy clayey silts whereas Gabes harbor sediments are silty sands characterized by a highly plastic clay fraction. Both of the two sediments don't exhibit a high organic content. Finally, chemical, mineralogical and environmental properties are presented and then analysed. The experimental results obtained show that Rades and Gabes sediments could be used as a sand substitute in the formulation of a new construction material. Gabes harbor sediments are more polluted than Rades harbor sediments.",2014
Determination of Optimum Glass Transition Temperature of Acrylic Acid Ester Copolymer to Improve Performance of Cement Matrixes,acrylic acid ester; glass transition temperature; polymerization; redispersible polymer powder,,"This study was conducted to determine an appropriate glass transition temperature of a polymer to improve performance of the polymer cement mortar and concrete. The glass transition temperature of the polymer, which was synthesized as a redispersible acrylic acid ester polymer, and physical properties of polymer cement mortar were evaluated. The polymer showed a lower glass transition temperature as the ratio of unsaturated hydrophobic ethylene monomer was increased. A decrease in glass transition temperature decreased the tensile strength, compressive strength, flexural strength, and volume change; increased the elongation, liquidity of polymer cement mortar, and adhesion; and delayed condensation. Scanning electron microscope and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results confirmed that a polymer film formed inside the cement matrix made mostly of carbon around pores and cracks inside the cement paste. A glass transition temperature of 0 to -11 degrees C (32 to 12.2 degrees F) showed the best results. These results can be used for developing novel construction materials.",2014
Moisture transfer and thermal properties of hemp-lime concretes,Lime-hemp concrete; Pozzolans; Moisture transfer; Thermal conductivity; Specific heat capacity,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MORTARS; CEMENT,"Lime-hemp concrete is a low-embodied energy, carbon-negative, sustainable construction material made with a lime-based binder and hemp aggregate. This work investigates moisture and thermal properties of hemp concretes made with hydrated lime and pozzolans, and those including hydraulic lime and cement. The paper concludes that the type of binder influences capillary action of hemp concrete and that increasing the hydraulicity of the binder, as well as adding a water retainer, reduces capillary absorption. The impact of the binder type on permeability is less evident, and the results indicate that the large interparticular spaces between hemp particles (macropores) contribute to permeability to a greater extent than micropores (which are influenced by the hydraulicity of the binder). Finally, the binder type did not have a statistically significant impact on either thermal conductivity or specific heat capacity. A trend however suggests that increasing the binder's hydraulic content reduces thermal conductivity and increases heat capacity; and that the presence of water retainers enhances both conductivity and heat capacity.

Material and Structural Performance Evaluations of Hwangtoh Admixtures and Recycled PET Fiber-Added Eco-Friendly Concrete for CO2 Emission Reduction,eco-friendly concrete; Hwangtoh concrete; admixtures; short plastic fibers; recycling PET plastic; compressive strength; crack control; structural ductility,FLY-ASH MORTARS; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; CHLORIDE BINDING; CEMENT; BEHAVIOR; COMPOSITES; STRENGTH; BINDER; STEEL; CLAY,"In order to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and produce an eco-friendly construction material, a type of concrete that uses a minimal amount of cement, yet still retains equivalent properties to ordinary cement concrete, has been developed and studied all over the world. Hwangtoh, a type of red clay broadly deposited around the world, has traditionally been considered an eco-friendly construction material, with bonus advantages of having health and cost benefits. Presently, Hwangtoh is not commonly used as a modern construction material due to properties such as low strength and high rates of shrinkage cracking. Recent studies, however, have shown that Hwangtoh can be used as a mineral admixture to improve the strength of concrete. In addition, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers recycled from PET bottle waste can be used to control shrinkage cracks in Hwangtoh concrete. Therefore, in this study, performance verification is conducted on newly developed Hwangtoh concrete mixed with short recycled PET fibers. The results show that Hwangtoh concrete has compressive strength, elastic modulus, and pH properties that are similar to these features in ordinary cement concrete. The properties of carbonation depth and creep strain of Hwangtoh concrete, however, are larger and smaller, respectively, than in ordinary cement concrete. According to flexural tests, reinforced concrete (RC) specimens cast with Hwangtoh admixtures (with and without PET fibers) possess similar or better capacities than ordinary RC specimens. The addition of PET fibers significantly improves the structural ductility of RC specimens under normal environmental conditions. However, the implementations of the concrete in aggressive environment must be carefully considered, since a previous study result indicates degradation of its durability performance in aggressive environments, such as seawater [1]. The results of this study validate the possibility of using eco-friendly Hwangtoh concrete reinforced with recycled PET fibers as a structural material for modern construction.",2014
Chemical characterisation of metakaolin and fly ash based geopolymers during exposure to solvents used in carbon capture,Construction materials; Process equipment; Concrete; Geopolymer; Solvent processes,TECHNOLOGY; ZEOLITES; ACID,"This paper presents an investigation into the chemical resistance of blended alkali activated aluminosilicate materials, specifically under exposure to two solvents used in post-combustion carbon capture, monoethanolamine (MEA) and potassium carbonate, as well as during immersion in distilled water. Geopolymers are formulated based on metakaolin and on fly ash as aluminosilicate precursors, with the addition of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as a source of Ca. The samples are subjected to mineralogical and chemical characterisation in this paper, with data obtained through leaching analysis and X-ray diffraction, supported by compressive strength data. Exposure to solvents generally results in significant alteration of the geopolymer microstructure. The zeolitic phases formed in undamaged metakaolin-based binders are reduced to undetectable levels after 28 days of solvent exposure, although the hydrosodalite formed in the fly ash binders does persist. Leaching analysis indicates that resistance to structural damage in MEA is quite high, due to the low solubility of Na and hydroxides upon immersion. K2CO3 solutions are aggressive towards geopolymers via alteration of the binder structure and dissolution of network-forming species (Si and Al), leading to the loss of binder strength. This is most marked in the fly ash/GGBFS formulations. Despite the low to intermediate level of Ca present in these geopolymer binders, significant formation of Ca-containing carbonate phases occurs upon exposure to K2CO3. The limited curing duration of the specimens tested here is certainly contributing to the degradation taking place under K2CO3 exposure, whereas the low water activity in the MEA solutions used means that bond hydrolysis in the aluminosilicate geopolymer framework is restricted, and the materials perform much better than in a more water-rich environment.

Effect of phase change materials on the hydration reaction and kinetic of PCM-mortars,Phase change materials (PCMs); Langavant; DEM; Hydration degree; Damage,THERMAL MANAGEMENT; APPROXIMATION; BUILDINGS; CONCRETE,"The phase change materials are considered an attractive way to reduce energy consumption thanks to their heat storage capacity. Their incorporation in the construction materials allows the energy to be an integral part of the building structure. Even though PCMs have shown their reliability from a thermal point of view, some drawbacks linked to their use were emphasized such as the loss of the compressive strength of the PCM-material. This paper attempts to provide an explanation by the investigation of the hydration kinetic of PCM-mortars. The semi-adiabatic Langavant test was adapted to this case. The numerical diffuse element method was used for the computation of the heat flux, which is a compulsory step for the determination of the hydration degree. The results showed a lower heat released by the PCM mortars compared to a control mortar as well as a delay in the hydration progress with the addition of PCMs.",2014

Nano-mechanical behavior of a green ultra-high performance concrete,Ultra-high performance concrete; Nanoindentation; Microstructure; Fly ash; Elastic modulus; Hardness; Interfacial zone,REACTIVE POWDER CONCRETE; C-S-H; INTERFACIAL TRANSITION ZONE; CEMENT PASTE; SURFACE-ROUGHNESS; INSTRUMENTED INDENTATION; ELASTIC-MODULUS; FLY-ASH; NANOINDENTATION; AGGREGATE,"As a revolutionary construction material, ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) has been extensively studied in the last two decades and one research interest has been focused on preparing UHPC with low-priced raw materials or industrial by-products. In this study, a green UHPC which used high volumes of fly ash and river sand as part of raw materials was prepared, and the objective is to investigate the nano-mechanical behavior of the UHPC using nanoindentation. The results show that the hydration products, which account for about half of the paste by volume, are mainly high-stiffness hydrate phases, and significant quantities of unreacted cement and fly ash have higher mechanical properties than the hydration products and can function as micro-aggregates to strengthen the UHPC paste. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the paste near aggregate or fiber surfaces are similar to those of the bulk paste, which indicates that the UHPC has a strong and efficient bond at the interfacial zone. The experimental findings at the nano-scale could help to understand the macro-performance of the green UHPC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014

Therefore, environmentally friendly and economic solutions to recycle the resulting by-products are essential. The present study was performed to search for possible applications of the biomass bottom ashes that result from biomass combustion at three biomass combustion plants located in the Andalusia region of southern Spain. The analysis of chemical parameters indicated the applicability of biomass bottom ashes as an alternative material in civil construction. Thus, the limiting chemical parameters were analysed according to Spanish regulations. According to the results, biomass bottom ashes could be used as filler in road embankments, cement-treated materials or non-structural concrete, depending on the replacement percentage. This study determined that a review of the chemical parameters specified by the limiting regulations is recommended to promote the use of biomass bottom ashes as a building material in applications that do not require high structural strength.

Strength and Durability of Mortar Using Cork Waste Ash as Cement Replacement,cork waste ash; sustainability; durability; mortar; concrete,AGRO-WASTE; FLY-ASH; CONSTRUCTION,"Cork powder, the major waste from cork processing industries, is generated from grinding, cutting and finishing operations throughout the industrial cork process. Cork powder has been used mainly as fuel in cork industries. Cork waste ash is usually landfilled but if efficiently used in cement based construction materials it could contribute to sustainability. Strength and durability testing was undergone on mortar with 10 and 20% cement replacement with cork waste ash. Although strength is acceptable for 10% cement replacement with cork ash (5% loss at 90 days, compared to control), most durability properties (tested up to 6 months according to test type) reduced performance probably due to a broader pore structure caused by coarse particles in the ash which tested non pozzolanic. Moreover, cork waste ash does not present the necessary requirements in terms of chemical properties considering several standards. Present work has revealed that this cork waste cannot be used as a pozzolan or as a filler in cement based materials. In fact it is known that chemical composition of biomass ash is highly variable due to moisture variations, ash yield and different genetic types of inorganic matter in biomass and therefore it is important to pinpoint which types of biomass waste are adequate or not to use as cement replacement in construction.",2014
Infrastructure associated emissions for renewable diesel production from microalgae,Algae; Life-cycle analysis; Greenhouse gas emissions,,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for microalgae biofuel infrastructure are sometimes neglected during a life-cycle analysis (LCA). Construction materials were found for a baseline facility designed to produce renewable diesel in the United States. Material use was amortized over the material lifetime of thirty years and then, using emission factors available in GREET 2, energy use and GHG emissions were found per MJ of renewable diesel (MJ RD). For the baseline, infrastructure GHG emissions were 8.9 gCO(2)e/MJ RD. Plastic and concrete had the largest emissions, and the growth ponds used the most materials of any unit operation. Fossil fuels comprised 97% of all energy use, which came predominately from natural gas at 0.090 MJ/MJ RD. A sensitivity analysis showed that changes to the pond liner thickness and material lifetime had the largest effects with the lifetime increasing the GHG emissions 28% over the baseline. Increasing the productivity (up to 50 g/m(2)/d) or lipid content (up to 50 wt.%) decreased the emissions. Infrastructure emissions were compared to those from the fuel-cycle of a reduced emission scenario, showing that infrastructure related emissions ranged from 17% to 57% of the fuel-cycle emissions, with higher values at lower productivities.

One central issue for the building and construction industry to address global climate change is the development of a credible and meaningful way to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While Publicly Available Specification (PAS) 2050, the first international GHG standard, has been proven to be successful in standardizing the quantification process, its contribution to the management of carbon labels for construction materials is limited. With the recent publication of ISO 14067 [63]: Greenhouse gases - carbon footprint of products - requirements and guidelines for quantification and communication in May 2013, it is necessary for the building and construction industry to understand the past, present and future of the carbon labelling practices for construction materials. A systematic review shows that international GHG standards have been evolving in terms of providing additional guidance on communication and comparison, as well as less flexibility on the use of carbon labels. At the same time, carbon labelling schemes have been evolving on standardization and benchmarking. In addition, future actions are needed in the aspect of raising consumer awareness, providing benchmarking, ensuring standardization and developing simulation technologies in order for carbon labelling schemes for construction materials to provide credible, accurate and transparent information on GHG emissions.

SCC offers a safer construction process and durable concrete structure due to its typical fresh concrete behavior which is achieved by SCC's significantly different mixture composition. This modification of mix composition may have significant effect on the hardened mechanical properties of SCC as compared to normal vibrated concrete (NVC). Therefore, it is necessary to know whether the use of all rules and relations that have been formulated for NVC in current design codes based on years of experience are also valid for SCC. Furthermore, this study represents an extensive evaluation and comparison between mechanical properties of SCC using current international codes and prediction equations proposed by other researchers. Thus, in this experimental study, major mechanical properties of SCC are investigated for twelve SCC mixes with wide spectrum of different variables i.e. maximum coarse aggregate size, coarse aggregate volume and aging. In the present study, an extensive body of data reported by many researchers for SCC and NVC has been used to validate the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Physical and mechanical properties of foamed Portland cement composite containing crumb rubber from worn tires,,OF-LIFE TIRES; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; CONCRETE COMPOSITES; TYRE RUBBER; WASTE; MANAGEMENT; PARTICLES; STRENGTH,"The management of worn tires is a concern in industrialized countries. The application of crumb rubber as lightweight aggregate in cement based materials is a green alternative for reusing this material. High replacements of natural sand by crumb rubber were studied and an air-entraining agent was employed to ensure a cellular structure in the cement-based composite. The obtained results from tests in fresh state reveal an improvement in workability. The tests conducted on hardened composite show promise for constructive applications where thermal and acoustic properties are required. The minimum requirement of mechanical strength for masonry units was achieved, since compressive strengths varied between 1 and 10 MPa. Finally, potential applications as a construction material have been highlighted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Enhancing Recycling of Construction Materials: an Agent Based Model with Empirically Based Decision Parameters,Empirical Based Modelling; Agent Operationalization Approach; Socio-Technical System; Sustainable Resource Management; Multi Criteria Decision-Making,MATERIAL FLOW-ANALYSIS; INNOVATION DIFFUSION; ODD PROTOCOL; WASTE; SIMULATION; CONCRETE; SYSTEMS; WILL,"Recycling of construction material is a valuable option for minimizing construction & demolition waste streams to landfills and mitigating primary mineral resource depletion. Material flows in the construction sector are governed by a complex socio-technical system in which awarding authorities decide in interaction with other actors on the use of construction materials. Currently, construction & demolition waste is still mainly deposited in landfills, as construction actors lack the necessary information and training regarding the use of recycled materials, and as a result have low levels of acceptance for them. This paper presents an agent-based model of the Swiss recycled construction material market based on empirical data derived from the agent operationalization approach. It elaborates on how recycling of construction materials can be enhanced by analysing key factors affecting the demand for recycled construction materials and developing scenarios towards a sustainable construction waste management. Doing so it demonstrates how detailed empirical agent decision data were incrementally included in the ABM model. Raising construction actors' awareness of recycled materials as a decision option, in combination with small price incentives was most effective for enhancing the use of recycled materials. This could lead to a 50% reduction of construction & demolition waste streams to landfills, and significantly reduce the environmental impacts related to concrete applications. From a methodological perspective, although the agent operationalization approach provides a large empirical foundation, incremental model development turned out to be particularly important for the traceability of results and a realistic system representation.",2014
Mechanical properties and durability of hemp-lime concretes,Hemp-lime concrete; Pozzolans; Strength; Freeze:thaw action; Salt exposure,PORE STRUCTURE; CEMENT MORTAR; CRYSTALLIZATION,"Hemp-lime concrete is a sustainable and carbon negative construction material. This paper investigates the effect of binder type on mechanical strength and durability (resistance to freeze-thaw, salt exposure and biodeterioration). It compares hemp-lime concretes made with a hydrated lime and pozzolan binder to those including hydraulic lime and cement. SEM analysis revealed abundant hydrates at the hemp interface of the strongly hydraulic commercial binder while the lime:pozzolan binders were mostly carbonated. Increasing binder hydraulicity enhances early strength development however, all concretes achieved similar compressive strengths at 1 year irrespective of the binder type. The concretes with lime:pozzolan binders are more sensitive to freeze:thaw action than those with more hydraulic binders. Salt exposure resulted in the precipitation of salt layers in the concrete however, this did not have a detrimental impact on the compressive strength of the concrete at 1 year. The results evidenced that hemp concrete is resistant to biodeterioration (7 month exposure). Finally, the addition of water retainer improved the early strength development and freeze:thaw resistance of the concrete with lime-pozzolan binder. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Durability Properties and Microstructure of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag Cement Concrete,blended cement; durability; GGBS; chloride penetration; concrete; carbonation; durability,COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; MINERAL ADMIXTURES; PERFORMANCE; CARBONATION,"Ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) is a green construction material used to produce durable concrete. The secondary pozzolanic reactions can result in reduced pore connectivity; therefore, replacing partial amount of Portland cement (PC) with GGBS can significantly reduce the risk of sulfate attack, alkali-silica reactions and chloride penetration. However, it may also reduce the concrete resistance against carbonation. Due to the time consuming process of concrete carbonation, many researchers have used accelerated carbonation test to shorten the experimental time. However, there are always some uncertainties in the accelerated carbonation test results. Most importantly, the moisture content and moisture profile of the concrete before the carbonation test can significantly affect the test results. In this work, more than 200 samples with various water-cementitious material ratios and various replacement percentages of GGBS were cast. The compressive strength, electrical resistivity, chloride permeability and carbonation tests were conducted. The moisture loss and microstructure of concrete were studied. The partial replacement of PC with GGBS produced considerable improvement on various properties of concrete.",2014

The adobe material is characterized as a brittle material; it has acceptable compression strength but it has poor performance under tensile and shear loading conditions. Numerical modelling is an alternative approach for studying the nonlinear behaviour of masonry structures such as adobe. The lack of a comprehensive experimental database on the adobe material properties motivated the study developed here. A set of a reference material parameters for the adobe were obtained from a calibration of numerical models based on a quasi-static cyclic in-plane test on full-scale adobe wall representative of the typical Peruvian adobe constructions. The numerical modelling, within the micro and macro modelling approach, lead to a good prediction of the in-plane seismic capacity and of the damage evolution in the adobe wall considered.",2014
Structural behavior of precast Ultra-High Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) cantilever retaining walls: Part I - Analysis and design procedures and Environmental Impact Calculations (EIC),Ultra-high Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC); Steel Fiber Reinforced Reactive Powder Concrete (SFR-RPC); sustainable development; Environmental Impact Calculations (EIC); concrete cantilever retaining walls; eurocode 7; eurocode 2,,"Ultra-high Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) is a new generation of cementitious based construction material developed in the mid 1990s that its unique characteristics such as high durability and impermeability, negligible shrinkage/creep and high impact resistance lead to almost maintenance free and direct enhancement of the life-span of a structure. UHPFRC is an ecofriendly and environmentally green construction material which has the capacity to compete not only with conventional Reinforced Concrete (RC) or prestressed concrete design, but it is also able to compete with conventional steel design. This paper is presented in two parts. The first part (Part I) of this paper presents the analysis and design procedures of the precast UHPFRC cantilever retaining walls as a sustainable alternative approach to conventional precast RC cantilever retaining walls.

The second part (Part II) of this paper evaluates the reliability of the precast UHPFRC cantilever retaining walls through experimental tests on full scale UHPFRC wall specimens. The EIC results proved that cantilever retaining walls fabricated from UHPFRC are generally more environmentally sustainable than those built of the conventional RC with respect to the reduction of CO2 emissions, Embodied Energy (EE) and Global Warming Potential (GWP).

This experimental program prepared a total matrix of 54 mixtures with w/b of 0.40 and 0.45; nominal air content of 2, 4, and 8%; and three types of supplementary cementitious materials and one ordinary portland cement in different combinations. Binder systems included ordinary portland cement, binary mixtures with slag cement, Classes F and C fly ash, and ternary mixtures containing a combination of slag cement and one type of fly ash. Workability, total air content, air void system parameters (i.e., spacing factor and specific surface) in fresh concrete, setting time, compressive strength, surface resistivity, and shrinkage were determined. Test results showed that ternary mixtures followed the trends of their constituent materials. Binary and ternary mixtures containing Class C fly ash and slag cement exhibited higher compressive strength than the control mixture.

VOCs intrusion into buildings driven only by diffusion was reproduced by a laboratory-scale experiment. Effective diffusion coefficients and fluxes of a group of selected chlorinated solvents and BTEX through two types of isolation material - that is, concrete (anhydrite screed) and geo-membrane - were estimated. The laboratory experiment indicated that the diffusive transfer of pollutants through sediments into indoor air of buildings cannot be prevented by building sealing material, but it could be attenuated to a certain degree by concrete and up to non-detectable levels by the geo-membrane. Effective diffusion coefficients through concrete and geo-membrane ranged from 3.17x10(-2) to 5.90x10(-5)cm(2)/s and from 5.47x10(-6) to 5.50x10(-8)cm(2)/s, respectively.",2014
Fibre-reinforced geopolymer concrete with ambient curing for in situ applications,,FLY-ASH GEOPOLYMER; STRENGTH; COLUMNS; DUCTILITY,"Geopolymer concrete is proven to have excellent engineering properties with a reduced carbon footprint. It not only reduces the greenhouse gas emissions (compared to Portland cement-based concrete) but also utilises a large amount of industrial waste materials such as fly ash and slag. Due to these positive attributes, it is becoming an increasingly popular construction material. Previous studies on geopolymer concrete report that heat curing plays an important role in gaining higher compressive strength values (as opposed to ambient curing), and hence the application of this material could be limited to precast members. Therefore, this research was aimed at investigating the effect of heat curing by comparing the mechanical properties such as compressive strength and ductility of ambient cured and heat cured geopolymer concrete samples. It is worth noting that there was marginal strength change due to heat curing. In Australia, fibre-reinforced geopolymer concrete is being used in precast panels in underground constructions. Commercially available geopolymer cement and synthetic fibres are effectively being used to produce elements that are more durable than what is currently used in industry. As a result, this research investigated the effects of polypropylene fibres in geopolymer concrete using 0.05 and 0.15 % fibres (by weight). The addition of polypropylene fibres enhances the compressive strength and the ductility of geopolymer concrete.",2014

Their usage currently includes applications such as pavements, ground improvement, engineered fills, pipe bedding, backfill and aggregates in concrete. A comprehensive laboratory evaluation of physical and shear strength characteristics of recycled C&D materials was undertaken using gradation, Los Angeles Abrasion, unconfined compression, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), direct shear and consolidated drained triaxial tests. The recycled C&D materials evaluated were recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), crushed brick (CB), reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), waste excavation rock (WR), fine recycled glass (FRG) and medium recycled glass (MRG). All the recycled C&D materials are classified as well-graded materials and their compaction curves are controlled by water absorption and surface characteristics. RAP, FRG and MRG exhibit flat compaction curves while RCA, WR and CB exhibit bell-shaped compaction curves. The shear responses of the recycled C&D materials are classified into two groups: dilatancy induced peak strength and dilatancy associated strain-hardening behaviors. RCA, WR and CB are dilatancy induced peak strength materials in that their peak strength is clearly observed after the maximum dilataiicy ratio occurs. Higher dilatancy ratios in these materials are associated with higher peak friction angles. RAP, FRG and MRG on the other hand are dilatancy associated strain-hardening materials, which exhibit strain-hardening behavior even with a relatively high magnitude of dilatancy. Based on the evaluation of the shear strength characteristics, it is ascertained that the compacted C&D materials have the potential to be used in pavement base/subbase applications as they have the required minimum effective friction angles. RCA, CB and WR in particular are found to also meet the physical and shear strength requirements for aggregates in pavement base/subbase applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

These systems, however, suffer from high initial and maintenance costs. An alternative strategy to obtain green facades is the direct natural colonisation of the cementitious construction materials constituting the wall, a phenomenon governed by the bioreceptivity of such material. This work aims at assessing the suitability of magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) materials to allow a rapid natural colonisation taking carbonated OPC samples as a reference material. For that, the aggregate size, the w/c ratio and the amount of cement paste of mortars made of both binders were modified. The assessment of the different bioreceptivities was conducted by means of an accelerated algal fouling test MPC samples exhibited a faster fouling compared to OPC samples, which could be mainly attributed to the lower pH of the MPC binder. In addition to the binder, the fouling rate was governed by the roughness and the porosity of the material. MPC mortar withmoderate porosity and roughness appears to be the most feasible material to be used for the development of green concrete walls. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2014
Utilization of coal fly ash in solidification of liquid radioactive waste from research reactor,Fly ash; radioactive waste; sludge; solidification; waste management,NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY,"In this study, the potential utilization of fly ash was investigated as an additive in solidification process of radioactive waste sludge from research reactor. Coal formations include various percentages of natural radioactive elements; therefore, coal fly ash includes various levels of radioactivity. For this reason, fly ashes have to be evaluated for potential environmental implications in case of further usage in any construction material. But for use in solidification of radioactive sludge, the radiological effects of fly ash are in the range of radioactive waste management limits. The results show that fly ash has a strong fixing capacity for radioactive isotopes. Specimens with addition of 5-15% fly ash to concrete was observed to be sufficient to achieve the target compressive strength of 20 MPa required for near-surface disposal. An optimum mixture comprising 15% fly ash, 35% cement, and 50% radioactive waste sludge could provide the solidification required for long-term storage and disposal. The codisposal of radioactive fly ash with radioactive sludge by solidification decreases the usage of cement in solidification process. By this method, radioactive fly ash can become a valuable additive instead of industrial waste. This study supports the utilization of fly ash in industry and the solidification of radioactive waste in the nuclear industry.",2014
Influence of Mineral Admixtures on the Permeation Properties of Self-Compacting Concrete at Different Ages,Self-compacting concrete; Permeation properties; Natural Pozzolan; Economical concrete; Mineral addition,GAS-PERMEABILITY; FLY-ASH; DURABILITY; REPLACEMENT; CEMENTS,"Due to its specific properties, the study of self-compacting concrete (SCC) represents an area of research that has strong potential for development. However, in spite of the interest of researchers in this new material, SCC has not yet gained universal acceptance as a construction material, and its application remains limited. The development of an economical SCC with interesting properties in the fresh and hardened state is important for the acceptance of such a concrete. Algerian natural source Pozzolan is rarely used in SCC due to the absence of any thorough study of its properties. This study investigates the permeation properties of SCC mixtures made with this Algerian natural Pozzolan, compared with conventional vibrated concrete and other SCC mixtures containing fly ash or limestone filler. Additionally, the correlations between chloride diffusion and sorptivity, and between apparent gas permeability and chloride diffusion, were investigated. Results indicate that, despite its economic benefits, SCC incorporating natural Pozzolan presents very low permeation properties (for example: lower migration coefficients compared to the SCC mixtures with lime-stone filler or ordinary vibrated concrete (difference >50 % for results of the 30 MPa strength class). The relation between chloride diffusion and sorptivity, and between apparent gas permeability and chloride diffusion, is also confirmed.",2014

The CVVAs were porcelain insulator wastes supplied from an electric power company, which were crushed and ground to fine aggregate sizes. In this study, to further develop the CWA mortar as an eco-efficient construction material, ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) was incorporated. The slag (having the Blaine fineness of 6230 cm(2)/g) was utilized as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) at three different replacement levels of 15%, 30%, and 45% of cement by weight. The efficiency of the GGBS on enhancing chloride resistance in the CWA mortars was experimentally assessed by using a silver nitrate solution spray method and an electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The tests were carried out on mortar samples after immersed in a 5.0% NaCl solution for 24 weeks. Another set of the mortar samples was exposed to a laboratory ambient condition for 24 weeks and then followed with a carbonation test. The test results indicated that the resistance to the chloride ingress of the CWA mortar becomes more effective in proportion to the replacement level of the GGBS. In contrast, the carbonation depth of the CWA mortar increases with the increase of the GGBS. The activeness of the GGBS was also evaluated on the basis of the compressive strength development up to 91 days. Due to its high fineness, the GGBS can be used up to 30% while the high relative strength (more than 1.0) is achieved at all ages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014

LWA was produced from wet sewage sludge as a principal material and reservoir sediment as an additive material using sintering temperatures of 1,050-1,250 degrees C in order to improve their physical properties. The selected LWA was used as coarse aggregate in the manufacturing of high-flowing LWC. Results showed that a proper amount of reservoir sediment addition improved the aggregate size expansion, decreased bulk density, and also increased strength of aggregate. As a general overview, all aggregates produced in this study had a bulk density less than 2.0g/cm3. In addition, under proper sintering temperatures the water absorption of aggregate having reservoir sediment addition could be significantly reduced as low as 1.9%. A very good workable LWC was obtained with 28-day age compressive strength of 31.25MPa.

However, studies on estimating CO2 emission of new construction projects remain few and far between. Thus, this study aimed at developing a model for estimating CO2 emission based on materials required in the construction and maintenance phases of residential buildings prior to design completion. Toward this end, the study used a case-based reasoning approach to predict the quantities of materials required in the construction and maintenance phases. Furthermore, through the life-cycle assessment approach, this study established a database of CO2 emission to calculate CO2 emission according to the construction materials. The study then proposed a method that could estimate CO2 emission by using the predicted quantities of materials and the established database. To validate the developed model, the study performed five case studies. Results showed that the error ratios of the prediction were -4.26, -5.06, 7.37, -4.32, and -2.94%, respectively, in each of the cases, and CO2 emissions of materials for residential buildings could be estimated prior to design completion.

The effects of macro synthetic fiber reinforcement use on physical and mechanical properties of concrete,Fibers; Physical properties; Mechanical testing; Non-destructive testing,STEEL FIBERS,"Attempts to find a construction material having increased strength, ductility, toughness, and durability have led to interest in high performance fiber reinforced concrete. The use of such materials increases day by day. When the fibers are distributed in a homogeneous way and used in appropriate quantity inside the concrete, they reduce cracks, contribute to tensile strength, toughness, ductility and durability, and improve other mechanical properties. In this study, four types of concrete were produced: steel fiber (SFRC), polyester fiber (PYFRC), polypropylene fiber (PPFRC) reinforced concrete and a reference sample made of plain concrete (R1); these were then compared to one another. The ratio of fibers was used 4.25% of volume of concrete. The effects of the different types of fiber on hardened concrete were determined by conducting physical and mechanical experiments. Compressive strength, surface hardness, ultrasonic pulse velocity, carbonation, abrasion, capillarity and freeze thaw resistance experiments were conducted on hardened concretes. SFRC had higher 12.4%, PYFRC 3.4% higher and PPFRC 4.3% lower compressive strength with respect to RI. PPFRC showed 8.04% higher compressive strength than R1 when it was determined by the surface hardness method. SFRC showed 5.4% higher compressive strength than R1 when we applied the ultrasonic pulse velocity method. In the abrasion experiment, the highest abrasion was found in SFRC with similar to 0.5%, while the lowest was found in PPFRC at similar to 0.18%. The highest and lowest amount of capillary water absorption was seen in R1 and PYFRC, respectively. In a carbonation experiment, SFRC was determined similar to 130.8% higher than R1. It was concluded that the types of fiber used for reinforcement influenced the physical and mechanical properties of the concrete. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Cement and concrete as an engineering material: An historic appraisal and case study analysis,Cement and concrete; Historic development; Mechanical response; Structural failures; Failure case studies,,"Today, second only to water, concrete is the most consumed material, with three tonnes per year used for every person in the world. Twice as much concrete is used in construction as all other building materials combined. There is little doubt that concrete will remain in use as a construction material well into the future. However, with such extensive use of the material, discovery of any shortcoming or problem associated with concrete or reinforced concrete structures will become a matter of considerable public concern - both from a safety perspective and associated costs of rectification. Accordingly, this paper will initially review the historic development of cements and concrete and will then focus on the mechanical response of concrete and reinforced concrete to its working environment.

This difference may have remarkable influence on the mechanical behavior of SCC as compared to normal vibrated concrete (NVC) in hardened state. Therefore, it is vital to know whether the use of all assumptions and relations that have been formulated for NVC in current design codes are also valid for SCC. Furthermore, this study presents an extensive evaluation and comparison between mechanical properties of SCC using current international codes and predictive equations proposed by other researchers. Thus, in this experimental study, key mechanical properties of SCC are investigated for sixteen SCC mixes with different w/c ratios and different powder contents. In the present study, an extensive data reported by many researchers for SCC and NVC has been used to validate the obtained results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014

An initial assessment of building and infrastructure vulnerability has been carried out for a set of broadly defined building types and infrastructure categories, with the likelihood of damage considered separately for projectile impact, ash fall loading, pyroclastic density current dynamic pressure and earthquake ground shaking intensities. In refining these estimates for two case study areas: Kanlaon volcano in the Philippines and Fogo volcano in Cape Verde, we have developed guidelines and methodologies for carrying out physical vulnerability assessments in the field. These include identifying primary building characteristics, such as construction material and method, as well as subsidiary characteristics, for example the size and prevalence of openings, that may be important in assessing eruption impacts. At-risk buildings around Kanlaon were found to be dominated by timber frame buildings that exhibit a high vulnerability to pyroclastic density currents, but a low vulnerability to failure from seismic shaking. Around Fogo, the predominance of unreinforced masonry buildings with reinforced concrete slab roofs suggests a high vulnerability to volcanic earthquake but a low vulnerability to ash fall loading. Given the importance of agriculture for local livelihoods around Kanlaon and Fogo, we discuss the potential impact of infrastructure vulnerability for local agricultural economies, with implications for volcanic areas worldwide. These methodologies and tools go some way towards offering a standardised approach to carrying out future vulnerability assessments for populated volcanic areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, action is needed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, increase recycling and the reuse of materials and reduce water consumption. In this paper, the negative effect of the construction industry on climate is examined and remedial actions are proposed. A review of construction-related effects on climate change and sustainable construction is followed by a presentation of the authors' research on low-carbon dioxide concrete. Some examples of actions taken in Algeria to mimimise the effects of the industry on climate through research and practice are given. This mainly includes the use of cement replacement materials, recycling and efficient utilisation of resources.",2014
Optimized Design of Concrete Structures Considering Environmental Aspects,probability based design; environmental aspects; fibre concrete,MULTIOBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION; MAINTENANCE; MANAGEMENT; COST,"This contribution describes a formulation of the optimized design of structures using the probability-based optimization method. The Monte Carlo simulation method, modified by the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) method, was used for the calculation of the reliability of a designed structure. Efficient design procedures can achieve not only cost savings during construction (materials and energy), erection, servicing, maintenance, disassembly and material recycling but also a more favourable environmental impact. To find the best possible design for a structure an original optimization method was used. Therefore, the economical and ecological aspects (acquisition costs, CO2 and SO2 emissions and embodied energy associated with concrete member production) were taken into account in the objective function. A design example - a prestressed spun concrete pole made from reinforced concrete or alternatively from reinforced fibre concrete is presented.",2014
Physical Characterization of Natural Straw Fibers as Aggregates for Construction Materials Applications,straw fibers; agricultural residues; microstructure; hygroscopic; sorption,REINFORCED CONCRETE; BARLEY STRAW; BALE BUILDINGS; EARTH PLASTER; COMPOSITES; STRENGTH; MOISTURE; TEMPERATURE; QUALITY,"The aim of this paper is to find out new alternative materials that respond to sustainable development criteria. For this purpose, an original utilization of straw for the design of lightweight aggregate concretes is proposed. Four types of straw were used: three wheat straws and a barley straw. In the present study, the morphology and the porosity of the different straw aggregates was studied by SEM in order to understand their effects on the capillary structure and the hygroscopic behavior. The physical properties such as sorption-desorption isotherms, water absorption coefficient, pH, electrical conductivity and thermo-gravimetric analysis were also studied. As a result, it has been found that this new vegetable material has a very low bulk density, a high water absorption capacity and an excellent hydric regulator. The introduction of the straw in the water tends to make the environment more basic; this observation can slow carbonation of the binder matrix in the presence of the straw.",2014
The Use of Dredged Sediments as Sand in the Mortars for Tunnel Lining and for Environmental Protection,Sustainable development; Dredged sediments; Tunnel lining; Mortars; Mechanical properties; Durability,CONCRETE; HARBOR,"The economic activity of many ports in Algeria is hampered by the natural phenomenon of sediment accumulation. Dredging is a necessity; however, the storage of the dredged sediments (DS) is a problem for harbour managers. The easy and low-cost solution of dumping sediments at sea raises environmental concerns that could eventually be alleviated by considering these sediments as a new source of construction materials. This would contribute to the reduction of marine pollution and thus give harbour managers the opportunity to be part of the sustainable development approach. This paper examines the feasibility of using DS from the Port of Oran as partial replacement of sand in mortars. The physical, chemical and mineralogical properties of DS were determined after a zoning study was made. DS were treated in order to reduce their salt and water contents so that they could be used as a partial substitution of the sand in the composition of the mortars. The mechanical and durability properties of mortars fabricated by substituting 10, 15 and 20 % of sand mass by DS were determined and compared to those of the reference mortar. The compressive strengths of a first set of mortar specimens were determined after 7, 28, 60 and 90 days of moist curing. The second set of mortar specimens that were submitted to chemical attacks and their residual compressive strengths at 118 days were determined. So far, the preliminary laboratory tests show that partial replacement of 20 % of sand by DS in mortars gives good results.",2014

Carbon footprint and embodied energy assessment of a civil works program in a residential estate of Western Australia,Carbon footprint; Civil works; Recycling; Streamlined LCA,ROAD CONSTRUCTION,"With building construction and demolition waste accounting for 50 % of land fill space, the diversion of reusable materials is essential for Perth""s environment. The reuse and recovery of embodied energy-intensive construction materials during civil engineering works programs can offer significant energy savings and assist in the mitigation of the carbon footprint. A streamlined life cycle assessment, with limited focus, was carried out to determine the carbon footprint and embodied energy associated with a 100-m section of road base. A life cycle inventory of inputs (energy and materials) for all processes that occurred during the development of a 100-m road section was developed. Information regarding the energy and materials used for road construction work was obtained from the Perth-based firm, Cossill and Webley, Consulting Engineers. These inputs were inserted into Simapro LCA software to calculate the associated greenhouse gas emissions and embodied energy required for the construction and maintenance of a 100-m road section using. Two approaches were employed; a traditional approach that predominantly employed virgin materials, and a recycling approach. The GHG emissions and embodied energy associated with the construction of a 100-m road section using virgin materials are 180 tonnes of CO2-e and 10.7 terajoules (TJ), respectively. The substitution of crushed rock with recycled brick road base does not appear to reduce the carbon footprint in the pre-construction stage (i.e. from mining to material construction, plus transportation of materials to the construction site). However, this replacement could potentially offer environmental benefits by reducing quarrying activities, which would not only conserve native bushland but also reduce the loss of biodiversity along with reducing the space and cost requirements associated with landfill. In terms of carbon footprint, it appears that GHG emissions are reduced significantly when using recycled asphalt, as opposed to other materials. About 22 to 30 % of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be avoided by replacing 50 to 100 % of virgin asphalt with Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) during the maintenance period. The use of recycled building and road construction materials such as asphalt, concrete, and limestone can potentially reduce the embodied energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated with road construction. The recycling approach that uses 100 % reused crushed rock base and recycled concrete rubble, and 15 % RAP during the maintenance period could reduce the total carbon footprint by approximately 6 %. This large carbon saving in pavement construction is made possible by increasing the percentage of RAP in the wearing course.",2014
Life cycle carbon footprint measurement of Portland cement and ready mix concrete for a city with local scarcity of resources like Hong Kong,Carbon footprint; Life cycle; Portland cement; Ready mix concrete,EMISSIONS; INVENTORIES; MANUFACTURE; IMPACT; EU,"The construction sector was the second largest contributor of Hong Kong carbon emissions, and 85 % of the emission from construction was external in nature. The carbon footprint embodied in each building construction material varies considerably under different conditions. This study aims to quantify the embodied carbon footprint of building construction materials used in Hong Kong with the consideration of local factors and to investigate how the region-specific characteristic would affect the result. A ""cradle-to-site"" system boundary was used, including raw material extraction, manufacturing, and transport until the material reaches the construction site. Data were collected from manufacturers in local and nearby regions. Portland cement and ready mix concrete were selected as examples in this study to demonstrate the calculation. It is indicated that for cement, decomposition of limestone contributes the largest to the total greenhouse gas emission over the life cycle, followed by fuel combustion. The surveyed cement plant performs at an average level in manufacture, but the import of raw materials increases the total emissions. For concrete, the major contributor is cement manufacturing. Comparison with other databases reveals that there is room for improvement in carbon reduction of the surveyed plants. The ""cradle-to-site"" results on cement and concrete show no significant difference from the ""cradle-to-gate"" results. Hong Kong's dependency on imports increases the carbon footprint of locally used building construction materials. The presented methodology can be modified and extended to other materials, thereby helping lower the carbon footprint of construction activities by providing a benchmark for selecting green materials.",2014

Rice husk ash (RHA) contains over 60% silica, 10-40% carbon and minor other mineral composition, which is the by-product during the process of rice husk (RH) gasification/pyrolysis. More researchers become interested in how to use this industrial waste, because RHA is available in abundant, sustainable and almost free of cost. In recent years, RHA has been widely used as a construction material to product concrete, or as an adsorbent to adsorb organic dye, inorganic metal ions and waste gases. Due to its high silica content, RHA can be an economically viable raw material for the production of silicates and silica materials. Biochar and biosilica from high silicon-containing biomass, which can be fabricated into the high value-added porous carbon and silicon materials, such as silica/carbon nanoparticles, mesoporous silica/carbon, have lots of chemical and biological characterization for biomedical and electronical applications. Significantly, RH char, a hybrid composite can be converted in to the homogeneous carbon-silica nanocomposite (C/SiO2) via extraction, which is directly used for synthesis of highly ordered mesoporous carbon and silica materials via a triconstituent co-assembly approach to prepare well-ordered mesoporous polymer-silica and carbon-silica nanocomposites by using resols as a polymer precursor, silicate oligomers as an inorganic precursor, and triblock copolymer F127 as a template. In addition, these materials could be put into extensively use as adsorbents and catalysts for other environmental pollutants treatment. Thus, it has a significant meaning to be engaged in more research works on the physicochemical characteristics of waste biomass to realize the ""3R"" rules of reducing, reusing and recycling.

Experimental investigation on using Cement Kiln Dust (CKD) as a cement replacement material in producing modified cement mortar,Cement Kiln Dust; Image analysis; Cements mortar; OPC/CKD chemical composition; Fractal dimension; Pore-size distribution,CONCRETE; STRENGTH,"Concrete is regarded as the second consumed construction material and hence massive quantities of cement needs to be annually produced. This production leads to pollute the environment by releasing significant quantities of CO2 emission in addition to produce solid waste material known Cement Kiln Dust CKD. The aim of this investigation is to explore the possibility of using this material as a cement replacement in concrete mortar production, which occupies about half of the concrete volume. Chemical analysis and some physical properties of three different CKD replacements (10%, 20%, and 30% wt. of cement) in addition to reference mortar were investigated. The results showed that there is a systematic increase in mortar porosity with CKD replacement and this increase was in parallel decrease in mortar strength. Image processing was utilized to study the mortars in terms of 2-D porosity and cement paste color values. It was found that the calculated porosity using imageJ software also increased with CKD replacement and the pore-size distribution can be counted as fractal object, where the fractal dimension of these pores was calculated. Additionally, a good correlation between gray color value and compressive strength was also concluded. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Viscosity and Antiwashout Properties of Cement Mortar at Low Temperature Seawater Environment,Cement mortar; Antiwashout; Thixotropic; Mixed surfactant; Cold seawater,RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; SURFACTANT MIXTURES; UNDERWATER CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR,"Cement mortar is a construction material and generally a mixture of water, cement, sand and sometimes fine gravel. When cement mortar is applied to the seawater construction at low temperature below 0 degrees C, the flow performance, workability, placement, antiwashout and consolidation should be considered in combination. In this research, the antiwashout and rheological properties of the cement mortar have been investigated with admixtures prepared by adding anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and polymeric thickeners. Cement mortar formulated by pseudo-polymeric systems, electrostatic association of anionic and cationic surfactants and polymer additive such as poly methyl vinyl ether, showed thixotropic, suitable antiwashout, proper workability and self-leveling properties. Addition of isopropyl alcohol to mixed surfactant admixture decreases the freezing temperature of cement grout to similar to 7 degrees C and increases the workability at cold seawater, but slightly decreases the compressive strength of the cement grout at seawater system.",2014

Most studies have shown that the long-term properties of RAC are inferior to those of natural aggregate concrete (NAC), and some researchers have observed that the long-term properties are better than those of NAC. RAC's long-term properties are affected by many factors such as recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) replacement percentage, water-cement ratio, mineral admixtures and mix proportions. The long-term properties of RAC can be improved through better control of these factors.

Moreover, in recent years the energy demands for buildings have increased very rapidly due to increase in the growth rate of population and improvement in living standards of people. Furthermore, fossil fuels will continue to dominate the world's primary energy by 2030. Thus, the increase in energy demand, shortage of fossil fuels and environmental concerns has provided impetus to the development of sustainable building and renewable energy resources. Thermal energy storage is an efficient method for applying to building envelopes to improve the energy efficiency of buildings. This, in turn, reduces the environmental impact related to energy usage. The combination of construction materials and PCM is an efficient way to increase the thermal energy storage capacity of construction elements. Therefore, an extensive review on the incorporation of PCM into construction materials and elements by direct incorporation, immersion, encapsulation, shape-stabilization and form-stable composite PCMs is presented. For the first time, the differentiation between shape-stabilized and form-stable composite PCM has been made. Moreover, various construction materials such as diatomite, expanded perlite and graphite, etc. which are used as supports for formstable composite PCM along with their worldwide availability are extensively discussed. One of the main aims of this review paper is to focus on the test methods which are used to determine the chemical compatibility, thermal properties, thermal stability and thermal conductivity of the PCM. Hence, the details related to calibration, sample preparation, test cell and analysis of test results are comprehensively covered. Finally, because of the renewed interest in integration of PCM in wallboards and concrete, an up-to-date review with focus on PCM enhanced wallboard and concrete for building applications is added.

Hydrothermal synthesis of CSH-phases (tobermorite) under influence of Ca-formate,Inorganic compounds; Chemical synthesis; Electron microscopy; Infrared spectroscopy; X-ray diffraction,TRICALCIUM SILICATE; CALCIUM FORMATE; REAL STRUCTURE; OD CHARACTER; HYDRATION; 11-ANGSTROM,"The influence of Ca-formate (C2H2CaO4) on the crystallization of the CSH-phase 11 angstrom tobermorite was investigated under hydrothermal conditions at 200 degrees C in a wide CaO/SiO2 range of 0.67-1.24. Besides clarifying questions on acceleration or retarding of CSH formation at high Ca-formate contents even a study on the effect of this salt addition on the crystal morphology was a main objective of the present work. All experiments were performed using fine grained SiO2 powder (P) or coarse grained quartz sand (S) as silicate source. The reactions were followed by XRD, SEM/EDX and FTIR. Except the reaction at lowest amount of formate (0.43 g), where only a very small effect on the crystallization rate was observed, higher salt concentrations were found to retard the reaction clearly. Here the reduction of the CSH-crystallization velocity and formation of tobermorite with a distinct character of the pre-phase CSH-I could be stated in each case. Its amount and crystal quality was not rigorously dependant on the inserted mass of Ca-formate in the 0.67-1.34 g range investigated here. A strong influence on the morphology of the CSH-crystals was further detected already in the whole range of salt concentration, i.e. even at the low value of 0.43g. examined in our experiments. Instead of the typical rod-like morphology of tobermorite formed without Ca-formate, a disturbed bent-needle-like morphology occurred at elevated formate concentrations. In contrast small compact crystals were observed at low amounts of Ca-formate. Syntheses with quartz powder and quartz sand in principle yielded to comparable results concerning the retarding effect and the Change of crystal morphology. As expected, the reaction rate of experiments with quartz sand was diminished in general, according to the lower specific surface of the sand grains, compared with the powder. A change of the pH-value with marked influence on the solubility rate of the educts and the further course of reaction can be excluded as cause for the observed behavior. Further reasons, based on crystal growth under influence of adsorption of formate ions at specific crystal faces were discussed. The improvement of knowledge on effects of additives on CSH crystallization will be of importance for future modifications of reaction processes of cement and concrete as well as steam hardened construction materials, where 11 angstrom tobermorite acts as the main binding agent.

The distribution and orientation of fibres within the concrete matrix plays a major role in the mechanical behaviour of the structural element. Since the observation of those fibres is impossible once the concrete is hardened, new non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques have been developed for its analysis. The application of a magnetic field to the concrete, can lead to check the homogeneity of the material based on the different permeability that provide the fibres according to their distribution and orientation. Based on the mentioned magnetic method, an application oriented correlation is established among these last terms on one hand and the mechanical response of the material on the other. The paper proposes a methodology to infer, non-destructively, the spatial dispersion of mechanical properties throughout the structure. The suitability of the method is assessed comparing the results with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014

With the ever-increasing industrialization and urbanization, huge amounts of natural resources are required to make concrete. This, in turn, means that large volumes of natural resources and raw materials are being used for concrete production around the world. To eliminate or minimize the negative environmental impact of the concrete industry and promote environmental sustainability of the industry, the use of wastes from industry as materials for concrete making is considered as an alternative solution for preventing the excessive usage of raw materials. The wide availability of agricultural wastes make them a suitable and dependable alternative for aggregate in concrete, wherever available. This paper reviews the possible use of agricultural wastes as aggregate in the concrete industry. It aims to promote the idea of using these wastes by elaborating upon their engineering properties. This summary of existing knowledge about the successful use of agricultural wastes in the concrete industry helps to identify other existing waste products for use in concrete making. From this identification by agricultural and civil engineers, significant achievements can be attained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Mechanical and durability properties of concretes containing recycled lime powder and recycled aggregates,Concrete; Recycled waste; Recycled fillers; Recycled aggregates mechanical properties; Durability,SELF-COMPACTING CONCRETE; SORPTIVITY; BEHAVIOR; MORTARS,"According to a recent report by the European Commission, within the European Union, the construction and demolition wastes come to at least 450 million tons per year. Roughly 75% of the waste is disposed to landfill, despite its major recycling potential. The bulk constituents of demolition debris are concrete (50-55%) and masonry (30-40%) with only small percentages of other materials such as metals, glass and timber. In Cyprus, at present, recycling of waste materials is practically inexistent and almost the entire demolition waste products are disposed in landfill sites, with all possible economic, technical and environmental impacts. This research paper presents the evaluation and the effective reuse of waste construction materials, such as recycled lime powder (RLP) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), disposed to landfill sites in Cyprus, due to the lack of a lucid recycling policy and knowledge. Results show that both RLP and RCA have the potential to produce good quality and robust concrete mixtures both in terms of mechanical and durability performance.

After a process of physical, chemical and mineralogical characterization of the raw materials, calcium-silicate samples were manufactured by mixing bottom ash (CF) with different sources of lime (calcium oxide-OC and calcium hydroxide-HC) and Portland cement (CM). The amount of bottom ash added ranged from 10% to 90% of the dry weight of the mixtures. The experimental program included a wide range of testing methods of the developed material such as water absorption, mechanical strength, porosity, microstructure, freeze-thaw and thermal conductivity. The optimal values are those containing a 1:1 ratio of SiO2/CaO, with compressive strength ranging from 25.21 MPa (CF/HC) to 61.11 MPa (CF/CM) and thermal conductivity from 0.564 W/m K (CF/OC) to 0.773 W/m K (CF/HC). The initial results obtained make it possible in principle to obtain calcium-silicate samples with low thermal conductivity according EN standard 771-2:2011. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The hybrid pre-cast composite structural system was utilized in one apartment building. The application propriety and environmental friendliness of hybrid pre-cast composite structural systems were verified by comparison with a flat plate, reinforced concrete Rahmen frame. The hybrid pre-cast composite structural systems presented in this study can be used as a lateral Smart Frame and a gravity Smart Frame. The lateral Smart Frame with moment connections is used for dual systems, in which the moment frames should be able to resist at least 25% of the seismic design forces. Gravity Smart Frames with pin joints for building frame systems are essentially complete space frames providing supports for vertical loads. Seismic force resistance is provided by shear walls. The hybrid pre-cast composite structural system demonstrated its application propriety by its ability to reduce the quantity of construction material. According to the structural design results with hybrid pre-cast composite structural systems, less material was required per unit area compared with the flat plate and reinforced concrete Rahmen frame structures. This structural system can thus reduce CO2 emissions and energy consumption, helping to preserve the environment.",2014
Energy and carbon embodied in straw and clay wall blocks produced locally in the Andean Patagonia,Renewable construction materials; Straw; Embodied energy; Greenhouse gases; Carbon footprint,FLUE SPACE HEATERS; THERMAL EFFICIENCY,"The production and use of cereal straw as a base material to make building envelopes in the Andean Patagonian region have been investigated. Energy used and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in local manufacturing of construction materials for walls based on wheat straw were obtained, as well as cropland required for different construction techniques. Two options for the use of straw to fill envelop walls were investigated: the direct use of straw bales, whether in whole or in halves, and the manufacturing of straw-clay blocks. The former has the best thermal conductivity but requires larger cultivation areas to satisfy wall demands, whilst the latter could be an option including moderate thermal efficiency and better cropland performance. Per wall surface unit, energy use and GHG emissions of all straw options were significantly lower compared to fired bricks or to concrete blocks. Furthermore, all straw options analysed result in significantly better thermal performance than current choices of fired bricks or concrete blocks, which are commonly used in the region. The present results show a relevant role of renewable agricultural products in lowering impacts of building materials, as well as options for sustainable production. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Effect of construction materials on embodied energy and cost of buildings-A case study of residential houses in India up to 60 m(2) of plinth area,Embodied energy (EBE); Energy efficient building materials; GHG; HUDCO; Cost effective house,,"Worldwide buildings consume annually about 30-40% of primary energy in construction, operation and maintenance. An enormous part of this energy is consumed in construction activities alone. Nearly two million residential buildings for economic weaker section alone, are required to be built annually in India, apart from offices, commercial, public and industrial buildings. Use of low embodied energy and cost effective building materials, in the building construction, can significantly reduce the overall energy consumption and thus eventually minimize energy footprint of buildings. In this paper, the embodied energy and construction cost have been estimated for the residential houses (up to four storied) of a chosen typology. The calculation has been done for total 122 nos of houses, having plinth area varying between 20 m(2) and 60 m(2). The embodied energy and construction cost have been compared and analyzed for various building materials (i.e. burnt clay bricks, hollow cement concrete blocks, aerated autoclaved blocks, fly ash lime gypsum blocks, solid cement concrete blocks etc.). It is estimated, that the embodied energy (EBE) is least (2.092 GJ/m(2)) for two storied houses, constructed with hollow cement concrete block based masonry, however cost of building materials is found to be lowest (US$ 62/m(2)) for four storied houses constructed with AAC block based masonry. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Life cycle assessment of a hemp concrete wall: Impact of thickness and coating,Bio-based material; Environmental impact indicators; Carbon uptake; Sprayed hemp concrete; Wood framework,DIFFERENT EUROPEAN LOCATIONS; RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS; WOOD,"In a context of sustainable development and energy sparing, a life cycle assessment (LCA) may be useful to make good choices. Thus, this study concerns the LCA of an environmentally friendly material used for building construction, hemp concrete. The functional unit is first defined per square metre such that the wall may provide the function of bearing wall and its thermal performance is described by a thermal resistance of 2.78 m(2) K/W. The results then showed that the production phase of raw materials is mainly responsible for the environmental impact of the wall, mostly due to the binder production. It was also shown that, compared to traditional construction materials, hemp concrete has a low impact on environment. Moreover, hemp concrete contributes to reduce climate change as photosynthesis-mediated carbon sequestration and carbonation serve to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. A sensitivity analysis is performed on three criteria: wall thickness, renewal of coatings and compounds of the indoor coating. Our results show that environmental indicators evolve with wall thickness, except for the climate change indicator. It improves with thickness due to carbon sequestration and carbonation. Moreover the increase in the wall's thermal resistance with wall thickness is not taken into account in such an LCA performed at the material level. The renewal of coating slightly impacts the environmental indicator for small numbers of renewals but it leads to negative effects if they are too numerous. It appears that hemp-lime coating has a greater impact than sand-lime coating as it embeds more binder. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Assessment of the embodied carbon in precast concrete wall panels using a hybrid life cycle assessment approach in Malaysia,Life-cycle; Embodied energy; Carbon Malaysia,,There is currently growing interest in quantifying the direct and indirect carbon emissions embodied in construction materials and their components production. Previous research shows that indirect emission could be higher than direct emission for energy intensity materials such as cement and steel reinforcement. Quantifying direct emissions alone would underestimate the carbon emissions associated with a material and in turn its environmental impact. The assessment of indirect emissions is a challenging task involving upstream processes of material production. This paper investigates the existing literature on the quantification of embodied carbon by both direct and indirect emissions as well as demonstrating the application of a hybrid life cycle assessment method in building construction. The focus of this paper is the Malaysian context however the principles apply universally. A typical 2-storey residential building has been investigated to determine the total carbon emissions when comparing two construction techniques: conventionally reinforced concrete and precast concrete panels. This paper demonstrates the application of hybrid life cycle assessment by expanding the boundaries of process methods and reducing the sensitivities of I-O life cycle assessment to the raw material price fluctuation for product manufacturing.

"An environmentally friendly thermal insulation material from sunflower stalk, textile waste and stubble fibres",Sunflower stalk; Stubble; Textile waste; Insulation material,SOUND INSULATION; COTTON; ASH; CONCRETE; BRICKS,"Heating costs in the winter and cooling costs in the summer are very high. Building insulation reduces heating costs in the winter and cooling costs in the summer. Although sunflower production in Turkey is significant, after the production the sunflower stem is a serious problem for farmers. Sunflower stems are cleaned, burned or used for temporary heating purposes. This type of use is causing serious problems to the environment. Sunflower stalks and cotton textile waste, such as stubble, cause serious environmental problems. To circumvent this problem, the present study puts forth an advantageous use of those waste materials for insulation of buildings. In Turkey there are a lot of both of the aforementioned materials. As the binder for those two materials epoxy was used. As samples, 30 x 40 x 2.5 cm rectangular blocks were prepared under different pressures. The samples were tested for their mechanical properties and the coefficients of thermal conductivity, as well. The results obtained satisfied the Turkish Standard TS 805 EN 601. Thus, the method proposed in this study solves two industrial problems at the same time. A useful construction material is produced while some waste materials causing environmental problems are warded off. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2014
Recycling steel-manufacturing slag and harbor sediment into construction materials,Calcium silicate; Sediment; Slag; Lightweight aggregate; Construction material,LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; SLUDGE,"Mixtures consisting of harbor sediment and slag waste from steel industry containing toxic components are fired to produce non-hazardous construction materials.

At a sintering temperature of 1050 degrees C, the fired pellets are in a form of brick-like product, while at 1100 degrees C, they become lightweight aggregates. Calcium silicate, kyanite, and cristobalite are newly formed in the pellets after firing, demonstrating that calcium oxide acts as a flux component and chemically reacted with Si- and/or Al-containing components to promote sintering. Dioxin/furan content present in the pure slag is 0.003 ng I-TEQg(-1) and, for the fired pellet consisting of slag and sediment, the content appears to be destructed and diminishes to 0.0003 ng I-TEQg(-1) after 950 degrees C-firing; while it is 0.002 ng I-TEQg(-1) after firing at 1100 degrees C, suggesting that dioxins/furans in the 950 degrees C-fired pellets have a greater chance to escape to atmosphere due to a slower sintering reaction and/or that construction of dioxins/furans from molten chloride salts co-exists with their destruction. Multiple toxicity characteristic leaching procedure extracts Cu, Cr, Zn, Se, Cd, Pb, Ba, As, and Hg from all fired products at negligible levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2014
Toward a microscopic understanding of the calcium-silicate-hydrates/water interface,Calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H); Formation; pH; Stability,ORGANOPHOSPHONIC ACID MONOLAYERS; CRYSTALLINE SILICON; ALKALINE-SOLUTIONS; COVERED ALUMINUM; SURFACES; ADSORPTION; FUNCTIONALIZATION; ACTIVATION; STABILITY; CHEMISTRY,"Calcium-Silicate-Hydrates (C-S-H) are the main binding phases in most concrete which is the primarily used composite construction material in the world. However, a big lack is cleaving between the actual knowledge about C-S-H, compared to what could be reached using state-of-the-art technologies of modern research. In this article, the formation of a C-S-H phase on a native oxide covered silicon wafer is investigated by means of in-situ attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) and ex-situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). The total thickness of the C-S-H phase is determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to be 3 nm. The formation appears to be reversible depending on the environment pH value and can be performed at room temperature. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is shown that the C-S-H phase in the presence of water will change its chemical composition in order to reach the thermodynamic ground state of the system. This change is achieved by a metal-proton exchange reaction. The stoichiometry of these metal-proton exchange reactions is nearly independent of the environment pH value. Electrokinetic measurements yield isoelectric points of 2.0 and 2.6 for the native oxide covered silicon wafer (SiO2) and the C-S-H phase. This is consistent with a predominance of Si-O sites at the C-S-H/water interface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.",2014
Manufacture of a construction material using the physicochemical properties of ash and sludge wastes from MDF board production,Industrial waste; Recycling; MDF industry; Construction materials,WOOD; CONCRETE,"The need to reduce and recycle industrial wastes is increasing apace due to the rising cost of water and of effluent disposal, and the need for compliance with environmental legislation. The purpose of this work was to study the use of sludge derived from the physicochemical treatment involved in the MDF board production process, and to take advantage of the physicochemical properties of ash, sludge and lime production wastes for the manufacture of a new product with improved characteristics for use in civil construction. To this end, samples were prepared with different combinations of the aforementioned wastes and their mechanical, chemical and mineralogical properties were tested and analyzed to obtain a product with optimal characteristics and mechanical strength. The results indicate that a waste content of 30-45% in weight provides good levels of mechanical strength, making these products suitable for application as construction materials. Moreover, the use of these industrial wastes is economically attractive in view of their low cost, and highly beneficial to the environment because it eliminates or at least reduces their incorrect disposal.

Cost optimization of reinforced high strength concrete T-sections in flexure,cost optimization; high strength concrete (HSC) T-sections; ultimate limit state (ULS); eurocode2 (EC-2); nonlinear programming; conjugate gradient algorithm,OPTIMUM DESIGN; BEAMS,"This paper reports on the development of a minimum cost design model and its application for obtaining economic designs for reinforced High Strength Concrete (HSC) T-sections in bending under ultimate limit state conditions. Cost objective functions, behavior constraint including material nonlinearities of steel and HSC, conditions on strain compatibility in steel and concrete and geometric design variable constraints are derived and implemented within the Conjugate Gradient optimization algorithm. Particular attention is paid to problem formulation, solution behavior and economic considerations. A typical example problem is considered to illustrate the applicability of the minimum cost design model and solution methodology. Results are confronted to design solutions derived from conventional design office methods to evaluate the performance of the cost model and its sensitivity to a wide range of unit cost ratios of construction materials and various classes of HSC described in Eurocode2. It is shown, among others that optimal solutions achieved using the present approach can lead to substantial savings in the amount of construction materials to be used. In addition, the proposed approach is practically simple, reliable and computationally effective compared to standard design procedures used in current engineering practice.",2014

The quality and the durability of the concrete structures are affected a lot by the degradation processes. Reinforced concrete is considered as a versatile, economical and successful construction material. Usually it is durable and resistant material, performing well throughout its service life. The corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete, due to invasive environment, is the phenomenon that highly affects the reliability and durability of reinforced concrete structures.

Digital Fabrication Technology in Concrete Architecture,Digital Fabrication; Concrete; CAM; Robotics; Sustainability,,"Technological innovation has been an important driving force in architecture, enabling and inspiring architects and engineers by giving them new tools for solving existing problems. In the last two decades, the exploration of digital design and fabrication technologies has stimulated the development of a variety of interests and strategies to materialize increasingly complex and customized solutions in architecture, with traditional building materials. Reinforced concrete is the most widely used material in the building industry today and throughout its history has been the subject of vast research into its performance as a construction material and its tectonic potential in architecture. As such, the introduction of digital fabrication processes in concrete construction represents the biggest prospect for renovation of our built environment and at the same time, presents particular difficulties and opportunities, which are now being addressed. In an effort to investigate the alternative design and material possibilities in concrete emerging from the use of digital fabrication technologies in architecture, this paper proposes a focused view of digital fabrication applied to concrete construction with two areas of research. By framing the research in the context of reference works in concrete architecture of the 20th century, this paper describes and illustrates taxonomy of existing and possible types of integration of digital fabrication technologies in concrete architecture in the realms of Practice and Research. This characterization allows the authors to frame the relation between material, technology and architecture in different environments regarding the same material, extracting a clear image of existing processes, their potential and shortcomings, as well as expectations for future developments.",2014
IMPLICATION OF MICROSTRUCTURE AND DURABILITY MEASURES FOR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF ALKALI-ACTIVATED CONCRETES,Alkali-activation; Slag; Fly ash; Durability; Standards; Commercialisation,PHASE EVOLUTION; FLY-ASH; SLAG; TECHNOLOGY,"Alkali-activated concrete (AAC) has been commercialised in Australia as a low-CO2 construction material. The adoption of AAC faces several challenges, including lack of recognition in standards, lack of a dedicated supply chain, lack of a long service track record, and the question whether laboratory durability testing gives a reliable prediction of service life. By using cutting edge analysis of microstructure as a predictor of durability, research plays a key role in the commercialisation of AAC. This paper outlines how AAC can be recognised in standards using knowledge of microstructure and a performance-based approach independent of binder chemistry. The mechanical strength development, water permeability and chloride migration of two AACs (100wt.% slag and 50wt.% slag/50wt.% fly ash) compared to OPC concrete are presented, with mix designs tailored to give comparable 28-day strengths of 50 +/- 3 MPa. AAC exhibited many technical benefits over OPC concrete, such as higher strength and decreased chloride ion penetration. AAC is shown to meet the requirements of the equivalent performance concept and this provides an argument for scale-up, regulatory acceptance and wider market adoption.",2014
Field Test on Stiffened Deep Mixed Columns,Stiffened deep mixed (SDM) column; Plate loading test; Core pile; Bearing capacity,,"A composite column, referred to as Stiffened Deep Mixed (SDM) column, can be used to improve the soft soils. It consists of a Deep Mixed (DM) column inserted by a small-sized precast concrete pile (called core pile as well) in center. The past study (citation) shows that the SDM column can provide high bearing capacity as compared with the pile with the same material of the core pile and same configuration of the SDM column under the same geological conditions. Therefore, the technique of SDM columns has a significant effect on saving construction material and budget. The previous projects indicate that the SDM column can reduce 20-40 % of budget at least. However, its mechanical behaviors have not been well understood yet. To investigate the mechanical behaviors of SDM column, a series of plate loading tests including nine Prestressed High Strength Concrete (PHC) piles and 30 SDM columns in total are conducted in field. Axial strains of two columns are measured during tests by the Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) Sensor Technology. The axial force distributions of the core piles can be obtained based on the axial strains. The test results show the bearing capacity of SDM column is extremely high and the side resistant ratio between SDM columns and PHC piles is approximately in a range from 1.3 to 2.5.",2014
IN EARTH WE TRUST: REINTRODUCTION OF RAMMED EARTH,Rammed Earth; Sustainability design,,"With concrete being the most widely used material on earth, with over two tonnes per person being used annually, and most forms of thermal insulation sourced or prepared by fossil fuels, the building construction market provides significant potential for reducing consumption with cost-effective and sustainable measures. Naturally all building criteria regarding structural integrity, thermal technical requirements and hygiene should be met for the solution to be attractive. Considering the changes in many construction laws and EU norms towards sustainability and the reduction of construction materials environmental burdens, the objective of this paper is to increase the understanding of rammed earth as a ""natural"" construction material so that structures built from rammed earth can be better analysed and implemented in green building design in Europe. This work was produced due to the lack of engineering knowledge currently available and the lack of understanding of the fundamental processes of ecological sustainable rammed earth design. Using local data from several rammed earth experiments focused on material properties including climate chamber measurements this article points out the environmental friendliness and sustainability of rammed earth construction and also provides guidelines for basic cost benefit analysis, formwork, construction sequence, quality control, moisture content, finishes, strength and thermal properties.",2014
MODERN ARECHITECTURE THROUGH LOCAL FORMS AND MATERIALS,sustainable architecture; alternative construction materials,,"This article is meant to provide a brief overview of the recently emerging trend in sustainable architecture - the using of locally available, often unprocessed materials to construct fully functioning, modern residential architecture. From the use of garbage as filler in concrete, to structures made of compressed earth found on-site that are not only pleasing to the eye, but also offer high quality insulation properties, architects and engineers are rediscovering seemingly primitive materials and design solutions and put them to use in some of the most modern buildings. Materials such as compressed earth, cob and cordwood are easy to obtain, are fully degradable with no negative impact on the environment, and while it is labor intensive to build structures out of them, it is also very simple, allowing the overall cost of construction to be lower than when compared with the typically used structural materials of today. Recently, these materials have started to gain popularity among proponents of zero-energy and green or natural building, who use them to great effect in terms of innovative architectural design. The use of these materials can help our society become more friendly to the environment, having an argument in its favor that has, time and again, proven that it can cause shifts in the development of civilizations comparable to the switch from bronze to iron - they are simply cheaper.",2014
THE CAPABILITIES OF USING CONCRETE IN SUSTAINABLE ARCHITECTURE,sustainable architecture; concrete; precasting; carbon footprint; energy efficient design,,"Contemporary building materials manufacturers compete with each other in searching for a new concrete mixtures to increase the attractiveness of this material at all levels. Success can be seen in terms of life span of the products, appearance and structural strength. In the past few years, concrete has also gained a reputation as one of the most environment friendly building materials. It is difficult to decide how much of this is due to efficient marketing efforts of the manufacturers but there is no doubt, that it has many beneficial effects on energy management of the building and intensively developed new technologies have greatly expanded its range of use. The author of this article describes the main advantages of concrete as a material that participates in reducing the carbon footprint in the process of construction and exploitation of an architectural object. The studies is based on completed buildings in different regions of the world where the concrete was used as the basic structural and finishing material. As it turns out some of the popular devices installed in order to save energy seems to be unnecessary and easy to replaced by using in a conscious way one of the most popular construction materials. Conducted by the author studies lead to the conclusion that there is no such thing as energy-efficient material. Only the way it is used can make it energy-saving. Conscious and skillful use of its wide range of properties can help to minimize the negative environmental impact of buildings.",2014
Microstructure and durability characteristics of self-curing concrete,Self-curing concrete; water-soluble polymers; moist-curing; periodic curing; microstructure; durability; RCPT; water permeability,WATER-RETENTION; CURE CONCRETE,"Efficient curing of concrete requires high water demand which is not available in many practical situations. Therefore, the need of self-curing concrete becomes more demanding. In this study, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and polyacrylamide (PAM) have been used as water soluble polymers to develop self-curing concrete. The main microstructural and durability characteristics of the developed self-curing concrete mixture were examined and compared to those of conventional concrete mixtures with no self-curing agents under different curing regimes. One batch of the self-curing and the conventional mixtures were left in the lab air-cured to act as non-water-cured control samples. The water curing regimes for conventional mixture included continuous moist-curing (waterimmersion) for 3, 7 and 28 days and periodical moist-curing by means of wetted burlaps for 3 and 7 days. Curing regimes for the self-curing mixtures included 3 days of moist-curing and periodical curing using wetted burlaps for 3 and 7 days. The microstructure characteristics of the concrete mixtures were investigated by a scanning electron microscope. The durability performance of the concrete mixtures was evaluated by measuring the rapid chloride permeability and water permeability. Self-curing concrete mixtures showed better microstructure development and durability performance than those of the air-cured conventional concrete mixtures. A short 3 days moist-curing significantly improved the performance of the self-curing concrete mixture to a level almost similar to that of the conventional concrete mixture that was water-immersed for 28 days. Self-curing concrete represents a step towards a new construction material due to its lower water demand needed for curing, and hence can reserve the limited water resources in many parts in the world.",2014
Cementless concrete using ceramic waste powder,Ceramic powder; geopolymer; sodium hydroxide activator; compressive strength; water absorption; electrical resistivity; microstructure,ALKALI-ACTIVATED BINDERS; FLY-ASH GEOPOLYMER; TECHNOLOGY; BEHAVIOR,"Concrete is the main construction material worldwide. The cement production is well known to significantly contribute to the world carbon dioxide emission, around 7% of the global green-house gas produced annually. Worldwide the replacement of cement by supplementary cementing materials has been used as a step to reduce the consumption of cement quantities in concrete mixtures. Geopolymer concrete represents a new alternative in making concrete by utilizing materials mainly composed of silica and alumina which could be alkali-activated to form a CaO-free alumino-silicate binder. Different materials were used in producing geopolymer concrete such as fly ash, metakaolin and slag. The ceramic industry produces significant amount of ceramic waste powder. The ceramic waste powder is characterized by its high percentage of silica (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3), which is more than 70%. It represents a potential material to be utilized in making geopolymer concrete. In this study, ceramic waste powder was used in a preliminary investigation to produce geopolymer concrete. The study investigated the effect of using sodium hydroxide as alkali activation solution, the pH concentration of the alkali solution (i. e. 8M, 10M, 12M, 14M and 16M) and applying curing temperature of 60 degrees C. Compressive strength, water absorption, electrical resistivity and microstructure of the produced geopolymer were investigated. Preliminary results showed that ceramic waste powder represents a very good potential to be used in producing cementless concrete.",2014
Response modelling of recycled concrete and masonry in pavements,Construction demolition waste; pavement materials; monotonic tests; resilient modulus tests,,"An increasing need for sustainable development has made recycling a priority in many countries. In South Africa, due to rapid urbanisation, millions of tons of construction and demolition waste (CDW) are generated and significant percentages end up in landfills. Many international studies have shown that CDW (in this context consisting of a mixture of concrete and masonry rubble) could be a viable road construction material within the structural layers of the pavement. In this research, a laboratory experimental program was developed to assess the physical and mechanical behavior of CDW. Through monotonic and dynamic testing the shear strength and resilient response was tested. Experimental variables such as mix composition (ratio of concrete to masonry), mixing and compaction moisture and degree of compaction with regard to its Maximum Dry Density (MDD) were evaluated. The laboratory results revealed that the failure behaviour, i.e the shear strength showed to be dependent on composition and degree of compaction but less on the compaction moisture. Moreover, the stress history significantly affected the shear behaviour of CDW as indicated by the difference in the obtained results for the shear parameters on ""virgin"" samples and samples preloaded by cyclic loading through resilient modulus testing. In addition, the material composition and compaction moisture were found to have a relative distinctive effect on the resilient response.",2014
On-site concrete waste minimization in the UK,On-site; concrete waste minimization; construction industry,,"Over 1 billion tonnes of construction and demolition waste (C&DW) is generated every year worldwide. According to the Government's Waste Strategy for England, Construction industry is one of the biggest sources of waste in England. The construction, demolition and excavation (CD&E) sector generates more waste than any other sector in England, and it is the largest generator of hazardous waste, approximately 1.7 million tonnes, considering, the sector accounts for 9 to 10% of GDP (Gross Domestic Product). Concrete has been verified to be a leading construction material for more than a century. The production of concrete in the world has been estimated at an annual rate of 1 m3 (approximately 2.5 tones) per capita. The Focus of this paper is in the particular area of concrete, to identify and illustrate the current methods and practices of onsite concrete waste minimizing in construction industry in the UK (United Kingdom). After literature reviews and researches in current and previous studies in waste minimization, a list of possible methods have been prepared.

Reducing CO2 in concrete by half,Cement; OPC; reducing CO2; concrete,,"Concrete is the main construction material in the world with over 9 billion m(3)/year being produced. That leads to a CO2 emission of over 5 billion tons of CO2/year, whereby more than half is caused by the OPC (Ordinary Portland Cement). It is expected that the concrete use will rise until 2050, an increase of 260%, that means the CO2 emission will increase with the same percentage to 13 billion tons CO2. To reduce the immense CO2 emission, it is necessary to use other binders than only OPC, for instance Supplementary Cementing Materials (SCM) and Non-Portland Cement (NPC). But it is also possible to make real bio-cement out of biomass, so bio-cement can be grown. The authors did some pilot projects, of using only 85 kg cement/m(3) concrete, instead of the normal used 330-260 kg cement/m3 concrete. That means the CO2 emissions can be reduced by half already, in the present time. In the future, it will be possible to reduce it still more and that will be necessary for our world.",2014
"Analysis of Micro-Morphology, Thermal Conductivity, Thermal Diffusivity and Specific Heat Capacity of Coconut Fibre Reinforced Foamed Concrete",,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPOSITES,"With the quest for green construction and affordable housing systems for both rural and urban populations in Malaysia, various proposals focusing on cutting down on conventional building material costs have been put forward. One vanguard suggestion has been the sourcing, development and use of alternative, non-conventional local construction materials including the prospect of using some agricultural wastes as construction materials. This research describes experimental studies on the use of coconut coir fibre as an enhancer of foamed concrete with a focus on 2 parameters which are morphology properties and thermal properties of different percentages of coconut fibre (0%, 0.2% and 0.4%). In this study the addition of coconut fibre significantly improved all the properties investigated. The results of the tests showed that the thermal properties of foamed concrete improved with an increase in the proportion of coconut fibre. Findings from this research will also be used to address the knowledge gap on the subject of foamed concrete and will provide an improved understanding and raised awareness of the potential for using waste materials for domestic construction.",2014
Investigation of Mechanical Properties of Coconut Fiber as a Concrete Admixture,,,"The high cost of conventional construction materials is the dominating factor affecting housing systems worldwide. Because of this, further research into alternative materials in construction is required. The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the physical characteristics and mechanical properties of concrete produced using shredded coconut fibre composites. The following percentage amounts of fibre were tested: 0% (control), 0.6%, and 1.8%. The coconut fibres were cut to a certain length according to previous studies which suggested that the most ideal length is around 30 - 60mm. The test results showed that the compressive strength of concrete decreased as the percentage of total fibre in the concrete mix increased. The experimental results also showed that coconut fibre concrete performed satisfactorily in terms of crack growth in comparison to that of conventional concrete. Finally, it was concluded that the use of coconut fibres has great potential in the production of lightweight concrete or normal concrete for use in the construction of concrete structures. As coconut fibre is a natural material that is easily available and cheap, it is a particularly good, low-cost alternative. Therefore, this material has the potential to overcome the problem of escalating costs in the industry.",2014
Concrete Waste as a Cement Replacement Material in Concrete Blocks for Optimization of Thermal and Mechanical Properties,,BUILDING-BLOCKS,"The sustainability of the natural environment and eco-systems is of great importance. Waste generated from construction forces mankind to find new dumping grounds and at the same time, more natural resources are required for use as construction materials. In order to overcome this problem, this study was conducted to investigate the use of concrete waste in concrete blocks with a special focus on the thermal and mechanical properties of the resulting products. Three varieties of concrete mixtures were prepared, whereby they each contained different amounts of concrete waste of 0%, 5% and 15%, respectively. These mixtures were formed into cube specimens and were then analysed for data on their compressive strength, density and ultrasonic pulse. Thermal investigations were carried out on each admixture as well as on a control concrete block of model design. The thermal data results indicated that the 15% concrete waste mixture had the lowest temperature in comparison to the surrounding air. For density and compressive strength, the highest readings came from the control mixture at 2390 kg/m(3) and 40.69 N/mm(2), respectively, at 28 days. In terms of pulse velocity, the 5% concrete waste mixture indicated medium quality results of 4016 m/s.",2014
Characterization of unsaturated properties of recycled materials,,WATER CHARACTERISTIC CURVE; SHEAR-STRENGTH; SOILS,"Substantial amounts of waste from industry and construction are produced every day around the world. Much of the wastes consist of concrete aggregate, asphalt shingle, steel slag and copper slag which can be reused as construction materials. Many studies have been carried out to investigate the characteristics of recycled materials under saturated conditions. However, only few studies have been performed to investigate the Water-Characteristic Curve (WCC), permeability and shear strength of these recycled materials under unsaturated conditions. In addition, the use of these recycled materials as construction materials using the principles of unsaturated soil mechanics has not been fully studied. Therefore, this paper focuses on the unsaturated properties, i.e. the drying and wetting WCCs and permeability function of Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA), Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP), Steel Slag (SS), Copper Slag (CS) as well as the unsaturated shear strength of RCA and RAP. In addition, the application of RCA and RAP in Capillary Barrier System (CBS) as a slope cover system is also presented. The experimental results indicated that RCA, RAP, SS and CS have similar characteristics with natural aggregates under saturated and unsaturated conditions. The RCA, RAP, SS and CS with smaller particle sizes, have higher air-entry value, higher water-entry value and lower permeability as compared to those with larger particle sizes. The shear strengths of the RCA and RAP exhibit non-linear behavior with respect to net normal stress. Therefore, nonlinear shear strength equations are used to model the shear strength of the RCA and RAP. The experimental results also showed that the RCA and RAP with smaller particles sizes have lower values of phi' and phi(b) as compared to those of the coarser RCA and RAP. The results of the numerical analyses also showed that CBS with RCA and RAP is effective in reducing the rainwater infiltration and maintaining the stability of slope, indicating that the RCA and RAP can be used to replace natural aggregates within CBS.",2014

This composite breathes, as well as having good thermal and acoustic-insulation properties. The paper provides an overview of international literature and its relevance to New Zealand (where hempcrete has already been used) and the Czech Republic (where the first hempcrete house is under construction). A life cycle analysis of hempcrete will be used to examine its ecological footprint, especially in reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

IMPULSE RESPONSE TECHNIQUE- A VALUABLE NON-DESTRUCTIVE METHOD TO DETECT FLAWS,,,"Impulse Response (IR) is a nondestructive testing technique in which ""mobility"" of the structural member under investigation is determined. Mobility is a complex ratio of particle velocity and the applied force. The test involves striking the surface of the structure with an instrumented hammer and measuring vibration response of the member. The time-domain data of the instrumented hammer (applied force) and the vibration sensor are collected and transformed into the frequency domain by the signal analyzer. The mobility of the member is obtained by calculating the transfer function of particle velocity and the applied force. The value of the mobility can be used to assess the condition of the member on a comparative basis. Tests can be performed on a variety of construction materials such as concrete, masonry, ceramic, thin steel or aluminum plates. The method has been successfully used to determine slab-on-grade support conditions, delaminations, voids, existence of grout under the machinery base plates or in concrete blocks or clay bricks. This paper presents a description and the equipment used in the method. In addition, case studies will be presented to show how the method was applied to document the internal conditions.",2014
Comparative Analysis of the Thermal Behavior between Cellular Concrete Blocks and Stabilized Earth Blocks as Wall Materials,Thermography; thermal behavior; construction material,,"In extreme climates like the desert climate of Northwest Mexico; indoor thermal conditions in buildings; and particularly in low-cost housing developments, are very uncomfortable. In buildings where the use of air conditioning devices can be afford, excessive energy is spent, leading to high acclimatization costs. In many cases, construction materials for low-cost houses are selected according to the lowest price, and not taking into account the best thermal behavior according to the local climate. Different types of blocks are widely used as a construction material for walls, such us earth blocks, adobe, concrete hollow blocks, cellular blocks, bricks, because of their low price and easy installation. Design strategies must be very carefully selected according to the local climate, because they have a great impact on energy consumptions and in the quality of life of the occupants. The selection of the appropriate materials for the envelope is part of these design strategies, and is the main subject of this paper. In this work we analyze the thermal behavior of a wall compound of two different materials: cellular concrete blocks and stabilized earth blocks. The monitored wall is part of a low-cost house constructed for demonstrative and experimental purposes. External and internal superficial temperatures have been measured and infrared images of the same areas have been analyzed. Infrared thermography is particularly useful to evaluate ion-homogeneous materials or non-traditional materials, from which not all thermal properties are known. The thermal behavior is analyzed, in relation to the expected characteristics according to the climate, such as adequate thermal insulation and thermal inertia of the envelope, which are different for air-conditioning and non air-conditioning situations.

Experimental Investigation on Flexural Performance of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete Slab,Flexural Performance; Cladding Panel; Autoclaved Aerated Concrete,,With the bending experiment of 9 JINYU reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete slabs the objective of the research was to characterize the flexural performance of cladding panel such as deflections and extent of cracking that the elements would undergo under uniform load and finally recommended a suggestion for further analysis. To know more about such non-conventional materials two-point loads were applied to all the specimens and were monotonically increased until failure analyzing how the span affected the flexural behavior. Besides a theoretical analysis was conducted to predict the strength of the AAC panel and the analysis result was in good agreement with the experimental value. Through the experimental analysis it can be seen that AAC panel has the potential to be an excellently energy-saving construction material and is believed to emerge as an alternative to traditional reinforced concrete slab in the near future.,2014

These materials offer technical properties comparable to those of Portland cement, but with a much lower CO2 footprint and with the potential for performance advantages over traditional cements in certain niche applications. This review discusses the synthesis of alkali-activated binders from blast furnace slag, calcined clay (metakaolin), and fly ash, including analysis of the chemical reaction mechanisms and binder phase assemblages that control the early-age and hardened properties of these materials, in particular initial setting and long-term durability.

RILEM (International union of laboratories and experts in construction materials, systems and structures) recommendations provide two alternatives for evaluating frost damage by nondestructive evaluation methods for concrete like materials. The first method is based on the ultrasonic pulse velocity measurement, while the second alternative technique is based on the resonant vibration test. In this study, we monitor the frost damage in Portland cement mortar samples with water to cement ratio of 0.5 and aggregate to cement ratio of 3. The samples are completely saturated by water and are frozen for 24 hours at -25 degrees C. The frost damage is monitored after 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 freezing-thawing cycles by nonlinear impact resonance acoustic spectroscopy (NIRAS). The results obtained are compared with those obtained by resonant vibration tests, the second alternative technique recommended by RILEM. The obtained results show that NIRAS is more sensitive to early stages of damage than the standard resonant vibration tests.",2014
Gypsum as reinforcement for floors: Conceptual approach,,,"Traditional floors in the Eastern half of Spain are mainly jack arch floors built with timber joists and poured gypsum. In recent times, ignorance regarding this type of floors has led to the restoration, consolidation and structural reinforcement of these floors with systems and constructive materials like reinforced concrete that have turned out to be incompatible with gypsum. For this reason and thanks to the research project ""Structural consolidation of traditional floors with a compression layer of gypsum with vegetal fibres"" (PAID-05-11/2893), financed by the Universitat Politecnica of Valencia, several essays on the structural consolidation of these traditional floors have been made, with gypsum as the main construction material. This article presents the methodology used in the research, the strategy implemented in the reinforcements, the preliminary results obtained during these experiences and the possibilities of using traditional gypsum as sustainable construction material both in contemporary architecture and historical restoration.",2014
Fabric-formed concrete: A novel method for forming concrete structures,,,"Concrete members have traditionally been cast using a rigid formwork. However, casting concrete in a flexible formwork may in fact be used nearly anywhere a rigid formwork is used and is beginning to attract attention as a method of construction. Straightforward methods of analysis and design are available for the traditionally cast concrete member - be it a concrete floor, beam, wall or column member. This is not the case for the concrete member cast in a flexible fabric formwork. This paper provides a state-of-the-art update on the use of fabric as a formwork for concrete construction and introduces an analytical modeling and design technique that will offer the design community, architects and engineers, 1) an alternative method for expressing themselves using flexible fabric formwork 2) the ability to optimize concrete members and 3) realize economies of construction leading to a conservation of construction materials and a greener more sustainable planet.",2014
Eco-Building Material of Styrofoam Waste and Sugar Industry Fly-ash Based on Nano-Technology,eco-building material; industrial waste; nano-technology concepts,,"Construction world is either directly or indirectly contributed to the environmental degradation that has resulted in global warming and climate change [1]. One of the examples is the use of cement in the construction of which has been accounted for the second largest CO2 emissions after electricity generation, which is around about 930 million tons/year or approximately 7% of the total CO2 emissions (data of Inter-Governmental Panel on climate Change/IPCC) [2]. In addressing this issue, the application of the sustainable development concept that is now known as green construction has been done with concrete constituent materials modification. Another issue about the rising price of oil has resulted in the construction material products including material such as clay bricks and a number of other construction materials. Therefore, research on Green-material products will meet the challenges of economical and environmental aspects. Industrial waste of Styrofoam is used in this study to generate concrete with a light weight and has a good resistance against seepage. While the use of fly ash in this study is intended as a cement substitute material, the use of cement in the concrete mix can be reduced. The use of fly ash from sugar mills Trangkil-Pati, Central Java, Indonesia in previous research is a proof to increase the compressive strength of lightweight concrete produced because it is similar to fly ash [3]. Then, the concept of Nano-technology development will improve the quality of foam-brick performance. (C) 2014 Erni Setyowati. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2014
Recent Trends in Reinforcement Corrosion Assessment Using Piezo Sensors via Electro Mechanical Impedance Technique,Corrosion; EMI technique; Piezo sensor; Rebars; concrete; Equivalent parameters; Corrosion rate; Carbonation,TRANSDUCERS,"Reinforced concrete (RC) is an economical, versatile and successful construction material as it can be moulded into a variety of shapes and finishes. In most cases, it is durable and strong, performing well throughout its service life. However, in some cases, it does not perform adequately due to various reasons, one of which is the corrosion of the embedded steel bars used as reinforcement.. Although the electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique is well established for damage detection and quantification of civil, mechanical and aerospace structures, only limited studies have been reported of its application for rebar corrosion detection in RC structures. This paper presents the recent trends in corrosion assessment based on the model derived from the equivalent structural parameters extracted from the impedance spectrum of concrete-rebar system using the lead zirconate titanate (PZT) sensors via EMI technique.",2014
Mixed experimental/numerical methods applied for concrete parameters estimation,,MODEL,Mixed numerical/experimental method is one of the most widely used for solving difficult practical inverse problems of great industrial significance. Here the mechanical characterization of concrete as one of the most popular construction material is presented. Through a typical uniaxial test of cubic concrete specimen enhanced by in-plane contactless displacement measurements the full set of material constants in typical elasto-plastic constitutive models can be estimated. The great benefit of proposed identification technique is reduction in number of required experimental efforts to just a single test. Such approach provides economical and robust inverse procedure which can be easily conducted in typical testing laboratory.,2014
Development of a geographical information system for risk mapping of reinforced concrete buildings subjected to atmospheric corrosion in Cyprus using optical remote sensing data,GIS; risk area; steel corrosion; reinforced concrete; optical remote sensing; Landsat; classification; non-destructive testing; simplified damage index,STEEL; REBARS,"Concrete reinforced with steel rebars remains one of the most widely used construction materials. Despite its excellent mechanical performance and expected service life of at least 50 years, reinforced concrete is subjected to corrosion of the steel rebars which normally leads to concrete spalling, deterioration of the reinforced concrete's (RC) mechanical properties and eventual reduction of the structural load capacity. In Cyprus, especially in coastal regions where almost 60% of the population resides, many structural problems have been identified in RC structures, which are mainly caused by the severe corrosion of steel rebars. Most RC buildings, located in coastal areas, show signs of corrosion within the first 15-20 years of their service life and this affects their structural integrity and reliability, especially against seismic loading. This paper presents the research undertaken as part of the STEELCOR project which aims to extensively evaluate the steel corrosion of RC buildings in coastal areas of Cyprus and conduct a risk assessment relating to steel corrosion. Non-destructive testing of corroded RC structures measurements were used to estimate the simplified index of structural damage. These indices were imported into a Geographical Information System to develop a digital structural integrity map of Cyprus which would show the areas with high risk of steel corrosion of RC buildings. In addition, archive optical remote sensing dataset was used to map the urban expansion footprint during the last 30 years in Cyprus with the aim of undertaking corrosion risk scenarios by utilizing the estimated indices.",9229
Nondestructive Estimation of Depth of Surface Opening Cracks in Concrete Beams,Diffuse Ultrasonics; Cracking; Impact-Echo,STRESS WAVES,"Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials and thus assessment of damage in concrete structures is of the utmost importance from both a safety point of view and a financial point of view. Of particular interest are surface opening cracks that extend through the concrete cover, as this can expose the steel reinforcement bars underneath and induce corrosion in them. This corrosion can lead to significant subsequent damage in concrete such as cracking and delamination of the cover concrete as well as rust staining on the surface of concrete. Concrete beams are designed and constructed in such a way to provide crack depths up to around 13 cm. Two different types of measurements are made in-situ to estimate depths of real surface cracks (as opposed to saw-cut notches) after unloading: one based on the impact-echo method and the other one based on the diffuse ultrasonic method. These measurements are compared to the crack depth visually observed on the sides of the beams. Discussions are given as to the advantages and disadvantages of each method.",2014
Investigation into the Effect of the Duration of Exposure on the Behaviour of GPC at Elevated Temperatures,,GEOPOLYMERS,"Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) Concrete has long been used in the construction industry as a primary material owing to its versatility, superior performance, low cost, easy workability and availability of accepted standards of practice. The readily available raw materials for the manufacture of cement, and subsequently for concrete itself, have been a driving force for the acceptance of concrete as a construction material worldwide. Recently however, OPC concrete has come under scrutiny over its large carbon footprint. This is largely due to the energy intensive manufacturing process of cement and the extensive use of virgin material in cement production. Focus is therefore shifting to engineer new construction materials that offer similar advantages to that of OPC concrete while being environmentally friendly. Geopolymer Concrete (GPC) is such a material. It has emerged during the last decades, and has been found to possess excellent engineering properties as well as enormous benefits on the sustainability front. The current study is conducted to investigate the compressive strength of GPC up to temperatures of 1000 degrees C for varying duration of exposure time. It was found that when tested at temperatures of 600 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, the GPC samples exhibited a higher compressive strength (8-18%). However, the samples tested after cooling recorded a residual compressive strength 25-50% lower than the ambient strength. Yet, the residual strength of GPC is significantly higher than that of OPC. The duration of exposure time was found to have an insignificant effect on the strength properties of GPC, especially at higher temperatures. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to reveal the changes to the micro-structure that took place after exposure to high temperatures and to get a useful insight into the behaviour of geopolymers.",2014
Use of metallic fibers in concretes,,,"The addition of a waste (fibers) in construction materials, particularly, the concretes is a technique increasingly used, for several reasons, either ecological, or economic, or to improve some properties in a fresh or hardened state. In our work we studied the behavior of the concrete and the mortar containing metallic fibers resulting from the unit BCR which is in Bordj-Menaiel in Algeria (metallic fibers resulting from the rejection at the end of the domestic operation of silvering of the tools and which is stored in plastic bags which are preserved in metal containers). Our work consists to study the behavior of the concretes and the mortars containing these fibers of cement substitution. We noted that the use of these fibers in the concretes in substitution of cement decreases its of compressive strength and flexural strength but to 10% of waste these strength remain acceptable.",2014

In addition, comparisons between the costs of CW facilities based on various alternative construction materials, i.e., reinforced concrete and earth structures (covered with either high density polyethylene or clay), are presented in relation to the required area. The results show that earth structures are economically advantageous. The derived equations can be used for providing a preliminary cost estimate of CW facilities for domestic wastewater treatment.",2014

Analysis and strengthening of superstructure diseases of concrete bridges in China,,,"In this paper, the main types of the superstructure of concrete bridges in China are summarized. It is pointed out that the main defects in the superstructure of concrete bridges in China are penetration of chloride ion, corrosion of steel bar, overlarge deformation, and cracking of main beams or box girders. Based on the various defects existing in different types of bridge superstructures, the causes and mechanisms of these defects are analyzed from the view of design, construction, material, and service conditions. The relevant maintenance and strengthening countermeasures are put forward, such as crack grouting, shotcreting reinforcement, pasting steel reinforcement plates on surface of beam and box girder, pasting carbon fiber or other fiber materials, increasing the cross section of beam and box girder, adding external prestressed tendons, changing the structural system, adding main girders or strengthening lateral connection among main girders, and other strengthening methods.

Three-dimensional network modelling of the influence of microstructure of concrete on water transport,,,"The microstructure of construction materials, such as concrete, influences their transport properties, which are closely linked to the durability of these materials. However, for unsaturated conditions, the connection between microstructure and macroscopic transport properties is still not fully understood. The long term aim of this research is to improve this understanding by computational modelling. In the first step presented here, capillary pores are modelled by a network of tubes, where the distribution of tube diameters are chosen to match typical pore throat diameter distributions observed in experiments. Thus, each tube represents the connection of two pore spaces. The tubes are considered to be filled with either liquid water, or air and water vapour. The water conductivity of a liquid-filled tube, is significantly greater than that of an air and vapour filled tube. Consequently, the hydraulic response of the tubes is highly discontinuous, so that a standard solution procedure commonly used for continuum mass transport problems is not well suited. Therefore, a solution procedure based on a series of stationary transport problems has been applied. Each of the stationary analyses assumes a different arrangement of liquid, and air and vapour-filled tubes based on am uniformly applied capillary suction. The arrangement is determined by a capillary suction threshold given by the Laplace-Young equation. The model was applied to investigate the influence of the coefficient of variation of tube diameters and porosity on the network conductivity for different capillary suctions.",2014

A Study on Occupancy and Compressive Strength of Concrete with Produced Injection Method,,SILICA-FUME,"Concrete is a composite construction material made primarily of aggregate, cement, and water. Fresh concrete must have certain features. These are shown in durability, workability, compressive strength, flexural strength, shrinkage, impact resistance, wear, and so forth. In this study, compressive strength, erosion, and attrition behavior of concrete with silica fume additive produced by injection method were researched. Concrete with high occupancy is produced with injection. Use of more than 10% silica fume increases the fresh concrete's need for mixed water significantly. It was observed that as the ratio of silica fume additive increases, concrete becomes stronger against compression, erosion, and attrition.",2014
Study of Density and Modulus of Elasticity of Lightweight Concrete with Brazilian Aggregate,Construction materials and components; Alternative materials; Lightweight concrete; Brazilian expanded clay; Density; Modulus of Elasticity,,"Concrete is one of the oldest building materials and applying known to humankind. From 1800s, with the advent of Portland cement concrete has taken a prominent place among the construction materials due to large values of strength, durability and versatility it offered compared to other products, allowing the molding of the various architectural forms. Until the early 80s, the modern concrete remained only as a mixture of cement, aggregates and water, however, in recent decades, due to the development of new techniques and products, the concrete has been undergoing constant changes([1]). This article discusses the application of technology of lightweight aggregates for concrete production, for use in building elements such as structural panels or fence. Developed an experimental program for the analysis of concrete, with the primary objective to characterize the properties of the parts in the hardened state. The results showed that the lightweight aggregate concrete with Brazilian expanded clay are extremely suitable for the production of prefabricated elements slender, mainly due to the reduction in density and excellent performance in mechanical properties, especially modulus of elasticity, despite the low toughness of lightweight aggregate.",2014
The Utilization of Aluminum Waste As Sand Replacement In Concrete,Aluminum waste; Environmental Pollution; Construction Material; Recycle Material; Concrete,,"Development activities in construction sector have caused serious problems throughout the world as the natural resource depletion and produce large amounts of waste. In Malaysia, the main problem appeared when most of the waste was abandoned and not recycling. Such conditions can cause serious problem such as environmental pollution. This research utilizes aluminum waste as sand replacement in concrete. The use of these materials not only helps in the natural resources such as sand, aggregate, cement and other building. However, it also helps in reducing the manufacturing cost of the concrete. In addition, the reduction in the cost of waste disposal, saving manpower and protect the environment from the effects of pollution are the benefits derived from the use of waste materials. A study was conducted on the use of recyclable aluminum materials, as sand replacement material in concrete mix with replacement of 1%, 2% and 5%. Lab tests, including slump tests, compressive strength and water absorption were conducted in this study. As a result, samples containing 1% aluminum waste has better performance in terms of strength and containing 5% aluminum waste has good resistance to water absorption. Using aluminum waste in concrete is an interesting way in recycling waste thus can reduce waste disposal on sites and also can conserve the natural resources.",2014
Green Lightweight Concrete Made from Natural Para Rubber Product,Green Technology; Lightweight Concrete; Para Rubber Seed Shall Aggregate; Natural Para Rubber,,"Para Rubber Seed Shell (PRSS) as a coarse aggregate and coated by vulcanization and mixing epoxy natural rubber (ENR) was investigated. Natural rubber latex (60% DRC) was applied in two stages. Firstly stage, synthetic natural latex (ENR-35) solution was coated on the first layer of PRSS. After that, PRSS was coated by vulcanization in second layer. Then, pre-wetting was performed before mixing or casting the concrete for 5 days. Finally, CPRSS (Coated Para Rubber Seed Shell) was produced. The CPRSS aggregate was cast as self consolidation concrete (SCC) with different ratios of ordinary Portland cement: sand: CPRSS for 0.8-1: 0.6-0.85: 0.04-0.12 by weight, respectively and constant water/binder ratio at 0.45 throughtout this study. The ENR-35 was also used about 5% of the water content. However, the Concrete was wrapped with polyvinyl sheet to prevent moisture loss during setting and curing in ambient temperature (29 degrees C, 84%RH) for 28 days. The fresh concrete to slump test, harden concrete with bulk density and compressive strength of whole formulations was carried out to determine.

Cheap Mix Design of the Rock-Filled Concrete Materials,Rock-filled concrete; Cheap mix design; Self-compacting concrete,RHEOLOGY,"Rock-filled concrete (RFC) is an innovative dam construction material that has been developed quickly in China since 2003. The concrete is produced by pouring the Self-compacting concrete (SCC) into the voids of large rock chunks, with a minimum size of 300 mm, in a formwork. To date, all the practical applications have shown that using RFC in dam constructions has significant economic and environmental benefits. Total construction cost is reduced due to using large amount of rock chunks, which can amount to roughly 55% of the total volume of RFC. When producing SCC, we make full use of local raw materials (e.g. fly ash, limestone) and optimize mix design based on the simple mini-slump flow tests on pastes to obtain better workability and lower cost. SCC with excellent workability can be obtained even the powder material is limestone powder alone. It is indicated that RFC is a potential and promising material for use in future concrete dams.",2014
EVALUATION OF GROOVING METHOD TO POSTPONE DEBONDING OF FRP LAMINATES IN WPC-FRP BEAMS,wood plastic composite; grooving method; debonding; flexural strength; composite FRP sheets; beam; reinforced,FLEXURAL PERFORMANCE; SURFACE PREPARATION; REINFORCED GLULAM; WOOD BEAMS; COMPOSITES; CONCRETE; SHEETS; MEMBERS,"The use of lightweight construction material with high corrosion resistance and low cost plays an important role in the design and construction of marine structures such as waterfronts. One of the most common methods for strengthening the structures is composite fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) sheet that is used for member retrofitting including wood plastic composite (WPC). The WPC material is produced from wood and compressed resin, which has good mechanical properties as well as economic benefits. The main problem of WPC reinforced with FRP sheets is the debonding of the sheet from WPC surface, which leads to premature and non-economic failure in members. One of the existing methods to solve this problem is surface preparation. However, surface preparation of wood plastic composite has some additional problems, such as operational cost, environmental pollution, etc. Therefore, to avoid debonding, another method has been used, known as the grooving method at the lower parts of beams. The laboratory used 50 I-shaped specimens with the same geometrical and mechanical properties. Initially, some slots such as longitudinal, transverse and diagonal grooves were created on the surface of specimens and filled by an epoxy. All beams were armed using one or two layers of GFRP sheets embedded at the lower part and were tested under four-point flexural loading. Grooves of different shapes, various widths and depths as well as the number of reinforcement layers were determined for considering their effect on the beam's behaviour. The results expressed that the debonding of FRP sheets can be delayed by selecting the longitudinal grooves with certain width and depth, which also leads to resistance improvement.",2014
Structural-grade concrete containing FBC and PCC residues. Part II: Partial-cement concrete,,,"Part I of this study focused on the fresh and hardened properties of different non-cement concretes containing pulverised coal combustion (PCC) fly ash and fluidised bed combustion (FBC) spent bed in order to ascertain their capabilities and drawbacks in the production of structural-grade concrete. While these mixtures produced sufficient structural strength, their long setting times and excessive soaked sulfate-induced expansions posed major limitations on their acceptability as viable construction materials. In order to mitigate these concerns, Part II of the study, presented here, evaluates the characteristics of a number of partial-cement concretes in comparison with those of non-cement and a reference (control) Portland cement concrete. The test results revealed that the two above-mentioned concerns were eliminated with proper mixture proportioning of partial-cement concretes. It was found that while early-age compressive strengths of partial-cement concretes were lower than those of the reference concrete, late strengths exceeded those of the reference concrete. Their plastic and drying shrinkages were also lower than those of the reference concrete. The studied partial-cement concretes also displayed resistance to abrasion superior to that of the reference concrete under dry conditions, whereas the opposite results were obtained under wet conditions.",2014
Classification of major construction materials in construction environments using ensemble classifiers,Ensemble classifier; Color; Construction material detection; Data mining techniques; Image processing,COMBINING MULTIPLE CLASSIFIERS; INTRUSION DETECTION; SYSTEM; DIVERSITY; RECOGNITION; COMBINATION; ALGORITHMS; PREDICTION; COMPONENTS; ACCURACY,"The automatic detection of construction materials in images acquired on a construction site has been regarded as a critical topic. Recently, several data mining techniques have been used as a way to solve the problem of detecting construction materials. These studies have applied single classifiers to detect construction materials and distinguish them from the background by using color as a feature. Recent studies suggest that combining multiple classifiers (into what is called a heterogeneous ensemble classifier) would show better performance than using a single classifier. However, the performance of ensemble classifiers in construction material detection is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the performance of six single classifiers and potential ensemble classifiers on three data sets: one each for concrete, steel, and wood. A heterogeneous voting-based ensemble classifier was created by selecting base classifiers which are diverse and accurate; their prediction probabilities for each target class were averaged to yield a final decision for that class. In comparison with the single classifiers, the ensemble classifiers performed better in the three data sets overall. This suggests that it is better to use an ensemble classifier to enhance the detection of construction materials in images acquired on a construction site. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding the regional context of sustainable concrete in Asia: Case studies in Mongolia and Singapore,Sustainable development; Concrete; Construction; Mongolia; Singapore,,"In order to improve the sustainability of the Asian concrete industry, it is important to understand the effect of regional context considering the widely varying socio-economic conditions present in Asia. This research in Mongolia and Singapore was conducted as a continuation of previous studies in Japan, Thailand and South Korea in order to further contribute to understanding regional context, particularly geographic, climate, and economic factors. Geography and climate were found to strongly affect the means by which durability should be assured in each country, as Singapore has a tropical climate whereas Mongolia experiences a large temperature variation with extremely cold winters. The ability to access construction materials and resources was also related to geography, as Singapore, while resource poor, is an international shipping center, whereas Mongolia has abundant resources but few access routes for imports. Quality control issues in Mongolia could be understood in the context of the lower level of economic development, whereas in Singapore the high level of development has lead to an emphasis on green construction, with the government taking the lead in implementing new systems and technologies.

Behaviour of recycled aggregate concrete filled stainless steel stub columns,Concrete-filled steel tubes; Stainless steel; Recycled aggregate concrete; Axial compression; Nonlinear analysis; Strength,TUBULAR COLUMNS; PERFORMANCE; TUBES; LOADINGS,"Past research indicates that recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) could be successfully used in concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns. Their yielded performance is almost as good as that of the traditional CFST columns. In addition, as a comparatively new construction material, stainless steel can be used to replace carbon steel for enhancing the durability and ductility of CFST columns. With an aim to combine the advantages of both RAC and stainless steel, RAC is proposed in this paper to be used as a filling material for stainless steel tubes. A test program is introduced in this paper to investigate the behaviour of RAC-filled stainless steel stub columns. For comparison purposes, reference specimens with carbon steel tubes are also tested.

Observations on the electrical resistivity of steel fibre reinforced concrete,Steel fibre reinforced concrete; Electrical resistivity; Experimental and analytical analyses,CEMENT COMPOSITES; IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; SITE MEASUREMENT; CORROSION; CONDUCTIVITY; SPECTRA,"Steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) is in many ways a well-known construction material, and its use has gradually increased over the last decades. The mechanical properties of SFRC are well described based on the theories of fracture mechanics. However, knowledge on other material properties, including the electrical resistivity, is sparse. Among others, the electrical resistivity of concrete has an effect on the corrosion process of possible embedded bar reinforcement and transfer of stray current. The present paper provides experimental results concerning the influence of the fibre volume fraction and the moisture content of the SFRC on its electrical resistivity. The electrical resistivity was measured by alternating current (AC) at 126 Hz. Moreover, an analytical model for the prediction of the electrical resistivity of SFRC is presented. The analytical model is capable of predicting the observed correlation between the fibre volume fraction and the electrical resistivity of the composite (the SFRC) for conductive fibres and moisture saturated concrete. This indicates that the steel fibres were conducting when measuring the electrical resistivity by AC at 126 Hz. For partly saturated concrete the model underestimated the influence of the addition of fibres. The results indicate that the addition of steel fibres reduce the electrical resistivity of concrete if the fibres are conductive. This represents a hypothetical case where all fibres are depassivated (corroding) which was created to obtain a conservative estimate on the influence of fibres on the electrical resistivity of concrete. It was observed that within typical ranges of variation the influence of the moisture content on the electrical resistivity was larger than the effect of addition of conductive steel fibres, but also that the relative impact on the electrical resistivity due to conductive steel fibres increased when the moisture content of the concrete was reduced.",2014

The objective of this study was to estimate and characterize carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during construction of agricultural reservoir embankments for the quantitative environmental assessment and management of CO2 emissions using life cycle assessment method. Two reservoirs with different foundation treatment and construction components were selected in this study and their characteristics in CO2 emissions were compared. And CO2 emissions were calculated separately for each of the following major components: construction materials, equipment, and transport. The basic unit of CO2 emissions for construction materials was calculated using the 2009 input-output tables in Korea and the basic unit of CO2 emissions for equipment of transport and construction was also calculated based on the amount of fuel used in a unit time. According to the study results, the construction of a water supply process appeared to generate the most emissions among all processes for the two sites. Emissions due to equipment were the highest in site A, while materials generated the most emissions in site B. Differences in emissions are due to differences in the construction process. While the operation time of the equipment in site A increased due to the cofferdam process and a large amount of cement was used in the foundation process in site B. Characteristic of CO2 emissions differs with different construction processes and thus construction processes need to be optimized for environmental friendly development of agricultural infrastructure through estimation and characterization of CO2 emissions.",2014
Experimental study of the fire resistance of walls and floors constructed with steel studs and steel joists,light-gauge steel; fire resistance; steel-framed house; fire test; finishing materials,TEMPERATURES,"Steel-framed houses using light-gauge steel as a structural member have been developed and constructed since the early 2000s as a new construction pattern in the low-rise construction market in Korea. Generally, the steel frames consist of two major load-carrying elements such as load-bearing wall and floor construction made up of approximately 1.0-mm cold-formed light-gauge steel and light-weight boards. Therefore, the steel frames are very simple to construct and make the construction period shorter than the ordinary construction type or concrete-based construction. In Korea, regardless of the construction material types, the building regulation requires 1-h fire rating for apartment buildings of four stories or under. To meet the fire resistance, new models of load-bearing wall and floor should be developed. From the fire test results, two layer gypsum boards of 12.5mm in thickness reinforced with glass fiber were proven satisfactory to provide 1-h fire resistance with load-bearing wall and floor.

Utilization potential of fly ash together with silica fume in autoclaved aerated concrete production,Fly ash; silica fume; AAC; microstructure; C-S-H phase development,FOAMED CONCRETE; LIME,"The increase in the number of thermal power plants has led to the production of an increasing amount of fly ash that causes high environmental impact in Turkey. Many researchers around the world are looking at methods of gainful utilization and disposal of fly ash. However, the construction materials industry is the most suitable way to mass consumption of the fly ash waste. In this study, the utilization potential of fly ash and silica fume in Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) production were investigated. Optimum fly ash/cement ratio was determined, and this composition was improved by the silica fume addition. Strength-Microstructure relations of the products were investigated. Crystalline C-S-H phases of Tobermorite and Xonotlite were developed after autoclaving at 4 bar. Silica fume addition was found to be useful for the prevention of the ettringite phase in the product. Silica fume addition improved the hydrothermal conditions during the autoclaving of the mixtures.",2014
Energy Efficient Design and Sustainable Buildings,Energy efficient buildings; sustainable housings; comfort levels; alpolic cladding; thermopore; insulation,HOUSING DEVELOPMENT; CONSTRUCTION,"The use of energy in buildings and infrastructure has increased many folds suggesting that alternate means must be devised to conserve energy and operate the buildings with sustainable means. For the buildings, energy efficiency can be achieved using the insulation materials, improved architectural technique, and modified construction methodology. Energy demand to operate buildings must be reduced to develop energy efficient and sustainable buildings for the future, without compromising the living comfort, performance, and services. The architecture, design, and orientation of building are altered to introduce energy efficient and sustainable design in commercial, residential, and industrial buildings. Observations and experiments were carried out on four existing buildings and a model was studied and compared based on orientation, construction materials used, type of construction, and architectural techniques. The results show that, using Alpolic Cladding and double layered windows at outer face of buildings gives 8% more thermal efficiency than the ordinary construction. The cavity wall construction enhances the energy conservation of the building by 6% as compared to traditional construction of block masonry. The model studies show that using cavity wall and Structural Concrete Insulated Panel (SLIP) as cladding/infill walls in frame structures can reduce the energy demand of the building upto 3% Building orientation, architecture, use of latest energy efficient materials, and enhanced construction techniques contribute significantly towards energy efficient performance of buildings.",2014
Challenges and opportunities in tropical concreting,Tropical concreting; temperature effects,,"Much of the technical knowledge on concrete as a construction material originates from research and experiences in temperate regions of the world. Unlike other construction materials, such as steel, timber and masonry, the behaviour of concrete is much more influenced by its service environment, temperature and relative humidity. The transfer of knowledge on concrete, developed for temperate climate, calls for satisfactory adjustment when adopted for tropical climates. These are challenges which also create opportunities for innovative solutions. Firstly a brief review of the main effects of tropical temperatures on properties of fresh and hardened concrete are presented. Methods to mitigate the less desirable influences of temperature are considered. Some advantages of the tropical ambient temperature on specific applications are described. The urgent need to gather information from monitoring durability performance in tropical exposure environments in order to calibrate future performance based design approaches for durability is emphasised, as these are expected in the coming years. A significant period of local experience and monitored performance data in tropical environment is needed to provide input to calibrate these design models for tropical exposure when they have reached international consensus.

USING RECYCLED COMPONENTS FROM POST-CONSUMER TYRES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS INDUSTRY,post-consumer tyres; recycling; environmental impact; pavements,,"The post-consumer tyres represent an important environmental concern, due to their enormous quantities resulted every year, which require important landfill spaces for disposal. To reduce this pressure on the environment, construction materials industry aims to find new products and applications, which can benefit from the useful proprieties of the main components of tyres (rubber, steel, and textiles). The first component which has been valorized is the recycled rubber extracted from tyres, used at present in various products like rubberized asphalt, roofing, traffic safety, playground surfacing, etc. Besides rubber, the current research activity is also referring to the recycling of steel and textile fibres. An extended research program was undertaken at the ""Gheorghe Asachi"" Technical University of Iasi, concerning the use of the recycled steel tyre-cord fibres as reinforcement in conventional concrete and roller-compacted concrete for transport pavements. The different pavement alternatives have been tested using the accelerated loading test facilities at the Civil Engineering Faculty of Iasi. The environmental performances of these alternative pavements solutions were also evaluated by life-cycle analysis, using the GaBi software. The paper presents the main results obtained in these studies.",2014
A non-destructive tool for detecting changes in the hardness of engineering materials: Application of the Equotip durometer in the coastal zone,Weathering; Coastal engineering; Concrete; Hardness; Equotip; Marine,UNCONFINED COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; SIMULATED INTERTIDAL CONDITIONS; REINFORCEMENT CORROSION; SHORE PLATFORMS; SCHMIDT HAMMER; COVER CRACKING; ROCK STRENGTH; CONCRETE; PREDICTION; CARBONATE,"Non-destructive tools capable of measuring the condition and geomechanical properties of construction materials through time are of considerable value in engineering. Here, the ability of the Equotip durometer (Proceq, type D) to detect changes in the hardness of concrete and rock exposed to marine conditions was tested. Results indicated a progressive loss of hardness for limestone, while concrete hardness increased. Granite showed no significant change. Our results relate to alteration of the materials primarily via chemical and biological weathering. The Equotip is sensitive enough to detect subtle changes in the condition of construction materials over relatively short periods of time. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Reuse of thermal power plant slag in hot bituminous mixes,Thermal power plant slag; Hot mix asphalt; Roads; Test section; Waste recycling,FLY-ASH; BOTTOM ASH; ASPHALT; CONCRETE,"The revalorization of industrial waste plays a key role in the solution of environmental and economic problems in the construction sector, thus actions contributing to the symbiosis between industries in the same region are of great benefit since they optimize resources in the area and also open the door to new business opportunities. In recent years, the electricity produced by thermal power stations has become a renewable energy source of great potential. Nevertheless, this type of energy is not without drawbacks because of the coal ash and boiler slag produced by coal combustion. Although the ash has different application as a construction material, boiler slag is more problematic since it must be deposited at landfills. The accumulation of this waste has become a serious economic and environmental problem. This paper presents the results of a research project, which analyzed the viability of reusing thermal power plant slag as a substitute for natural aggregate in the manufacture of hot mix asphalt (HMA). For this purpose, the waste was first characterized and tested in the laboratory with a view to its subsequent use in HMA. Based on the positive laboratory results, a test road section was built with this material so that its performance could be compared with that of the road section paved with a conventional HMA. The results obtained confirmed the aptness of thermal power plant slag for use in road construction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013
Prediction of high performance concrete strength using Genetic Programming with geometric semantic genetic operators,High performance concrete; Strength prediction; Artificial intelligence; Genetic Programming; Geometric operators; Semantics,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; FUZZY-LOGIC; FLY-ASH; CEMENT,"Concrete is a composite construction material made primarily with aggregate, cement, and water. In addition to the basic ingredients used in conventional concrete, high-performance concrete incorporates supplementary cementitious materials, such as fly ash and blast furnace slag, and chemical admixture, such as superplasticizer. Hence, high-performance concrete is a highly complex material and modeling its behavior represents a difficult task. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system based on Genetic Programming for the prediction of high-performance concrete strength. The system we propose is called Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming, and it is based on recently defined geometric semantic genetic operators for Genetic Programming. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed system for the prediction of concrete strength. In particular, the new method provides significantly better results than the ones produced by standard Genetic Programming and other machine learning methods, both on training and on out-of-sample data.

Microwave dielectric heating to disassemble a modified cementitious joint,Microwave; Dielectric heating; Cementitious joint; Modifier; Disassembly property,CONCRETE,"According to existing theory on the deterioration of cement and concrete, a cement hardener undergoes a hydrate disassembly reaction at high temperatures of 300 A degrees C or above; this increases the internal void volume and decreases the residual strength. This weakness mechanism has already been applied to manufacturing recycled aggregates and has reached the stage of practical application for removing adhered mortar from the aggregate surface. However, heating using an external heat source consumes a considerable amount of energy, and greenhouse gases are emitted during the recycling process because of low energy efficiency. In this study, a susceptor with outstanding microwave heating efficiency was selected, and the temperature elevation characteristics from the microwave heating of cementitious material containing the susceptor were analyzed. Through measurement, the bond strength of a cementitious joint including a modifier with the susceptor was found to weaken after microwave heating; thus, a new cementitious joint that can be reused or recycled as construction material and members is proposed. If the susceptor can selectively make cement material vulnerable in a short time by absorbing microwaves at the cementitious joint, the combined waste from the cementitious joint can be separated into single materials.",2013
Self-Healing Efficiency of Cementitious Materials Containing Microcapsules Filled with Healing Adhesive: Mechanical Restoration and Healing Process Monitored by Water Absorption,,TOUGHENED EPOXY COMPOSITE; FATIGUE CRACKS; CONCRETE; REPAIR; DAMAGE; PERMEABILITY; RETARDATION; PERFORMANCE; POLYMERS,"Autonomous crack healing of cementitious composite, a construction material that is susceptible to cracking, is of great significance to improve the serviceability and to prolong the longevity of concrete structures. In this study, the St-DVB microcapsules enclosing epoxy resins as the adhesive agent were embedded in cement paste to achieve self-healing capability. The self-healing efficiency was firstly assessed by mechanical restoration of the damaging specimens after being matured. The flexural and compressive configurations were both used to stimulate the localized and distributed cracks respectively. The effects of some factors, including the content of microcapsules, the curing conditions and the degree of damage on the healing efficiency were investigated. Water absorption was innovatively proposed to monitor and characterize the evolution of crack networks during the healing process. The healing cracks were observed by SEM-EDS following. The results demonstrated that the capsule-containing cement paste can achieve the various mechanical restorations depending on the curing condition and the degree of damage. But the voids generated by the surfactants compromised the strength. Though no noticeable improved stiffness obtained, the increasing fracture energy was seen particularly for the specimen acquiring 60% pre-damage. The sorptivity and amount of water decreased with cracks healing by the adhesive, which contributed to cut off and block ingress of water. The micrographs by SEM-EDS also validated that the cracks were bridged by the hardened epoxy as the dominated elements of C and O accounted for 95% by mass in the nearby cracks.",2013
"Bioprotection and disturbance: Seaweed, microclimatic stability and conditions for mechanical weathering in the intertidal zone",Bioprotection; Biogeomorphology; Intertidal weathering; Ecosystem engineering; Microclimate; Ecosystem services,SHORE PLATFORMS; COASTAL INFRASTRUCTURE; ECOSYSTEM ENGINEERS; KAIKOURA PENINSULA; SURFACE EXPANSION; THERMAL RESPONSE; WAVE EXPOSURE; SOUTH ISLAND; ROCKY SHORES; NEW-ZEALAND,"As well as their destructive roles, plants, animals and microorganisms contribute to geomorphology and ecology via direct and indirect bioprotection, which can reduce weathering and erosion. For example, indirect bioprotection can operate via biotic influences on microclimate whereby physical decay processes associated with fluctuations in temperature and moisture (salt crystallization, thermal fatigue and wetting-drying), are limited. In the intertidal zone, the spatial and temporal distribution of macroalgae (seaweeds) is patchy, related to physical and ecological conditions for colonization and growth, and the nature and frequency of natural and anthropogenic disturbance. We examined the influence of seaweed canopies (Fucus spp.) on near-surface microclimate and, by implication, on conditions for mechanical rock decay and under-canopy ecology. Monitoring on hard artificial coastal structures in South West England, UK, built from limestone and concrete showed that both the range and maxima of daily summertime temperatures were significantly lower, by an average of 56% and 25%, respectively, in areas colonized by seaweed compared to experimentally cleared areas. Short-term microclimatic variability (minutes-hours) was also significantly reduced, by an average of 78% for temperature and 71% for humidity, under algal canopies during low-tide events. Using seaweed as an example, we develop a conceptual model of the relationship between biological cover and microclimate in the intertidal zone. Disturbance events that remove or drastically reduce seaweed cover mediate shifts between relatively stable and unstable states with respect to mechanical decay and ecological stress associated with heat and desiccation. In urban coastal environments where disturbance may be frequent, facilitating the establishment and recovery of canopy-forming species on rocks and engineered structures could enhance the durability of construction materials as well as support conservation, planning and policy targets for biodiversity enhancement.

The operation of a building accounts for a large portion of its total CO2 emissions. Most efforts are focused on improving the energy efficiency related to the operation of a building. The relative importance of the energy and CO2 emissions from the construction materials increases with the increasing number of low-energy buildings. To minimize the life-cycle energy use of a building, the energy consumed from both materials in the construction phase as well as the energy consumed from the operation of the building must be reduced. In this study, an optimal design method for composite columns in high-rise buildings using a genetic algorithm is proposed to reduce cost and CO2 emissions from the structural materials in the construction phase. The proposed optimal method minimizes the total cost, including the additional cost calculated based on CO2 emissions from composite columns, while satisfying the structural design criteria and constructability conditions. The proposed optimal method is applied to an actual 35-story building, and the effective use of structural materials for the sustainable design of composite columns is investigated. It is shown that using more concrete than steel section and using high-strength materials are economically and environmentally effective methods.",2013

This composite has been developed by the activation of slag and silica fume, without using portland cement. A comparative experimental study on the mechanical properties, microstructure, fresh-state properties, leaching of ions, bond to steel, and dimensional stability of RPC produced with portland cement (CRPC) and alkali-activated cement (ARPC) has been implemented. Test results show that ARPC has a very different micrbstructure with a great number of nano-sized pores compared to CRPC. Although these two RPC mixtures have similar compressive strength values, ARPC has significantly higher flexural performance, fracture energy, and bond to steel compared to CRPC. ARPC composites seem to be a good alternative to CRPC because of these superior properties and reduced environmental problems.",2013
Preliminary experimental study on the effects of surface-applied photocatalytic products on the durability of reinforced concrete,Photocatalytic products; Reinforced concrete structures; Durability; Carbonation; Reinforcing bar corrosion; Experimental tests,ACCELERATED CARBONATION; CORROSION PERFORMANCE; SILICA FUME; FLY-ASH; BARS,"The aim of this paper is to assess, by the results of suitable experimental tests, the durability performances of surface-applied concrete layers that incorporate a photocatalytic material such as titanium dioxide. The use of photocatalytic materials for air purification has been developing rapidly in the last decades. Within this framework, the proposed experimental study is particularly significant considering that, although there are many advantages in applying photocatalytic construction materials, during the TiO2-photocatalysis a large variety of organics, viruses, bacteria, fungi, algae can be totally degraded and mineralized to CO2, H2O and harmless inorganic anions. The mineralized amounts of CO2, deriving from both the photocatalytic oxidation itself and the external ambient, can progressively activate a chemical deterioration due to carbonation. It is then important to investigate the resistance properties of photocatalytic concrete products against carbonation. The effects of the photocatalytic activity on the durability of concrete have been assessed by using accelerated carbonation and corrosion of reinforcing steel tests. In order to keep the photocatalytic process ongoing, specimens with finish coatings containing TiO2 were put in direct contact with air (water in the form of humidity) and were subjected to light radiation. Results show that photocatalytic concrete products applied on the surface of concrete improve the property of carbonation resistance and reduce the corrosion propagation rate of reinforcing bars with respect to the case of cement coatings without any photocatalysts. The adopted experimental procedure can give a first contribution in order to understand if the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide creates a photocatalysed system acting as a protective barrier against the deterioration processes.

Durability of autoclaved construction materials of sewage sludge-cement-fly ash-furnace slag,Sewage sludge; Durability; Hydration products; Microstructure; Constructional materials,HEAVY-METALS; DRY SLUDGE; STABILIZATION/SOLIDIFICATION; PHOSPHOGYPSUM; CONCRETE; IMPACT,"In the present work, we demonstrate an alternative for the final disposal of sewage sludge by using it as an additive in a mixture with cement, fly ash and furnace slag, which can potentially be used to develop newly promising construction materials by autoclave curing. The dewatered sewage sludge is obtained with fly ash and lime. These physical conditioners contribute to both dewatering process and solidifying/stabilizing of sludge. Various mechanical properties such as flexural strength, compressive strength and the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) were evaluated. To evaluate long-term performance, different types of accelerated attacks, i.e. freezing-thawing cycles, accelerated carbonation, wet-dry cycles, and heat-cool cycles were also determined. The obtained test results were indicated that the autoclaved samples exhibit good long-term performance after evaluations of different durability tests. XRD patterns show that the hydration products of autoclaved samples are katoite and C-S-H phases, which mainly contribute to strength of autoclaved products. Morphologies of autoclaved samples also demonstrate the existence of the gel-like and honeycomb-like hydrated products. The results show that this new construction material could be applied as many construction and building materials, i.e. landfill liners and building blocks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This subject has encouraged new researches on biocomposite concretes with the aim to exploit renewable resources like vegetal fibres intended as materials whose production processes are generally characterized by low costs and energy demand. This biocomposite is obviously much lighter than concrete and, therefore, can be suitably used in such cases where a structure cannot be overloaded, for instance in the realization of a green covering on top of a preexistent building. In this work, a first analysis of the thermal and structural behaviour of a biocomposite concrete, constituted by a mineral matrix (lime) with the addition of vegetal fibres (hemp), has been carried out, with particular attention to the amount of fibres and its granulometry in the mixture. The drying process contemplate a permanence of the material in a thermostatic chamber. The analysis carried out shows that hemp can be used both for the realization of insulation panel (hemp fibres alone) and as a construction material (hemp bast and concrete mix). This biocomposite has shown good insulation properties and some mechanical resistance. However, the results show that further analyses should be carried out on the drying process of the material, as it can greatly influences thermal and mechanical properties.",2013

Although many aspects of UHPFRC have been investigated extensively, the size effects on structural strength of UHPFRC members remain largely unknown. This is mainly due to the lack of sufficient and reliable experimental data. This study investigates the size effects on flexural strength of similar notched UHPFRC beams under three-point bending tests. Nonlinear finite element simulations using the concrete damage plasticity (CDP) model in ABAQUS were also conducted, using material properties extracted from uniaxial tensile and compressive laboratory tests. It was found that the size effect on the beam nominal strength is little due to high ductility of UHPFRC. The numerical simulations using the CDP model can predict load-displacement curves and crack propagation process with good agreement with experimental data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

It is estimated that approximately 1.7 million tonnes of ISSA are produced annually world-wide and is likely to increase in the future. Although most ISSA is currently landfilled, various options have been investigated that allow recycling and beneficial resource recovery. These include the use of ISSA as a substitute for clay in sintered bricks, tiles and pavers, and as a raw material for the manufacture of lightweight aggregate. ISSA has also been used to form high density glass-ceramics. Significant research has investigated the potential use of ISSA in blended cements for use in mortars and concrete, and as a raw material for the production of Portland cement. However, all these applications represent a loss of the valuable phosphate content in ISSA, which is typically comparable to that of a low grade phosphate ore. ISSA has significant potential to be used as a secondary source of phosphate for the production of fertilisers and phosphoric acid. Resource efficient approaches to recycling will increasingly require phosphate recovery from ISSA, with the remaining residual fraction also considered a useful material, and therefore further research is required in this area.

Double edge wedge splitting (DEWS): an indirect tension test to identify post-cracking behaviour of fibre reinforced cementitious composites,High performance fiber reinforced cementitious composites; Tensile behaviour; Fiber orientation; Double edge wedge splitting test,MAGNETIC METHOD; CONCRETE; ORIENTATION; DISPERSION,"Experimental identification of the tensile constitutive behaviour of fibre reinforced cementitious composites represents a foremost step in design approaches for structural elements made with this kind of advanced construction materials. To this purpose, international standards and guidelines recommend either direct tension or/and bending tests, coupled with an inverse analysis procedure, both featuring pros and cons which have been exhaustively highlighted and discussed in these last years. The tremendous developments of self compacting fibre reinforced concretes have furthermore highlighted the need of duly taking into account, within the aforementioned identification procedure, the likely flow-induced alignment of fibres with the applied tensile stress. In this paper a novel experimental testing technique, called double edge wedge splitting test, has been presented and validated, also by means of nonlinear finite element analysis. The test, as it will be shown, is able to yield directly, i.e. with no need for back analysis, the tensile stress versus crack opening ""constitutive relationship"" of the material, though performing an ""indirect"" test, i.e. by applying a compressive load to the specimen. Both the simplicity of the indirect tensile testing technique and the straightforwardness of the identification procedure surely represent a distinctive and extremely attractive characteristic of the proposed test. Furthermore, the test features a compact specimen geometry, which can be even easily ""cored"" from existing structures, and a ""notch preordained"" fracture plane, which can be aligned to any desired angle with respect to the expected flow-induced fibre orientation. This makes the proposed test suitable for a thorough characterization of the influence of fibre orientation on the material constitutive behaviour, as it may be required by a casting process tailored to the intended applications.",2013

Case Study on the Effect of 690 mpa (100 ksi) Steel Reinforcement on Concrete Productivity in Buildings,Reinforced concrete; Steel; Construction materials; Productivity; Case studies; Reinforced concrete; High-strength steel; Material technology; Productivity,CONSTRUCTION; SAFETY,"High-strength steel reinforcement in buildings had previously been limited to specialized applications, but recently published design guidance allows expanded use. A case study, conducted to investigate productivity benefits of using 690mpa (100ksi) versus 414mpa (60ksi) reinforcement, found that there was little to no benefit in using 690mpa (100ksi) steel in slabs, post-tensioned girders, and columns, but the beam reinforcement weight was reduced by 36%. The 2010 material cost ratio of 690mpa (100ksi) to 414mpa (60ksi) reinforcement was two, outstripping the weight reduction. However, labor cost is a function of weight, bringing the overall cost of 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement to within 35% of 414mpa (60ksi) reinforcement cost. The material cost ratio will presumably decrease over time; if it drops by 30% or more, 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement will be more economical. Labor costs, which vary by location, strongly influence the productivity benefits of 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement. The use of 690mpa (100ksi) reinforcement is more favorable in expensive labor markets and it appears to be currently competitive in some. The paper's primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the quantitative understanding of the economic factors that influence the ability of 690mpa (100ksi) steel reinforcement to have a productivity advantage over the use of conventional 414mpa (60ksi) steel reinforcement. Practitioners, designers, and researchers can use this information to understand the cost and productivity impact of high-strength reinforcing steel.",2013
Laboratory-Scale Investigation on Band Gradations of Aggregate for Concrete,Construction materials; Concrete; Aggregate gradations; Band gradation,,"Aggregate gradations have significant effects on concrete properties because approximately 70% of the volume of concrete is occupied by aggregates.

This paper presents a comparative analysis among available aggregate gradation methodologies and analyzes different aspects of two proposed band gradations through laboratory experiments. The overall research was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, concrete mixes were prepared using different aggregate gradation methodologies to find out the comparatively better aggregate gradation methodology in terms of concrete properties. Analyzing the results of this phase, the newly proposed 5-10-14-18 and 5-10-18-22 band gradations were found to give better concrete properties compared to other aggregate gradation methodologies with respect to concrete workability and compressive strength.

Optimized ecological balance of concrete by using CEM-V composite cements,CEM V; Clinker Substitution; CO2-savings; Composite Cement; ENVIZEO; Eco-Cement; Zeolite,,"Nowadays, concrete is the most commonly used building material worldwide. It is characterized by a very favorable ecological balance compared to other construction material. Nevertheless, attempts are being made to further improve its environmental performance and sustainability. The highest demand for energy in concrete production and its components is required during cement manufacturing. Therefore, the aim is to substitute the CO2- and energy-intensive clinker by additives for cement, such as fly ash, blast furnace slag or natural puzzolana. These additives do not+ need to be fired in the rotary furnace and energy is saved by skipping the energy-consuming firing process. In consequence of adding these additives, blended cements are obtained. CEM V composite cement is a very efficient type of blended cement with high percentage of clinker substitution up to 80 %. By substitution of the CO2- and energy-intensive Portland cement clinker by additives for cement, the properties of the end product are changing. In European countries at present time the use of CEM V cements for structural concrete is strongly restricted due to normative limitations. This circumstance is caused by a lack of experience in using composite cements, the considerable variation of its composition and to some extent to the absence of suitable raw materials.

Its aim is to develop new CEM V compositions for common usage in structural concrete application.",2013
Characteristics and applications of flash metakaolins,Metakaolin; Flash calcination; Spherical metakaolin; Supplementary cementitious material; Geopolymer,PARTICLE-SHAPE; CONCRETE; MORTARS; TECHNOLOGY; KAOLINITE; HYDRATION,"This paper presents physical, chemical and mechanical characteristics of metakaolins obtained from an industrial flash calciner, in order to compare their properties with standard industrial metakaolin produced in a rotary kiln calciner. Three kaolins, with three levels of purity, were calcined by these two different methods to give six different metakaolins for the study. The results showed that the method of calcination did not affect the chemical composition of the metakaolins formed but did influence their physical properties and performance as a supplementary cementitious material when blended with Portland cement, and in geopolymer synthesis. Flash metakaolins have a lower water demand than rotary metakaolins, which can be explained by the morphological properties of the flash metakaolin, induced by the calcination process. Traditional rotary-calcined metakaolins tend to be angular layered particles, whereas flash metakaolins contain spherical particles. Mechanical test results showed that the two methods of calcination can lead to metakaolins with equivalent performance in the synthesis of construction materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Determination of radon exhalation from construction materials using VOC emission test chambers,Radon exhalation; Radon measurement; Building material; Emission test chamber; Indoor Air Quality; Real room radon concentrations,BUILDING-MATERIALS; LUNG-CANCER; FLOOR COVERINGS; RISK; AIR; SAMPLES,"Abstract The inhalation of Rn-222 (radon) decay products is one of the most important reasons for lung cancer after smoking. Stony building materials are an important source of indoor radon. This article describes the determination of the exhalation rate of stony construction materials by the use of commercially available measuring devices in combination with VOC emission test chambers. Five materials - two types of clay brick, clinker brick, light-weight concrete brick, and honeycomb brick - generally used for wall constructions were used for the experiments. Their contribution to real room concentrations was estimated by applying room model parameters given in ISO 16000-9, RP 112, and AgBB. This knowledge can be relevant, if for instance indoor radon concentration is limited by law. The test set-up used here is well suited for application in test laboratories dealing with VOC emission testing.",2013
Prediction of Equivalency Factors for Various Subbase and Base Courses,Subbase course; Base course; Construction materials; Recycling; Material properties; Equivalency factor; Subbase; Base stabilization; Fly ash,,"The generation of waste materials from industries like iron, steel, coal, and so on is so large that all countries are facing a shortage of dumping space for these waste materials and it is also causing serious environmental pollution. There is also a huge shortage of aggregate material. With a view to save the costly aggregates and preserve the environment, it is desirable that local natural materials and industrial wastes are used to the maximum extent. This will also lead to economy. Being bound, these materials produce lesser pollution as compared with the freely dumped state. For example, fly ash, if carried away in the air, is most harmful when inhaled. However, concrete mixes are confined enough to cause pollution. In the research reported in this paper, the equivalency factors for various materials used in subbase and base courses have been evaluated experimentally. Subbase courses made of coarse sand, stone dust, riverbed material, blast furnace slag, and Linz-Donawitz slag have been studied with respect to granular subbase course. For the base course study, various stabilized mixtures and different combinations of wet-mix macadam have been studied with respect to wet-mix macadam mixed with 5% soil. This has been done to find out whether the use of these materials can be significant in pavement construction and, if so, then to what extent. The research reported in this paper has been done with respect to various properties like modulus of elasticity, resilient strain, permanent strain, compressive strength, shear strength, failure load, and so on.",2013
Durability enhancements using fabric formwork,,CHLORIDE BINDING; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; CORROSION RISK; CARBONATION,"By replacing conventional concrete moulds with flexible sheets of permeable fabric, the construction of optimised concrete elements that provide material savings of up to 40% when compared with an equivalent strength prismatic member is possible. This paper details the results of recent tests undertaken at the Building Research Establishment Centre for Innovative Construction Materials at the University of Bath that demonstrate significant additional durability advantages for fabric-cast concrete. Using accelerated test methods, 50% average reductions in both the non-steady state chloride diffusion coefficient and carbonation coefficients were found when comparing concrete samples cast against permeable and impermeable surfaces. Sorptivity, surface hardness and scanning electron microscopy tests demonstrate further beneficial changes in the fabric-cast concrete. The combined results demonstrate that fabric formwork may be used to create structures optimised for strength and durability.",2013
Temperature Dependencies of the Permittivities and Microwave Shielding Effectiveness of a Carbon-containing Electrically Conductive Concrete,microwave processing; thermal treatment; thermal analysis; electrical properties; composite,BUILDING-MATERIALS; DECOMPOSITION; SYSTEM,"Conductive concrete is a construction material that can be utilized for a number of applications: in particular, electromagnetic shielding. In this research, the microwave shielding effectiveness of a carbon containing electrically conductive concrete was determined from both the real and the imaginary permittivities. Also, the permittivities and the shielding effectiveness of a normal concrete were determined for comparison purposes. It was shown that the permittivities of the conductive concrete were significantly higher than those of the normal concrete. The shielding abilities of both of the concretes were determined as a function of concrete thickness and temperature, and the conductive concrete had a superior shielding effectiveness. For the normal concrete, at room temperature and a frequency of 912 MHz, a shielding effectiveness of 30 dB was achieved for a thickness of about 400 cm. For the conductive concrete, under the same conditions, a thickness of only about 3 cm was required to achieve the same shielding effectiveness.",2013
Building Code Requirements for Inspection of Adhesive Anchors in Concrete,Adhesive anchors; Building code; Inspection; Construction materials and methods,,"A proper installation of construction materials is crucial for its performance. Therefore, inspections in building construction have vital importance and are needed to verify that work considered critical to life, public safety, and property protection is being or has been performed according to the approved plans and specifications. Although inspections are required by the legally adopted building codes at certain stages, some building construction activities demand closer scrutiny. This additional level of surveillance is known as special inspection. Installation of adhesive anchors is one of the construction activities that require special inspection. This paper briefly explains the recent revisions to the inspection requirements of postinstalled adhesive anchors in accordance with the American Concrete Institute standard, which is referenced by the 2012 International Building Code, discusses the discrepancies occurring between the two documents, and recommends solutions to allow proper inspections to proceed.",2013

According to Disaster and Emergency Management Presidency of Turkey, the magnitude of the earthquake is 5.7 in local magnitude scale. Although the earthquake can be regarded as a moderate event when considering its magnitude and strong motion recordings, it caused excessive structural damage to buildings in Simav district and several villages in the near vicinity. During the field investigation, different types of structural damage were observed mainly in the reinforced concrete frame buildings with infill walls and masonry buildings with various types of construction materials. Observed damage resulted from several deficiencies in structural and non-structural components of the buildings. Poor construction materials and workmanship, non-conforming earthquake-resistant design and construction techniques and non-ductile detailing are the main reasons for such an extensive damage, as observed in many past earthquakes in Turkey.",2013

Physical properties and mechanical behaviour of concrete made with recycled aggregates and fly ash,Sustainability; Concrete; Recycled aggregates; Fly ash; Experimental tests,PERFORMANCE; DURABILITY,"Enhancing the environmental sustainability of human activities and industrial processes is a common challenge in various branches of modern research and technology. Being characterised by a huge demand of both energy and raw materials and by a significant contribution to the global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), the construction industry is fully concerned by this challenge. Particularly, since concrete is the most widely used construction material, several solutions are nowadays under investigation to reduce the environmental impact of its production processes. They often consist of partially replacing ""natural"" constituents (i.e. aggregates, cement, water, fibres) with recycled ones, in view of the twofold objective of reducing both the demand of raw materials and the amount of waste to be disposed in land-fills. However, the formulation of reliable relationships between the main physical and mechanical properties of concrete produced with the aforementioned recycled constituents is still considered as an open issue. This paper is a contribution to such topic. The results of a wide experimental campaign carried out on concretes made using recycled concrete aggregates (RCAs) and fly-ash (FA) in partial substitution of natural aggregates (NAs) and cement (C) are presented and discussed herein. Particularly, concretes characterised by variable water-binder ratios and produced with different percentages of RCA and variable the content of FA have been tested. Test results have allowed estimating the time evolution of the compressive strength, as well as the tensile strength at 28 days, along with some relevant physical properties, such as permeability and resistance to chloride ion penetration. The feasibility of producing structural concrete made with even significant amounts of the aforementioned recycled constituents and industrial by-products clearly emerges from the experimental results.

This study investigates the CO2 uptake of paste mixtures designed with general use (GU) Portland cement, ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and reactive MgO as cement replacement due to exposure to an accelerated carbonation curing regime with 99.9% concentration of CO2. The CO2 uptake, carbonation mechanism, microstructure and microhardness of cement pastes are examined. Key outcomes revealed that: (i) samples exposed to accelerated carbonation curing exhibit a denser microstructure and higher microhardness in comparison to non-carbonated samples, (ii) irrespective of the presence of reactive MgO, CO2 uptake increases with age from 7 to 56 d, (iii) by 56 d, pastes containing 10% and 20% reactive MgO uptake similar amounts of CO2 in comparison to mixtures without reactive MgO, and (iv) pastes containing 40% reactive MgO uptake the least amount of CO2 however, exhibit the greatest microhardness and the lowest porosity.

Effect of fly ash on the behaviour of polymer concrete with different types of resin,,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; RECYCLED-PET; PREDICTION; STRENGTH; STRESS,"Polymer concrete outperforms its counterpart Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) concrete in terms of its highly desirable mechanical properties. It is emerging as a new construction material due to its high compressive, tensile and flexural strengths, short curing time, impact resistance, chemical resistance and freeze-thaw durability. It has many applications in the building construction industry. A research program has been initiated to improve fundamental understanding of this material and to provide the knowledge required for its broad utilization. Three types of resins (polyester, vinylester and epoxy resin) combined with fly ash and sand were used to make the organic polymer concrete mortar. A novel approach based on volumetric properties of sand was used in designing the mixes. This paper presents and discusses the results from an investigation of uniaxial compressive stress-strain relationship of polymer based concrete. The effect of resin (binder), sand and fly ash contents on the compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and ductility of polyester, vinylester and epoxy resin based polymer filler is reported. It has been found that polymer concrete mortar can achieve compressive strengths in a range of 90-100 MPa. Tensile strengths were as high as 15 MPa for vinylester based polymer concrete. The results show that the polymer based filler materials are suitable for both compression and tensile loading situations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013

However, MICP research has never acknowledged the antifungal properties of calcite-forming bacteria (CFB). Since fungal colonization on concrete surfaces can trigger biodeterioration processes, fungi on concrete buildings have to be prevented. Therefore, to develop a microbial sealing agent that has antifungal properties to remediate cement cracks without deteriorative fungal colonization, we introduced an antifungal CFB isolated from oceanic islands (Dokdo islands, territory of South Korea, located at the edge of the East Sea in Korea.). The isolation of CFB was done using B4 or urea-CaCl2 media. Furthermore, antifungal assays were done using the pairing culture and disk diffusion methods. Five isolated CFB showed CaCO3 precipitation and antifungal activities against deteriorative fungal strains. Subsequently, five candidate bacteria were identified using 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Crack remediation, fungi growth inhibition, and water permeability reduction of antifungal CFB-treated cement surfaces were tested. All antifungal CFB showed crack remediation abilities, but only three strains (KNUC2100, 2103, and 2106) reduced the water permeability. Furthermore, these three strains showed fungi growth inhibition. This paper is the first application research of CFB that have antifungal activity, for an eco-friendly improvement of construction materials.",2013

Assessment of the CO2 emission and cost reduction performance of a low-carbon-emission concrete mix design using an optimal mix design system,Optimal mix design system; Concrete; CO2 emission; Cost; Reduction performance,GENETIC ALGORITHM,"The production of concrete, a major construction material, emits a large amount of CO2 from the material production stage, such as in the production of cement, aggregates, and admixtures, to the manufacturing stage, and it is expected that a reduction of CO2 emission will be required. Accordingly, a study on the assessment of the appropriate amount of CO2 emission in the concrete production is necessary. As a result, in environmentally developed countries, studies have been conducted on the production of low-CO2-emitting concrete, such as a low-carbon concrete procurement system, but studies on this topic have been insufficient in Korea. Therefore, this study evaluated the appropriateness and the reduction performance of the low-carbon-emission concrete (LCEC) mix design system and the deduced mix design results using an evolutionary algorithm (EA), the optimal mix design method, which minimizes the CO2 emission of the concrete mix design. This study established a mix design database from approximately 800 concrete mix designs with different strengths and used an EA to deduce the optimal mix design. When deducing the optimal mix design, we considered design variables, object functions, and constraint functions to develop the algorithm. Then, the appropriateness and reliability of the mix design deduced from the optimal LCEC mix design system, which in turn was developed by using the above algorithm, were evaluated. Additionally, case studies of current structures in Korea were divided into the actual concrete mix designs and the deduced optimal mix designs, which were compared to analyze the CO2 emissions. According to the case study of the concrete mix design deduced from this assessment system, the CO2 emissions of the optimal mix design compared to the actual mix design were reduced by 4 and 7% for 24 and 30 MPa concrete, respectively.

The method exhibits several advantages with respect to traditional techniques, which are outlined and described in this paper.",2013
Comparison of passive house construction types using analytic hierarchy process,Passive house; Building criteria; Analytic hierarchy process; Design tool; Construction,MODEL; PRODUCTS; CARBON,"In this study, in order to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the most common construction materials, different constructions types for passive houses, such as solid wood, wood-frame, aerated concrete, and brick, were compared with each other. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP), a widely used multi-criteria method, was applied to quantify the comparison. The analysis of different construction types based on quantifying different criteria for passive houses was performed on a case study. The AHP analysis revealed that the highest ranking criteria came into play here, notably well-being, the psychological aspect, and functionality in the wood construction considered as one of the most suitable options for passive houses. The AHP analysis can help professionals and future dwellers to make a reasonable choice on further optimizing and developing a particular aspect of the building process by giving them the possibility of comparing different alternatives on a common and comprehensive basis. In the light of the growing importance of energy-efficient building methods, it could be said that wood construction would play an increasingly important role in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Predicting the carbon footprint of urban stormwater infrastructure,Carbon; Stormwater; BMPs; SCMs; Carbon sequestration; Carbon footprint; Carbon emissions; Stormwater wetlands; Bioretention; Swales,UNITED-STATES; SEQUESTRATION; RUNOFF; GREEN; SOIL; CATCHMENT; SYSTEMS; ROOFS; COST,"Due to increased regulations concerning urban stormwater runoff, stormwater control measures (SCMs) such as bioretention, ponds, and constructed stormwater wetlands, are becoming a more common feature of urban and periurban landscapes. The water quality and hydrologic benefits of SCMs are generally well-documented, and planning tools are available to optimize water quality benefits with economic costs of SCM construction and maintenance. Given rising interest in and potential for regulation of carbon emissions, a planning tool that allows for estimation of carbon emissions associated with SCM construction and maintenance is also a relevant pursuit. The objective of this work was to present a framework by which carbon emissions attributable to SCMs and conveyances could be predicted. This method was then applied to present a comparison of the carbon footprint of eight common SCMs and three stormwater conveyance types. The carbon embodied in construction materials represented a prominent part of the carbon footprint for green roofs, permeable pavement, sand filters, rainwater harvesting systems, and reinforced concrete pipes while material transport and construction dominated that of bioretention systems, ponds, wetlands, level spreader-grassed filter strips and concrete-lined swales. Despite accounting for sequestration by vegetation in these systems, only stormwater wetlands and grassed swales were predicted to store more carbon than what was released through construction and maintenance.

Non-destructive evaluation of carbon nanofibre concrete,,NANO-PARTICLES; PROPAGATION; TRANSMISSION; SURFACE; FIBERS; NDE,"Concrete is the most widely manufactured construction material. The addition of carbon nanofibres (CNFs) to concrete has many advantages in terms of mechanical and electrical properties (e. g. higher strength, higher Young's modulus and improved fatigue resistance) and self-monitoring behaviour due to the high tensile strength and high conductivity. In this work, the pulse velocity method was used to characterise the properties of concrete containing CNFs. Concrete strength correlations between pulse velocity, electrical resistance variation and destructive tests were analysed for different mix proportions. The test results indicate that the compressive strength, pulse velocity and percentage reduction in electrical resistance while loading concrete containing CNF differ from those of plain concrete. Based on the pulse velocity results, a reasonable concentration of CNFs was determined for use in concrete, which not only enhances compressive strength, but also improves the electrical properties required for strain monitoring, damage evaluation and self-health monitoring of concrete.",2013
Capacity of unreinforced rammed earth walls subject to lateral wind force: elastic analysis versus ultimate strength analysis,Rammed earth; Weak concrete; Wind loading; Structural analysis,MASONRY WALLS; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; FRACTURE ENERGY; CONCRETE,"Cement-stabilized rammed earth walls are an increasingly common form of construction in certain parts of the world, bringing considerable potential to reduce the carbon footprints of buildings. However, there is relatively little advice to designers wishing to use these construction materials at present, as compared to established materials such as concrete. This paper discusses the use of two proposed analysis procedures to calculate the capacity of unreinforced cement-stabilized rammed earth walls to lateral wind force. The first is an elastic analysis while the second is an ultimate strength analysis where a cracked wall is studied as a rigid-body mechanism. The accuracy of each method is assessed against the results of an experimental programme conducted on different rammed earth walls showing the shortcomings of the ultimate strength analysis. A new method is proposed in which the fracture energy required to open the crack that leads to the failure mechanism is included, leading to much improved predictions. The parameters used in the revised ultimate strength analysis are critically discussed and compared to those found in the concrete and masonry literature.",2013
Study of Pressure and Curing Temperature in Reactive Powder Concretes (RPC) with different amounts of Metallic Microfibers,"Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC); Metallic Microfibers; Mechanical properties, Construction Materials",,"Reactive powder concrete (RPC) is one of the greatest breakthroughs in concrete technology, as it enables the manufacturing of thinner structures without passive reinforcement. That reduces the load in buildings and increases durability, especially in aggressive environments. The use of metallic microfibers is what provides the increase in tensile stress and the resulting elimination of reinforcements. However, it is also the most expensive material as well as the most difficult to obtain, which requires its maximum optimization. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the mechanical properties of the RPC with three amounts of metallic fibers, 1%, 3%, and 5% in volume in relation to the material total, after having deter-mined the best curing temperature and effectiveness of the confining pressure in the fresh state. The mechanical properties studied were the axial compressive strength, flexural strength, tensile strength by splitting tensile test, and capillary absorption. The results showed that the fibers have little influence on compressive strength, since there was only a small increase as the amount of fibers was increased. However, for tensile strengths, either flexural or by splitting tensile test, the incorporation of microfibers allowed a significant improvement, obtaining gains of 392% for the flexural strength for the 5%, reaching 59MPa, in comparison with the 0%, which was 12MPa. There was also a decrease in capillary absorption.",2013
Nanotechnology as a Preventive Engineering Solution to Highway Infrastructure Failures,Nanotechnology; Construction innovation; Materials; Sustainable transportation; Road pavement,CONCRETE WORLD; GAP,"This paper reports the results of research on the application of nanomaterials to improve the quality and durability of road infrastructure. The research investigated road transportation infrastructure failures and the feasibility of preventive engineering solutions using nanotechnology. Laboratory experiments were conducted on different treated and untreated Nigerian soil samples (laterite, clay, and black soils) to study the changes in their fundamental geotechnical properties. Common engineering standards were used for the experiments and results analysis. Laboratory tests showed that treated laterite and clay soils had improved the liquid limit, plastic limit, and shrinkage index, including hydrophobic properties. The California bearing ratio (CBR) improved by as much as 87-125%. However, the black soil sample only passed the hydrophobicity test. The black soil did not exhibit any bearing strength in the CBR test, even after treatment with the nanomaterial. The paper contributes to understanding how nanomaterials can be used to engineer construction materials (laterite and clay soils), used in road pavements, and alter their normal geotechnical properties. This construction innovation results in improved performance characteristics. The paper also makes a pedagogical contribution by discussing the basic science and reaction chemistry that underpin material transformation processes and performance enhancement. This contributes to construction engineering practice and durable, economic, and sustainable highway infrastructure.

Physicochemical, radiological characterization, and modeling of exhalation rates were carried out in phosphogypsum (PG) and PG-SPC samples. Because the PG is enriched in several natural radionucleides, a leaching study in PG-SPC was performed. The optimized ratio of elemental and phosphogypsum dosage = 10-40% by weight was obtained. The result showed that the solidified materials present a highest strength (54-62MPa) and low total porosity (2.8-6.8%). The activity concentration index () in the PG-SPC is lower than the reference values in most international regulations; therefore these new sulfur polymer cements can be used without radiological restrictions in the manufacture of building materials inside a standard room () with good ventilation. The leaching experiment demonstrated that the environmental impacts of the PG-SPC cements are negligible. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2013

Recent developments in various areas of nanotechnology show significant promise in addressing many of these challenges. Research and developments have demonstrated that the application of nanotechnology can improve the performance of traditional construction materials, such as concrete and steel. Noteworthy improvements in concrete strength, durability and sustainability are being achieved with considered use of metal/metal oxide nanoparticles and engineered nanoparticles (carbon nanotubes and carbon nano-fibres), and environment-responsive anticorrosion coatings formed using nanoencapsulation techniques are showing promise in laboratory settings. Developments in nanotechnology are also improving the accuracy and commercial viability of sensor-based structural health monitoring; a task rapidly gaining importance as the structures that comprise many countries' most expensive investments near the end of their design life. As energy usage worldwide continues to grow, a focus on the potential for nanotechnology developments to reduce energy consumption has become evident. Research demonstrates that nanotechnology can contribute to novel cooling systems, and improve the functionality of solar cells and insulation.

High production of fly ash represents extreme hazard for environment. Question of storage of this waste material is disclosed. Recycling and reapplication of fly ash in construction materials industry is only economic solution for ongoing problem. Fly ash can be used as a component in cement, mortar, concrete, bricks, and tiles. In this study, characterization of three different Serbian fly ash capacities was used as base for further fly ash utilization possibilities investigation. Investigation of fly ash mineralogical components as well as chemical composition analysis was emphasized. Macroperformance was correlated to the microstructure of fly ash studied by means of XRD and SEM analysis. Furthermore, thermal stability of crystalline phases, content of trace elements, physico-chemical characteristics, and leaching toxicity were tested. Highlight was placed on the determination of the influence of the fly ash grain-size and its microstructure on the performances of the fly-ash-based products.

Effect of two different sources and washing treatment on the properties of UFS by-products for mortar and concrete production,Foundry sands; Industrial waste; By-product utilization; Recycling; Construction materials; Mortars; Concretes; Leaching,WASTE FOUNDRY-SAND; RECYCLED MATERIALS; STRENGTH,"The possibility of reusing two types of Used Foundry Sands (UFSs), coming from two different processing stages of the same foundry, in the production of mortars and concretes for structural applications was investigated. The UFSs were physically and chemically characterized and then added to mortars and concretes as fine aggregate replacement at increasing dosages (ranging from 0% to 30% by weight). Different water-cement ratios w/c as well as the addition of previously washed UFSs were also considered. The resulting washing waters were used to manufacture cement pastes in order to investigate the effect of soluble UFSs ions on the hydration kinetics of cement. Leaching tests in de-ionized water were realized in order to assess the environmental impact of the final materials. The main results show that UFS properties are very dependent on their source, even in the same foundry. The reduction in compressive strength is greater when lower w/c are adopted. High content of soluble alkaline ions in UFS can induce an accelerating effect in cement hydration. However, if previously washed UFS is employed, the accelerating effect at shorter curing time is eliminated and the reduction in mechanical performance at longer curing timepartially recovered. The release in de-ionized water satisfies the enforced standard for all the specimens. At these percentages of use, mortars and concrete for structural applications can still be manufactured and the use in construction is beneficial over disposal. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Durability and leaching behavior of mine tailings-based geopolymer bricks,Mine tailings; Geopolymer; Bricks; Durability; Heavy metals; Leaching kinetics,FLY-ASH; INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; PORTLAND-CEMENT; TRACE-ELEMENTS; HEAVY-METALS; WASTE MUD; STABILIZATION; IMMOBILIZATION; TECHNOLOGY; CONCRETE,"Disposal of mine tailings (MT) in impoundments may have adverse environmental impacts such as air pollution from dust emissions and release of heavy metals to surface and underground water. Geopolymerization as an environmentally-friendly and sustainable method has been used to stabilize MT so that they can be used as construction material. In this paper, the durability and leaching behavior of MT-based geopolymer bricks are studied by measuring unconfined compression strength (UCS), water absorption, weight loss, and concentration of heavy metals after immersion in pH = 4 and 7 solutions for different periods of time. Microscopic/spectroscopic techniques, SEM, XRD and FTIR, are also employed to investigate the change in microstructure and phase composition of MT-based geopolymer bricks after immersion in the solutions. To describe the leaching behavior of MT-based geopolymer bricks, the first order reaction/diffusion model (FRDM) is used to analyze the leaching test data. The results indicate that although there is a substantial strength loss after immersion in pH = 4 and 7 solutions, the water absorption and weight loss are small. The strength loss is mainly due to the dissolution of geopolymer gels as indicated by the microscopic/spectroscopic analysis results. The leaching analyses show that the heavy metals are effectively immobilized in the MT-based geopolymer bricks, which is attributed to the incorporation of heavy metals in the geopolymer network. The FRDM can satisfactorily describe the leaching behavior of heavy metals in the MT-based geopolymer bricks and the analysis results indicate that the solubility or reaction rate is an important factor controlling the leaching behavior.

Two jute fiber reinforced concretes, called jute fiber reinforced normal strength concrete (JFRNSC) and jute fiber-reinforced high-fluidity concrete (JFRHFC), were tested in compression, flexure and splitting tension. Compressive, flexural and splitting tensile strengths of specimens were investigated to four levels of jute fiber contents by volume fraction. From the test results, Jute fiber can be successfully used for normal strength concrete (NSC) and high-fluidity concrete (HFC). Particularly, HFC with jute fibers shows relatively higher improvement of strength property than that of normal strength concrete.",2013
Evaluation of thermal conductivity for thermally insulated concretes,Thermal conductivity; Insulation; Lightweight aggregate; Glass bubble; Insulated concrete,HEAT; AIR,"Passive energy-saving houses and buildings made of thermally insulated materials become popular in recent construction practices to address the demanding energy needs and to reduce the consumption of hydrocarbon energy resources. Thermally insulated concretes represent alternative construction materials to improve the thermal efficiency in a wide range of residential and commercial buildings. This study presents the experimental results of thermal conductivity values of lightweight concrete materials at ambient temperature conditions. Various lightweight aggregates and glass bubbles are selected as surrogates and replacement materials for coarse aggregates in order to reduce the thermal conduction in concretes. The linear and plane heat source methods are implemented to quantitatively obtain conductivity values for tested specimens. Results highlight that the thermal conductivity of concretes can be effectively reduced with increasing fraction of lightweight aggregates critically depending on the type of lightweight aggregates, thereby playing an important role in the thermal insulation. The addition of micro-meter sized hollow glass bubbles further decreases the thermal conductivity of specimens while its impact is less pronounced than the lightweight aggregates. The measurement of strength corroborates the soundness of mechanical applicability of tested concretes specimens as well. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2013
Affordable construction towards sustainable buildings: review on embodied energy in building materials,,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; EMISSIONS; UK; TECHNOLOGIES; CONCRETE; BAMBOO; NEED; CO2,"Affordable construction has identified low embodied energy in materials as key issue. This review paper shows that even though there is a lack of research on this topic, embodied energy and carbon are studied in the context of buildings and construction materials. Moreover, comparison between studies is not possible due to the different assumptions used by the researchers, due to the fact that most studies are focused in a given location, and also due to the great variation between data presented in the embodied energy databases available. This paper shows different studies published in scientific journal papers and carried out around the world on the accounting of embodied energy in building materials. The paper includes the boundary of each of this study, including the location, type of material or building studied, and the conclusions found. Moreover, the paper discusses the definition of embodied energy and the significance of this concept in buildings.",2013

Review of mechanical properties of short fibre reinforced geopolymer composites,Fibres; Mechanical properties; Geopolymer; Composite,STRAIN-HARDENING BEHAVIOR; FLY-ASH; CEMENTITIOUS COMPOSITES; EXTRUSION; MORTARS,"Concrete exhibits brittle behaviour due to its low tensile strength. The addition of fibres, either short or continuous, changes its brittle behaviour to ductile or quasi-ductile with significant improvement in tensile strength, tensile strain, toughness and energy absorption capacities. The binder in the fibre reinforced cement composites (FRCCs) is mainly Portland cement. The recent environmental awareness in construction industry promotes the use of alternative binders to partially or fully replace the cement as its production creates environmental pollution due to release of CO2 into atmosphere. Recent years have seen a great development in new types of inorganic cementitious binders called ""geopolymeric cement"" around the world. This prompted its use in concrete, which improves the greenness of ordinary concrete. Efforts have been made to replace the cement based binder in the current FRCC with ""geopolymeric"" binder resulting in fibre reinforced geopolymer composites (FRGCs), which is greener than the former one. The development of FRGC is relatively new in the field of construction materials. This paper presents the state-of-the-art development of short fibre reinforced FRGC and its mechanical properties with emphasis on compressive strength, tensile strength, flexural strength, impact strength and toughness capacities. The durability properties of FRGC are also discussed in this paper. The recent development on ductile fibre reinforced geopolymer composites (DFRGCs) exhibiting deflection hardening and multiple cracking behaviour in flexure is also presented here.

Experimental tests and a numerical simulation are performed in the scope of this work. The main conclusion of this study is that due to the strong scale effect related to the tensile and bending creep behaviours of a standard concrete mix design, it is not possible to simulate numerically (with classical Kelvin-Voigt chains) the bending creep behaviour of that type of concrete knowing the compressive and tensile creep behaviours obtained using the specimen geometries normally used in laboratories.",2013
Behaviour of concrete in a stress continuity region after cracking under restrained drying shrinkage,shrinkage; uniaxial restrained specimen; stress continuity region; bond analysis; effective tensile Young's modulus; building materials; construction materials; testing; experiments; general,,"Some studies have investigated the time-dependent characteristic of concrete for predicting stress under restrained shrinkage. However, these studies investigated the shrinkage behaviour of concrete in restrained conditions before cracking, and no study has yet investigated the behaviour of concrete due to restrained shrinkage in the stress continuity region after cracking. Therefore, this study investigates the shrinkage behaviour of concrete in the stress continuity region after cracking in uniaxial restrained specimens and analyses the restrained tensile stress of concrete in this region by way of a bond analysis. The results show that the effective tensile Young's modulus considering tensile creep is approx. 22-26% of the static modulus of elasticity. Moreover, the analytical results of the restrained tensile stress of concrete considering the effective tensile Young's modulus were in accordance with the experimental results.",2013
Crack healing of cementitious materials using shrinkable polymer tendons,crack closure; autogenous healing; durability; polymer tendons; building materials; construction materials; testing; experiments; design and construction,CONCRETE; TEMPERATURE; MICROSTRUCTURE; PERMEABILITY; HYDRATION,"This paper presents an experimental study on autogenous healing in a recently developed shrinkable polymer cementitious material system. Small-scale hollow prismatic mortar beams with unbonded shrinkable polymer tendons were loaded until a crack of predefined width had formed. The specimens were then subjected to a range of combined heating/curing regimes to activate the shrinkable polymer and to promote autogenous healing of the cementitious material prior to reloading to failure. Upon reloading, specimens loaded with the shrinkable polymer tendons remaining after heating and curing achieved between 120 and 195% of their initial peak loads, whereas specimens tested with the shrinkable polymer tendons removed after the heating and curing stages recovered on average 80% of their initial peak loads. The overall conclusion was that, provided a supply of water is present and sufficient heat is applied for polymer activation, the material system is effective at not only closing cracks and applying a prestress, but also at enhancing the self-healing of cracks in cementitious materials.",2013
Development of a mix design methodology for high-performance geopolymer mortars,Geopolymer mortar; Fly ash; mix design; Compressive strength; general; building materials; construction materials; analysis and design methods,FLY-ASH; TECHNOLOGY; CONCRETE,"This paper presents the development of a mix design method for geopolymer mortar mixes with a principal focus on compressive strength. The method is based on the hypothesis that the overall strength of geopolymer mortar depends on the strength of the geopolymer binder materials, the packing density of the aggregates in the mortar and the amount of geopolymer binder. First, the strength of the binder was evaluated experimentally. Fly ash obtained from two different sources and ground granulated blast-furnace slag were used as the main ingredients in the production of the geopolymer binder. Correlation between the packing density of the aggregates in the mortar and their influence on the binder demand and compressive strength were investigated. Finally, a conceptual framework for a geopolymer mortar mix design approach is proposed. In addition to describing the mortar mix design methodology in a rational way, it is hypothesized that the approach can also be extended to the development of a geopolymer concrete mix.",2013
Residual compressive and flexural strength of a recycled aggregate concrete following elevated temperatures,recycled aggregate concrete (RAC); recycled coarse aggregates (RCAs); residual compressive strength; residual flexural strength; elevated temperature; building materials; construction materials; testing; experiments; fire protection,PERFORMANCE,"A recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) with different replacement percentages of recycled coarse aggregates (RCAs) (i.e. 0, 30, 50, 70, 100%) was investigated experimentally at elevated temperatures. The residual compressive strength as well as the residual flexural strength of the RAC following elevated temperatures was studied and evaluated. A relationship between the residual compressive flexural strength of RAC and the elevated temperature was proposed. Furthermore, the relationship between the residual flexural strength and the compressive strength of the RAC was compared and analysed. It was found that both the residual compressive strength and the residual flexural strength of the RAC decrease with a rise in temperature, and the effect of the RCAs replacement percentage on the residual flexural strength and the residual compressive strength of RAC was found to be obvious.",2013
Characterisation of concrete and mortar cracking by digital image correlation and acoustic emission,cracked; mortar; concrete; characterisation; digital image correlation; acoustic emission,FRACTURE PROCESSES; DAMAGE MECHANISMS; TENSILE TESTS; DIMENSIONS; COMPOSITE; PATTERNS; SIGNALS; SIZE,"Cracks and defects in construction materials can cause an increase in their moisture permeability, and accentuate their degradation. In order to accurately assess the durability and the overall performance of building facades, one must dispose of a reliable method for the identification of the damage state of such materials. The present work aims at developing a methodology for the detection and monitoring of damage and fractures in building materials. Digital image correlation and acoustic emission monitoring were simultaneously performed during tensile loading tests of fibre-reinforced mortar samples. The optical technique was found able to reveal all ranges of cracks, from microscopic to macroscopic, and an image-processing procedure was conducted as to quantify their evolution in the course of the degradation of the samples. It was also found that the acoustic activity could be related to the optical measurements in terms of damage quantification and localisation.",2013
Deformability design of high-performance concrete beams,beams; curvature; deformability; high-performance materials; high-strength concrete; high-strength steel,PLASTIC ROTATION CAPACITY; STRESS-STRAIN MODEL; FLEXURAL DUCTILITY; CEMENTITIOUS MATERIALS; SEISMIC PERFORMANCE; BUILDING STRUCTURES; CONFINED CONCRETE; PACKING DENSITY; NORMAL-STRENGTH; COUPLING BEAMS,"The use of high-performance materials (HPMs) such as high-strength concrete (HSC) and high-strength steel (HSS) is becoming more popular in the construction of beams and columns of tall buildings. These HPMs not only increase the stiffness and decrease the strength-to-weight ratio, but also provide a more sustainable construction method by minimising the construction materials needed. However, HSC and HSS are more brittle than normal-strength concrete and steel, respectively. Therefore, it will adversely affect the deformability of concrete beams. To evaluate the pros and cons of adopting HPM in beam design, the author will investigate the flexural strength and deformability of concrete beams made of HPMs. The deformability in this study is expressed in normalised rotation capacity and investigated by a parametric study using nonlinear momentcurvature analysis taking into account the degree of reinforcement, confining pressure, concrete and steel yield strength. From the results, it is evident that the deformability of concrete beams increases as the degree of reinforcement decreases or confining pressure increases. However, the effects of concrete and steel yield strength depend on other factors. For practical design purpose, charts and formulas are produced for designing high-performance concrete beams to meet with specified flexural strength and deformability requirement.

Condition Assessment of Civil Infrastructure in Europe: Recent Developments and What Might Be Ahead,NDT; Condition assessment; Civil engineering; Probabilistic fracture mechanics; Concrete; pipelines,GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR,"Infrastructure is subject to continuous aging. This has given life-cycle management of the infrastructure an increasing role. Therefore, reliable inspection and monitoring tools are in increasing demand. The paper provides a short overview of the major activities in this area in Europe, followed by a presentation of current projects in the field of civil engineering in which topics related to combinations of nondestructive testing (NDT) methods and modular control and data acquisition approaches are discussed. In this paper, the two major construction materials in civil engineering, steel and concrete, are discussed. Regarding reinforced as well as prestressed concrete, a combination of various NDT methods is often required, which allow reliable results for material characterization, flaw detection, and the determination of component-specific geometry parameters. Therefore, a multisensor measurement approach with a high degree of automation is required. Two recently developed measurement devices (OSSCAR and BetoScan) will be described. Regarding steel constructions, an example from the field of pipeline inspection is shown where the combination of NDT with fracture mechanical assessment is directly possible. Both fields deliver the required interfaces in which the fracture risk is evaluated in probabilistic terms. Therefore, this procedure can be used as a tool for inspection-based lifetime conceptions. The paper concludes with an outlook on future trends for degradation monitoring. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000317. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2013
Influence of concrete fracture on the rain infiltration and thermal performance of building facades,Heat; Moisture; Modelling; Building material; Fracture,THICKNESS INTERFACE ELEMENTS; POROUS-MEDIA; FINITE-ELEMENTS; HEAT-TRANSFER; MOISTURE; DAMAGE; FLOW; SIMULATION; PARTITION; TRANSPORT,"Water infiltration is known to play an important part in the degradation process of construction materials. Over time, microscopic and macroscopic cracks progressively develop under the effects of mechanical loading and sorption/desorption cycles: their influence is to be accounted for in long-term hygrothermal performance assessments of the building envelope. The present work aims at showing the potential consequences of cracking on the heat and moisture transfer across building facades, in order to justify the need for the identification of damage to prevent durability and thermal issues. Specific simulation cases of insulated and non-insulated building facades were defined, and submitted to atmospheric boundary conditions for simulation times of one month. Some of the simulation geometries included previous measurements of crack patterns in concrete. The comparison of fractured and non-fractured building facades showed the effects of cracks on the moisture accumulation and thermal performance of these wall configurations, thus giving an estimate of what these effects might be in real conditions. A methodology is thus proposed for the identification of renovation needs, which may be applied for the purpose of durability assessments as well. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013
Utilization of recycle paper mill residue and rice husk ash in production of light weight bricks,Recycle paper mill residue; Rice husk ash; Bricks; Light weight; Compressive strength,CONCRETE,"Resource recovery and utilization of industrial by-product materials for making construction material has gained significant attention across the world. In this research study, recycle paper mill residue (RPMR) and rice husk ash (RHA) are utilized to improve the properties of bricks. This research study evaluated the feasibility of utilizing RPMR and RHA for making construction bricks. A homogeneous mixture of RPMR-RHA-cement was prepared with varying amount of RHA (10-20% by weight) and RPMR (70-80% by weight) and tested in accordance with the IS codes. Characterization of RPMR and RHA was performed using XRF, TG-DTA, XRD and SEM techniques. The SEM monographs show that RPMR has a porous and fibrous structure. The TG-DTA characterization demonstrated that RPMR can withstand temperatures up to 280 degrees C. The results indicate that RPMR-bricks prepared from RPMR-RHA-cement combination are light weight and meet compressive strength requirements of IS 1077-1992. This novel construction material serves objectives of resource recovery through prudent solid waste management. (C) 2013 Politechnika Wroclawska. Published by Elsevier Urban & Partner Sp. z o.o.

Decontamination of radionuclides on construction materials,Decontamination; Radionuclides; Sequestering agents; Gamma-spectroscopy,,"A wide variety of materials can become contaminated by radionuclides, either from a terrorist attack or an industrial or nuclear accident. The final disposition of these materials depends, in large part, on the effectiveness of decontamination measures. This study reports on investigations into the decontamination of a selection of building materials. The aim has been to find an effective, easy-to-use and inexpensive decontamination system for radionuclides of cesium and cobalt, considering both the chemical and physical nature of these potential contaminants. The basic method investigated was surface washing, due to its ease and simplicity. In the present study, a basic decontamination formulation was modified by adding isotope-specific sequestering agents, to enhance the removal of cesium(I) and cobalt(II) from such construction materials as concrete, marble, aluminum and painted steel. Spiking solutions contained Cs-134 or Co-60, which were prepared by neutron activation in the SLOWPOKE-2 nuclear reactor facility at the Royal Military College of Canada. Gamma spectroscopy was used to determine the decontamination efficiency. The results showed that the addition of sequestering agents generally improved the radiological decontamination. Although the washing of both cesium and cobalt from non-porous materials, such as aluminum and painted steel, achieved a 90-95 % removal, the decontamination of concrete and marble was more challenging, due to the porous nature of the materials. Nevertheless, the removal efficiency from 6-year-old concrete increased from 10 % to approximately 50 % for cobalt(II), and from 18 to 55 % for cesium(I), with the use of isotope binding agents, as opposed to a simple water wash.",2013
Dynamic behavior of porous concretes under drop weight impact testing,Porous concrete; Drop weight impact; Dynamic testing; Laser Doppler velocimetry,HIGH-STRAIN RATES; PROJECTILE IMPACT; RESISTANCE; HUGONIOT; VELOCITY; RELEASE,"Porous concrete is used as a construction material in various applications mainly as a permeable cementitious material. However, its response under impact loading is generally not considered. Due to the high percentage of its intentional meso-size air pores, porous concrete has a moderate static strength compared to normal concrete while its dynamic performance is distinctive. Owing to its characteristic of forming multiple cracks, it fractures into small fragments when exposed to impact loading. Therefore, with the aim of designing a special type of concrete to be used in protective structures, porous concrete was investigated. In this study, the impact strengths of different types of porous concretes were analyzed in correlation with their mixture compositions and production technique. The dynamic experiments were performed using a drop weight impact test set-up while the measurements were taken through Laser Doppler velocimetry. According to the results obtained, the aggregate properties and compactive effort, which are coupled to porosity, are the main factors that affect the dynamic performance of porous concrete.

Environmental analysis of a construction and demolition waste recycling plant in Portugal - Part I: Energy consumption and CO2 emissions,Construction and demolition recycling plant; Environmental impact; Recycling of construction materials,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; HOUSES; LCA; BUILDINGS; CONCRETE; IMPACT; MODEL; NEED,"This work is a part of a wider study involving the economic and environmental implications of managing construction and demolition waste (CDW), focused on the operation of a large scale CDW recycling plant. This plant, to be operated in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (including the Setubal peninsula), is analysed for a 60 year period, using primary energy consumption and CO(2)eq emission impact factors as environmental impact performance indicators. Simplified estimation methods are used to calculate industrial equipment incorporated, and the operation and transport related impacts. Material recycling - sorted materials sent to other industries, to act as input - is taken into account by discounting the impacts related to industrial processes no longer needed. This first part focuses on calculating the selected impact factors for a base case scenario (with a 350 tonnes/h installed capacity), while a sensitivity analysis is provided in part two. Overall, a 60 year global primary energy consumption of 71.4 thousand toe (tonne of oil equivalent) and a total CO(2)eq emission of 135.4 thousand tonnes are expected. Under this operating regime, around 563 thousand toe and 1465 thousand tonnes CO(2)eq could be prevented by replacing raw materials in several construction materials industries (e.g.: ferrous and non-ferrous metals, plastics, paper and cardboard).

Alkali-Activated Natural Pozzolan Concrete as New Construction Material,alkali-activated cementitious materials; geopolymer concrete; natural pozzolan; sustainable development,IMMOBILIZE TOXIC METALS; GEOPOLYMERIC MATERIALS; ENGINEERING PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; POTENTIAL USE,"In the near future, geopolymers or alkali-activated cementitious materials will be used as new high-performance construction materials of low environmental impact with a reasonable cost. This material is a good candidate to partially replace ordinary portland cement (OPC) in concrete as a major construction material that plays an outstanding role in the construction industry of different structures. Geopolymer materials are inorganic polymers based on alumina and silica units; they are synthesized from a wide range of dehydroxylated alumina-silicate powders condensed with alkaline silicate in a highly alkaline environment. Geopolymeric materials can be produced from a wide range of alumina-silica, including natural products such as natural pozzolan and metakaolin-or coproducts-such as fly ash (coal and lignite), oil fuel ash, blast furnace or steel slag, and silica fume and provide a route toward sustainable development. Using lesser amounts of calcium-based raw materials, lower manufacturing temperature, and lower amounts of fuel result in reduced carbon emissions for geopolymer cement manufacture up to 22 to 72% in comparison with portland cement. A study has been done by the authors to investigate the intrinsic nature of different types of Iranian natural pozzolans to determine the activators and methods that could be used to produce a geopolymer concrete based on alkali-activated natural pozzolan (AANP) and optimize mixture design. The mechanical behavior and durability of these types of geopolymer concrete were investigated and compared with normal OPC concrete mixtures cast by the authors and also reported in the literature. This paper summarizes the main conclusions of the research regarding pozzolanic activity, activator properties, engineering and durability properties, applications and evaluation of carbon footprint, and cost for AANP concrete.",2013
Alkali-silica reactivity of some common rock types. A global petrographic atlas,,DEFORMED GRANITIC-ROCKS; UNDULATORY EXTINCTION; CONCRETE AGGREGATE; QUARTZ; ASR; EXPANSION; PRODUCTS; TURKEY; ZONE,"The correct identification of potentially alkali-silica reactive aggregates is important for the prevention of alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete. Although a number of standards for assessment of concrete aggregate by petrography are available, distinction of potentially deleterious from innocuous rock types can be problematic. The application of geological nomenclature alone is insufficient, as the geological history and hence mineralogical texture of a given rock type may strongly influence its performance in concrete. One of the goals of RILEM TC 219-ACS is to develop a worldwide photo atlas as a guide for petrographers in the identification of the mineral compositions and textures that are characteristic of alkali-reactive rocks. The atlas is based on micrographs of rock types recognized as potentially deleterious by field performance and/or laboratory expansion testing. It is intended to serve as an independent reference work and aims to unify rock terminology so as to improve the petrographic characterization of aggregates. The mission of RILEM, the International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems and Structures (Reunion Internationale des Laboratoires et Experts des Materiaux), is to advance scientific knowledge in the field of construction.

Ten-year monitoring of high-rise building columns using long-gauge fiber optic sensors,,GPS,"A large-scale lifetime building monitoring program was implemented in Singapore in 2001. The monitoring aims of this unique program were to increase safety, verify performance, control quality, increase knowledge, optimize maintenance costs, and evaluate the condition of the structures after a hazardous event. The first instrumented building, which has now been monitored for more than ten years, is presented in this paper. The long-gauge fiber optic strain sensors were embedded in fresh concrete of ground-level columns, thus the monitoring started at the birth of both the construction material and the structure. Measurement sessions were performed during construction, upon completion of each new story and the roof, and after the construction, i.e., in-service. Based on results it was possible to follow and evaluate long-term behavior of the building through every stage of its life. The results of monitoring were analyzed at a local (column) and global (building) level. Over-dimensioning of one column was identified. Differential settlement of foundations was detected, localized, and its magnitude estimated. Post-tremor analysis was performed. Real long-term behavior of concrete columns was assessed. Finally, the long-term performance of the monitoring system was evaluated. The researched monitoring method, monitoring system, rich results gathered over approximately ten years, data analysis algorithms, and the conclusions on the structural behavior and health condition of the building based on monitoring are presented in this paper.",2013
Experimental investigations on coconut-fibre rope tensile strength and pullout from coconut fibre reinforced concrete,Coconut fibres; Rope; Concrete; Bond strength; Pre-treatment; Pullout test,BOND STRENGTH; POLYMER BARS; DURABILITY; REBARS,"The utilisation of coconut-fibre ropes as vertical reinforcement in mortar-free interlocking structures is under consideration for use in cost-effective earthquake-resistant housing. The walls are intended to be constructed with novel interlocking blocks, and coconut fibre reinforced concrete (CFRC) is used as a construction material (presented in a separate study). The rope anchorage is achieved by embedding it in the foundation and top tie-beams. The bond between the rope and the CFRC plays an important role, and the rope tensile strength is also significant in the overall stability of the proposed structure. The rope tension generated due to earthquake loading should be less than both the pullout force and the rope tensile load to avoid the structure collapse. As a pilot study, the scope of the current work is limited to the axial pullout behaviour and tensile capacity of the rope. Therefore, the bond strength between the rope and CFRC, and the energy required to pull out ropes from CFRC are investigated experimentally using rope pullout tests. The factors considered include rope embedment length, rope diameter, pre-treatment condition, concrete mix design ratio, fibre content and knot in the material matrix. The tensile strength and elongation of coconut-fibre ropes were determined considering the parameters of rope diameter and pre-treatment. To increase the pullout energy, bond strength and tensile strength of the rope, the boiling treatment was found to be beneficial compared to chemical treatment. The pullout energy increases with an increase in embedment length, rope diameter, cement and fibre content in the matrix. With the knowledge obtained, empirical equations are proposed to determine the pullout energy, bond strength and tensile strength of the rope. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013
Influence of Fungus on Properties of Concrete Made with Waste Foundry Sand,Compressive strength; Concrete; Microbes; Porosity; Waste treatment,BACTERIAL CARBONATE PRECIPITATION; CALCIUM-OXALATE; PRODUCTS; MINERALS; ROCKS; ACID,"Waste foundry sands (WFSs) represent the highest amount of solid wastes generated by foundries. The high cost of landfilling and the potential uses of waste foundry sand in construction purposes have prompted research into their beneficial reuse. Microbial modified mortar/concrete has become an important area of research for high-performance construction materials. This study investigates the effects of fungal (Eupenicillium crustaceum) treated waste foundry sand on concrete properties as partial replacements of sand. It shows an increase in compressive strength up to 24% and decreases in water absorption (44%) and porosity (50%) in concrete made with fungal treated 20% WFS after 28 days of curing, compared to untreated concrete made with 20% WFS. The strength improvement is attributable to microbially induced mineral formed by fungi, often referred to as calcified filaments, confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectra. The formation of calcium oxalate (weddellite) in urease broth by fungi was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. This ability of fungal culture to form the biomineral results in improvements to concrete properties. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000521. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",2013
Assessment of the consumption of water and construction materials in state-of-the-art fossil fuel power generation technologies involving CO2 capture,Power generation; Fossil fuels; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Water consumption; Plant construction materials,PLANT; CCS; OPTIMIZATION; STORAGE,"There is a growing concern about the impact of energy system decarbonisation on natural resources, such as raw materials and freshwater. Along this line, this paper assesses the needs for cooling water and construction materials of pulverised coal combustion (PF), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power generation technologies with and without CCS (Carbon capture and storage). Moreover, the paper evaluates how the integration of CCS technologies influences the economics and operational performance of power plants providing up-dated techno-economic indicators. Introduction of CO2 capture results in an increase of specific water consumption compared to a conventional plant which is more significant in the cases of PF and NGCC (56-62% and 50%) than in IGCC (9-12%). Therefore, the large scale deployment of CCS can have a significant impact on freshwater resources. The introduction of CO2 capture also increases significantly the amount of plant construction materials. The increase is up to 100% for concrete and steel and up to 27% for copper and polyethylene. The cost of construction materials is 8-15% of total investment costs, hence any changes in their prices can have a measurable impact on the cost of a plant and hence on the competitiveness of the underlying technology.

Recycled blocks with improved sound and fire insulation containing construction and demolition waste,Recycled aggregates; Construction and demolition waste; Fire resistance; Thermal conductivity; Sound absorption; Leaching,RESISTANCE CHARACTERISTICS; BOTTOM ASH; CONCRETE; AGGREGATE; PERFORMANCE; MANAGEMENT; MORTARS; GYPSUM,"The environmental problem posed by construction and demolition waste (C&D waste) is derived not only from the high volume produced, but also from its treatment and disposal. Treatment plants receive C&D waste which is then transformed into a recycled mixed aggregate. The byproduct is mainly used for low-value-added applications such as land escape restoration, despite the high quality of the aggregate. In the present work, the chemical composition properties and grading curve properties of these aggregates are defined. Furthermore, the resulting recycled concrete with a high proportion of recycled composition, from 20% to 100% replacement of fine and coarse aggregate, is characterized physically and mechanically. An environmental study of the new construction material when all aggregates are substituted by C&D waste shows a low toxicity level, similar to that of other construction materials. The new material also has improved properties with respect to standard concrete such as high fire resistance, good heat insulation, and acoustic insulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Polymer concrete with recycled PET: The influence of the addition of industrial waste on flammability,Polishing alumina; Recycling; Polymer concrete; Fly ash; Flammability,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYESTER RESIN; COMPOSITES,"The civil construction sector has found use for a range of industrial waste products in the form of substitutes that are as effective as standard construction materials but which have the bonus of providing an ecologically sound alternative for materials that would otherwise become an environmental concern. The use of waste materials in cement and polymer composites is a prime example of this practice. While composites with polymer matrices may display excellent mechanical properties, they must also offer superior flammability resistance. The main aim of this study is to develop innovative polymer concrete composites produced with industrial alumina waste, a by-product of the steel industry. The composites used unsaturated ortoftalic polyester as binder, river sand as aggregate and fly ash as filler. Different compositions of flame retardants were tested, one with polishing alumina (residue) and one with commercial grade alumina, and these were used in concentrations of 15%, 30%, 45% and 60% by weight of resin. The properties assessed were mechanical strength, fire propagation and SEM/EDS image analysis and the results underwent statistical analysis to check for their significance. The compositions with the addition of 60% flame retardant waste showed a reduction of 85% in flame propagation times when compared with the samples without the addition of fire retardants and this was accompanied by increased mechanical resistance. No significant difference was found for the two types of flame retardant in terms of flame propagation time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013

However, research on construction materials still is excessively focused on their mechanical properties with minor concerns regarding environmental considerations. In September of 2000 189 UN member states signed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in which the seventh goal is related to environmental sustainability. This is a cornerstone event of paramount significance. However, research in the field of the built environment especially on the field of construction materials still seems unable to recognize its importance. This paper provides some insights on future construction materials research priorities in the context of the seventh MDG. It reviews publication patterns on the field of construction materials highlighting investigations gaps and misdirected research lines. It addresses the importance of nano and biotech hot areas and briefly analyzes the gap between research and market use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013
Improvement of the compressive strength of mortar in the arid climates by valorization of dune sand and pneumatic waste metal fibers,Metal fiber; Dune sand; Pneumatic waste; Valorization; Compressive strength,STEEL FIBER; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; REINFORCED CONCRETE; WOOD SHAVINGS; PERFORMANCE; POWDER,"In this work we studied the effect of the addition of a new type of metal fibers, resulting from used tires, on the compressive strength of dune sand concrete. This formulation is a contribution to the valorization of the dune sand and used tires, in order to take part in the protection of the environment and reduction of the costs of construction materials. Three types of fibers were tested, having 30, 40 and 60 mm lengths, and diameters of 0.9, 0.28 and 0.9 mm respectively. The fiber volume fraction in the concrete was 1% and 1.5%. The results obtained show an improvement of the compressive strength for the metal fiber reinforced sand dune concrete (MFSC) compared to the concrete without fibers. The improvement of the compressive strength of the MFSC mixtures is governed by the size, fiber volume fraction, the bond between fibers and the dune sand concrete, the aspect ratio, and fibers orientation. The maximum of compressive strength was obtained by the introduction of fiber having the highest aspect ratio. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013
Behaviour of short polymer-high strength concrete columns under eccentric compression,Polymer concrete; Hybrid columns; Eccentric compression,MODIFIED CEMENT; MODIFIED MORTARS,"Engineers have been looking for ways to combine two or more materials in order to take advantage of their strong features. This is how the hybrid materials were born. A very common type of such a construction material is the reinforced concrete. The present paper presents the results of the experimental and numerical investigations of the behaviour of short hybrid concrete columns subjected to short-time eccentric compression. The columns are made of high strength concrete, in the compression part, and polymer concrete located in the tensioned part. At the age of 28 days the columns were subjected to eccentric compression, with constant eccentricity. The influence of the second order effects, such as creep, was neglected. From the experimental results it can be concluded that the type of reinforcement can have a significant effect on the ultimate carrying capacity of the hybrid columns. The numerical simulations by means of non-linear finite element analysis are in good agreement with the experimental results. (c) 2012 Politechnika Wroclawska.

"Rheology, fiber dispersion, and robust properties of Engineered Cementitious Composites",Engineered Cementitious Composites; Rheology; Fiber dispersion; Tensile strain capacity; Marsh cone flow rate; Plastic viscosity,REINFORCED CONCRETE; INTEGRATED STRUCTURES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MATERIALS DESIGN; STEADY-STATE; PERFORMANCE; CRACKING; WORKABILITY; DUCTILITY; ELEMENTS,"The capability of processing robust Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) materials with consistent mechanical properties is crucial for gaining acceptance of this new construction material in various structural applications. ECC's tensile strain-hardening behavior and magnitude of tensile strain capacity are closely associated with fiber dispersion uniformity, which determines the fiber bridging strength, complementary energy, critical flaw size and degree of multiple-crack saturation. This study investigates the correlation between the rheological parameters of ECC mortar before adding PVA fibers, dispersion of PVA fibers, and ECC composite tensile properties. The correlation between Marsh cone flow rate and plastic viscosity was established for ECC mortar, justifying the use of the Marsh cone as a simple rheology measurement and control method before fibers are added. An optimal range of Marsh cone flow rate was found that led to improved fiber dispersion uniformity and more consistent tensile strain capacity in the composite. When coupled with the micromechanics based ingredient-tailoring methodology, this rheological control approach serves as an effective ECC fresh property design guide for achieving robust ECC composite hardening properties.",2013
Software for planning loose yards and designing concrete constructions for dairy farms in arid and semi-arid zones,Arid zones; Dairy farms; Loose yards; Mathematical modeling; Precision livestock farming,,"To plan and design dairy housing, several calculations should be made; this requires time and efforts, with the possibility of making mistakes. The objectives of this paper are to develop a tool to assist the designers in planning and designing dairy housing in arid and semi-arid zones, to save time and efforts, and to provide a new design Model. Two mathematical models were developed to plan and design corral systems and the required concrete constructions. Subsequently, an electronic spark map (decision tree) was developed for each mathematical model, and then the mathematical models were integrated into the electronic spark maps. Afterwards, C# (C Sharp) programming language was used to develop the software by integrating the electronic spark maps, and making the user interface. The developed software is able to plan and design the housing system (corrals system), specify corrals and house dimensions, and compute the required amounts of construction materials (iron rods, cement, sand, and gravels) to build the required concrete base. Furthermore, it calculates the capital investment and the fixed, variable, and total costs of the construction. Data of 6 dairy farms were used to validate the model, and to evaluate the software. The differences between actual and calculated values were determined, and the standard deviations were calculated. The coefficients of variation (COVs) range between 3% and 7%.",2013
Reduction Effect of Toxic Substances for Apartment Buildings with an Ecofriendly Pre-cast Composite Structural System,Pre-cast; Composite structural system; CO2 emissions; Cr6+ emissions; Apartment buildings,ENERGY EFFICIENCIES,"Concrete, one of the construction materials used for apartment buildings, emits some toxic substances including CO2 and chromium VI that are detrimental to occupants. This paper presents pre-cast composite beams with T-type steels at each end to reduce the use of concrete. The new structural system is developed to replace the bearing walls of conventional apartment buildings. The pre-cast composite beams of the new concept (which can be used for apartment buildings) provide similar floor depth while minimizing the use of concrete materials. The CO2 and chromium VI emissions estimated from apartment buildings constructed with bearing walls are compared with those from buildings designed with the proposed composite beams. The data obtained from the previous study of Hong et al. [Hong WK, Kim JM, Park SC, Lee SG, Kim SI, Yoon KJ, Kim HC, Kim JT: A new apartment construction technology with effective CO2 emission reduction capabilities: Energy Int J2010;35(6): 2639-2646; Hong WK, Park SC, Kim JM, Kim SI, Lee SG, Yune DY, Yoon TH, Ryoo BY: Development of structural composite hybrid systems and their application with regard to the reduction of CO2 emissions: Indoor Built Environ 2010; 19(1): 151-162] for the amount of concretematerial in the apartment buildings was used to estimate the amounts of CO2 and chromium VI emissions. The pre-cast composite beams of the new concept are believed to be an effective structural system to reduce the use of concrete material, which in turn reduces the amounts of the noxious materials, CO2 and chromium VI.

Nanotechnological improvement of structural materials - Impact on material performance and structural design,Nanotechnology; Structural materials; Smart concrete; Ultra-high performance concrete,,"Within the last decades, the performance of concrete has been significantly improved by applying different kinds of micro- and nanoparticles and by applying analytical methods from fundamental research disciplines that had not been used for construction materials before, e.g. atomic force microscopy. One prominent result is Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) with its steel-like compressive strength which allows for slender but nevertheless very long lasting and thus sustainable concrete structures. On top of that several research projects performed at the University of Kassel, which this contribution likes to review, aim at making concrete an impervious, ceramic-like, acid resistant multifunctional ""smart"" material with added values by further changing its nano- and microstructure and/or applying reactive coatings e.g. with the ability to degenerate air pollutants.

Quartz-titania composites for the photocatalytical modification of construction materials,Core-shell-particles; Quartz; Photocatalysis; NO-degradation; Sol-gel-method,SILICA; NANOPARTICLES; PARTICLES; TIO2,"In this paper the synthesis of photocatalytically modified core-shell composites is reported. The synthesis was realized by hydrolysis and condensation of tetrapropylorthotitanate on ground quartz, which is used as an additive in mortar and concrete. This allowed a controlled growth of titania layers on the particles with different thicknesses. The efficiency of the coating process was studied by interpretation of XRF results. The morphology of the composites was analyzed via SEM. Photoactivity of the particles was studied by analyzing the titania crystal phases of the shell (XRD) and calculating the photonic efficiency of NO-degradation measurements. Moreover methylene blue degradation was performed to reflect the self cleaning properties of the composite materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013
Improvement of cement-based mortars by application of photocatalytic active Ti-Zn-Al nanocomposites,Photocatalysis; Cement; Mortar; Layered double hydroxides,OXIDES; NANOTECHNOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; REMOVAL; ZINC,"Photocatalytic active TiO2 has been extensively applied in construction material science due to its ability to remove pollutants from material surfaces. New inorganic-inorganic nanocomposite photocatalyst based on layered double hydroxides (LDHs) associated to TiO2 were introduced in order to increase the compatibility of photocatalyst with cement-based mortars. Different materials were prepared and characterized: cement paste with Ti-Zn-Al powder, mortar with cement paste finishing layer containing Ti-Zn-Al LDH and mortar with Ti-Zn-Al coatings. Degradation of methylene blue under UV light was selected as photocatalytic test reaction. The correlation between surface properties and photocatalytic activity was analyzed. The synergetic effect between TiO2 and Zn-Al-LDH contributes to pronounced photocatalytic performances, improving at the same time mortar performances as an important indicator of the compatibility of photocatalyst with mortar. The photocatalyst introduction procedure influences the active sites surface concentration, giving preference to surface coating method. However, introduction of photocatalyst into the bulk, having lower photocatalytic activity, results in an overall more stable system for prolonged application. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Freeze-thaw durability of recycled concrete containing ceramic aggregate,Ceramic aggregate; Freeze-thaw; Durability; Recycled concrete; Microstructure damages,COARSE AGGREGATE; FROST-RESISTANCE; MICROSTRUCTURE; WASTE; BEHAVIOR; CYCLES; DAMAGE; TILES; PASTE,"Abrupt temperature change (freeze-thaw cycles) is one of the most damaging actions affecting concrete, inasmuch as it induces microcracking. The formation of this crack reduces the mechanical behaviour of the material, moreover increase the penetration of aggressive substances into the concrete matrix, reducing its durability and possibly leading to structural collapse. The present study explored the durability of concrete made with aggregate containing 20-25% ceramic sanitary ware industry waste, analysing the scaled surface, exploring aggregate/paste de-bonding and measuring the mean and maximum crack widths in both the paste and at the interfacial transition zone between paste-aggregate after 56 freeze-thaw cycles. The findings showed that concrete freeze-thaw resistance rose with rising recycled aggregate content. This better performance was due to the high mechanical quality of recycled concrete and the intrinsic properties of the new aggregate. Use of this waste as a construction material would yield substantial technical, economic and environmental benefits, in particular from the perspective of sustainable development.

Developing Forecasting Models for PFI Data in Sabah Region,forecast; price indices; construction; Private Financial Initiative; artificial neural network,NEURAL-NETWORKS,"One prominent phase of which due attention is required in the Malaysian Private Financial Initiative agenda is value for money, under which aspects like optimum efficiency and effectiveness of each expense have been well accomplished. In this paper, the main objective lies in approximating unitary charges or materials' price indices in each Malaysian territory. Here, the goal is to find out the best forecasting method that can best be adopted to calculate the unitary charges price indices of the construction industry in the Malaysian Sabah Region. The data of the unitary charges indices were monthly data from year 2005 to 2011 concerning a range of construction material price indices in Sabah. The data comprise the price indices of aggregate, sand, steel reinforcement, ready mix concrete, bricks and partition, roof material, floor and wall finishes, ceiling, plumbing materials, sanitary fittings, paint, glass, steel and metal sections, timber and plywood. The concluding part of this paper suggests that the backpropagation neural network with linear transfer function was proven to establish results that are the most accurate and dependable for estimating unitary charges price indices in Sabah based on the Root Mean Squared Errors, where both the estimation and evaluation set values were roughly zero and highly significant at p < 0.01. Therefore, the artificial neural network is regarded as adequate for construction materials price indices' forecast in Sabah, and this lends itself as a great contribution for realizing the economy-related national vision, that is harmonious with the Malaysian National Key Economic Areas.",2013
The Local Material Practice and Time Spirit of Ningbo Museum Architecture,tile walls; concrete walls with bamboo splints formwork; the way of nature; Ningbo Museum,,"The rapid urbanization process in China is seeing the constant emergence of new towns, giant buildings, complex urban transport systems and massive infrastructure construction that are all inseparable from the construction system of the western architecture. This resulted into the increasing convergence of the appearance of China's fast developing cities. The traditional architectural culture of China is experiencing the most severe test ever. Therefore, how to enhance the values of national architectural culture, explore and inherit the local construction materials with adjustment to regional conditions and revive the construction skills are gathering overriding importance. Nowadays, new architectural ideas are constantly springing up and how architects deal with the appropriate relationship between traditional and modern styles becomes a problem worth pondering on. This paper takes Ningbo Museum building-a magnum opus of the 2012 Pritzker Prize for Architecture laureate Wang Shu, as an example, trying to do research into the regional building techniques, namely the ""tile walls"" and ""concrete walls with bamboo splints formwork"" in an effort to interpret the local materials practices of Ningbo Museum building as well as the time spirit contained in the process of building construction. The impact from economic globalization increasingly blurs national boundaries. Meanwhile, under the background of China's high-speed urbanization construction, new western architectural styles and construction technologies are being constantly introduced to and quickly adopted in every large construction field, whereas the Chinese traditional architectural culture with a large number of indigenous cultural heritages are fading away rapidly. Our cities are undergoing unprecedented changes and they are also seeing a messy coexistence of new and old city buildings which undermines city look. The urbanization in China today is steadily carried out and it has given rise to a discussion as to whether the construction of buildings should be anchored in tradition or geared only to future development. With his own architectural practice and persistent efforts, architect Wang Shu managed to negotiate many difficulties and presented the world such a beautiful artistic work. Ningbo Museum is one of the representative works of Wang Shu. He took the regional geographical environment as the source of design inspiration, started from the way of nature, human geography as well as landscape poetics, and emphasized the aesthetic characteristics of an harmonious integration of architecture and nature. Ningbo Museum is a powerful architectural practice which is nourished by the nutrition from the traditional culture in Ningbo with due respect for characteristics of regional culture. This paper is trying to do research into the regional building techniques, namely the ""tile walls"" and ""concrete walls with bamboo splints formwork"" in an effort to interpret the local materials practices of Ningbo Museum building as well as the time spirit contained in the process of building construction.",2013
REHABILITATION OF A CONCRETE DRY-DOCK,,,"This article addresses the challenging and interesting aspects of the rehabilitation of a concrete dry-dock. The aforementioned structure is located in a harsh corrosive environment which promotes deterioration seriously and it was constructed around 35 years ago. Moreover, most of the exposed structural elements are subjected to intermittent wetting and drying conditions which are ideal for corrosion. Thus, the majority of the exposed parts of the structure are seriously suffered concrete deterioration caused by corrosion of reinforcing steels. Furthermore, due to the progressive nature of concrete deterioration, the devastating consequences and costs associated with delaying repairs can be significant. Unfortunately, this deterioration is often addressed with marginal repairs that perpetuate ""the repair of the repair"" cycle. Thus, a variety of state-of-the-art concrete repair technologies with high-performance construction materials and protection systems, are employed to implement cost-effective repair programs. These repair programs not only can extend service life of the structure but also protect the value of the high initial investment associated with the construction of that prominent structure.",2013
Building Blocks Production with Sludge,Alternative materials; Construction materials; Sludge,,"The conventional water treatment generates a residue - sludge - which must be properly disposed. There are many ways residue disposal, with for example, landfilling, incineration and reuse of sludge in construction.

Several studies have been developed using sludge in exchange for raw materials used in proportions that do not alter the properties of concrete. This study evaluates the incorporation of sludge in concrete used to manufacture concrete blocks. Were studied three compositions for the manufacture of concrete blocks such as: Trace 1 (reference),dash 2: by replacing 10% of the mass of cement by the dry sludge and dash 3: by replacing 20% of the mass of cement by the dry sludge.

Effects of Consumption of Cement in Mechanical Properties of Lightweight Concrete containing Brazilian Expanded Clay,Alternative materials; Construction materials and components; Lightweight concrete; Expanded clay,,"Concrete is one of the oldest building materials known to humankind. From 1824, with the advent of Portland cement, concrete assumed a prominent place among the construction materials, due to large amounts of strength, durability and versatility it offered compared to other products, allowing the molding of various forms architectural. Until the early 80s, the concrete remained only as a mixture of cement, aggregates and water, however, in recent decades, due to the development of new techniques and products, the concrete has been undergoing constant changes.

IN SITU NON-DESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION OF TIMBER ELEMENTS,radiometry; non-destructive; timber structures; density; modulus of elasticity; acoustic method; penetration method,WOOD; DENSITY,"Structural timber is a traditional construction material. Timber structures belong to essential parts of almost all historical buildings, especially roof and ceiling structures. Their actual condition affects durability of the whole building, therefore it is necessary to check the conditions of the structure regularly and take care of possible undesirable changes. If these structures have historical value we have to use non-destructive or semi-destructive methods during this investigation. Penetration methods in combination with ultrasonic method are used nowadays [1]. Penetration devices are suitable to determine the density, surface and internal biological degradation, growth defects and moisture content of the element [2]. The density and the velocity of ultrasonic wave represent input information to derive dynamical modulus of elasticity. Penetration devices work on the principle of measuring the depth of penetration of a steel tip or on the principle of resistance drilling. Another method of determining the density of inbuilt element is the radial core. These methods are semi-destructive. It is the subject matter of the author's research to replace these penetration methods by radiometric measure of mass density. This method is based on the principle of gamma rays dispersion or on the principle of gamma rays absorption in a timber element. Radiometry as a measurement of density is often used for concrete constructions and asphalt pavement now. This measurement can be applied to the inbuilt elements, which is its a main advantage [3].",2013
An on-Going Monitoring Project of a New Timber Structure,Structural Health Monitoring; timber structures; in-service behavior; strain gages,,"Structural design, regardless of construction material, is based mainly on deterministic codes that partially take into account the real structural response under service and environmental conditions. This approach can lead to overdesigned (and expensive) structures. The differences between the designed and the real behaviors are usually due to service loads not taken into account during the design or simply to the natural degradation of materials properties with time. This is particularly true for wood, which is strongly influenced by service and environmental Conditions. Structural Health Monitoring can improve the knowledge of timber structures under service conditions, provide information on material aging and follow the degradation of the overall building performance with time. A long-term monitoring control has been planned on a three-floor structure composed by wooden trusses and composite concrete-wood slabs. The structure is located in Nantes, France, and it is the new extension to the Wood Science and Technology Academy (ESB). The main purpose of the monitoring is to follow the long-term structural response from a mechanical and energetic point of view, particularly during the first few service years. Both static and dynamic behavior is being followed through strain gages and accelerometers. The measurements will be further put into relation with the environmental changes, temperature and humidity in particular, and with the operational charges with the aim to improve the comprehension of long-term performances of wooden structures under service. The goal is to propose new improved and optimized methods to make timber constructions more efficient compared to other construction materials (masonry, concrete, steel). The paper will mainly focus on the criteria used to design the architecture of the monitoring system, the parameters to measure and the sensors to install. The first analyses of the measurements will be presented at the conference to have a feedback on the performance of the installed sensors and to start to define a general protocol for the Structural Health Monitoring of such type of timber structures.",2013

Performance of Lightweight Foamed Concrete With Replacement Of Concrete Sludge Aggregate As Coarse Aggregate,Concrete Sludge Aggregate; Foamed Concrete; Aggregate; Performance,,"The use of waste materials in construction industry is very essential in order to reduce the depletion of natural sources. Thus, this study is focused to determine the performance of lightweight foamed concrete made with concrete sludge aggregate (CSA) and to determine the optimum proportion of CSA that can gives optimum compressive strength. Strength is one of the most important properties of concrete since the first consideration in structural design is that the structural elements must be capable of carrying necessary loads. CSA has been use as partial substitution to normal coarse aggregate to manufacture structural lightweight foamed concrete. Two different sets of CSA proportion have been prepared with foamed injected through mixing processes. 25% and 50% of CSA for production of lightweight concrete were designed according to proper mix design. It is found that maximum percentage of CSA that contribute to the highest compressive strength of 25MPa is 50% of CSA replacement. Its density is 1837 kg/m(3) with water adsorption of 16.35%.

Study on the Suitability of Volcanic Amorphous Aluminosilicate Rocks (Per lite) for the Synthesis of Geopolymer-Based Concrete,geopolymer concrete; perlite; compressive strength,ALKALI-METALS; GEL FORMATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; CEMENT,"Geopolynnerization is a low-cost, low-energy-demanding, green technology that can transform a variety of silicate and aluminosilicate raw materials and industrial by-products into useful, high-added-value products. Because of their excellent mechanical properties, the use of geopolymeric materials for the replacement of traditional construction materials is gaining ground. The most commonly used raw materials for geopolynner synthesis include metakaolin, fly ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, and their mixtures. In this work, an amorphous aluminosilicate rock (perlite) was selected as a raw material in order to determine its utility in the synthesis of new Portland cementless binders for concrete. The effect of the following synthesis parameters on the development of the mechanical properties of the geopolynneric formulations were studied: the curing conditions (t=24, 48, 72h; T= 50 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 90 degrees C); the water/solid mass ratio (m(w)/m(s) = 0.28 to 0.37); the Si/AI molar ratio (5.6 to 6.5); and the alkali content and type of alkali ion (R/AI molar ratio = 0.65 to 1.05; R= Na or K). The structural changes were identified by means of x-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the mechanical properties were evaluated through compressive strength measurements. The most promising formulations were used for the synthesis of mortars using standard silica sand, according to ASTM C109/109C. Also in this case, compressive strength measurements were carried out while the structure was observed using XRD, FTIR, and SEM. The present study shows that perlite is a promising raw material for geopolymer synthesis, resulting in geopolymeric pastes with compressive strengths greater than 30 MPa. In contrast to the other raw materials currently used for geopolymerization, the geopolymerization of perlite requires a prolonged curing time of a total duration of 5 days at 70 degrees C.",2013

An Experimental Investigation On Flexural Behaviour Of Stainless Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete Beam Elements,Ductility; Steel Fiber; Load Carrying capacity; Energy absorption capacity,,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material because of its specialty of being cast into any desirable shape. Ductility and energy absorption capacity are the main requirements of earthquake resistant structures. However the conventional concrete has low tensile strength, lower energy absorption and little resistance to cracking. Therefore, it cannot fulfill the requirements of the earthquake or seismic resistant structure. Extensive researches have shown that the most significant influence of the inclusion of steel fiber in concrete is to delay and control tensile cracking of the composite material. The primary variables are fiber content and matrix composition. The addition of steel fiber to matrix leads to improvement in several properties of concrete. In this investigation the strength properties are determined by using different geometrical steel fibers. The various parameters like load carrying capacity, stiffness, ductility character and energy absorption capacity has to be analyzed.",2013
Discarded Tyre Rubber As Concrete Aggregate: A Possible Outlet For Used Tyres,solid waste management; used vehicle tyres; rubberised concrete properties,,"Discarded vehicle tyres constitute one important part of solid waste which had historically been disposed of into landfills. Recent EU policies on the Landfilling of Waste (Council Directive 1999/31/EC) have however put a ban on the landfilling of whole or shredded tyres, creating an imminent need to investigate any possible viable uses of this waste product. An emerging use is the production of concrete, in which tyre rubber particles partially replace natural aggregates. This has the additional advantage of saving in natural aggregates used in the production of concrete which are becoming increasingly scarce. This research investigated a wide range of physical and mechanical properties of concrete containing recycled tyre aggregates, to assess its suitability as a construction material. [1] The influence of factors such as rubber aggregate content and size, as well as curing time was also considered. The results showed that despite a great loss in strength, this type of concrete was acceptable for various applications requiring medium to low compressive strength. The quantities of concrete produced worldwide for such applications could ensure the viability of this product. Therefore, this type of concrete shows promise for becoming an additional sustainable solution for tyre rubber waste management.",2013

Consequently, the quantification of morphological characteristics of aggregates is essential for quality control of both aggregate production and pavement construction. Imaging techniques provide a cost-effective means for measuring the aggregate morphological characteristics conveniently without tedious work. However, these imaging techniques adopt various mathematical methods with different instrument setups and result in different definitions of morphological descriptors that are usually incomparable with each other. This paper evaluates prevalent imaging techniques used for aggregate morphological characteristics analysis, including equipment cost, repeatability, reliability, accuracy, and measured morphological parameters. Three imaging techniques (second-generation Aggregate Imaging Measurement System, first-generation University of Illinois aggregate image analyzer, and Fourier transform interferometer system), are further evaluated by comparing the analysis results of seven types of aggregates passing a 3/4-in. sieve and retained on a 1/2-in, sieve with manual measurements and visual rankings. Analysis of variance between measurements using different methods is also conducted to evaluate the accuracy of each aggregate imaging system. From the data analysis, recommendations that depend on morphological characteristics of most interest to engineers are made for the selection of appropriate imaging-analysis techniques.",2013

Influence of metakaolin on chemical resistance of concrete,,,"Nowadays the most suitable and widely used construction material is concrete. We could develop concrete for every request in connection with the properties of fresh concrete and the quality of hardened concrete, too. The demand is rising in application of special concretes, like high performance and ultra high performance concretes (HPC, UHPC). These are usable in extreme natural circumstances or in very corrosive surroundings (for example: sewage farm, sewer, cooling tower, biogas factories). The pH value of the commercial sewage is between 7-8, but this value is often around 4 or less. The concrete pipes, which transport the sewage, are under corrosion, because above the liquid level sulphuric acid occurs due to microbes. Acidic surroundings could start the corrosion of concrete. When the pH value reduces, the influence of the acids will increase. The most significant influence has the sulphuric acid. The pH value of sulphuric acid is about 1, or less. Earlier in the cooling towers of coal thermal power stations used special coating on the concrete wall. Recently application of high performance concrete without polymeric coating is more general. Cementitious supplementary materials are widely used to protect the concrete from these corrosive surroundings. Usually used cementitious supplementary materials are ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS), flying ash (FA) or silica fume (SF). In the last years there has been a growing interest in the application of metakaolin. Metakaolin is made by heat treatment, calcinations of a natural clay mineral, kaolinite. In our present research the chemical resistance of mortars in different corrosive surroundings (pH=1 sulphuric acid; pH=3 acetic acid) and the chloride ion migration were studied on series of mortar samples using rapid chloride migration test. Cement paste and mortar samples were made with 17% metakaolin replacement or without metakaolin. The following cements were used: CEM II/A-S 42.5 N, CEM I 42.5 N-S. We concluded that the replacement of cement by metakaolin results in significant increases in compressive and tensile strengths and it prevents the infiltration of harmful substances.",2013

A self-fabricated drop-weight impact test rig with a steel ball weight of 1.2 kg drop at 1 m height has been used in this research work. The main variables for the study is to find the relationship of the impact resistance against the amount of bamboo reinforcement and slab thickness. A linear relationship has been established between first and ultimate crack resistance against bamboo diameters and slab thickness by the experiment. The linear relationship has also been established between the service (first) crack and ultimate crack resistance against the bamboo reinforcement diameter for a constant spacing for various slab thickness using 0.45 OPS and 0.6 OPS bamboo reinforced concrete. The increment in bamboo diameter has more effect on the first crack resistance than the ultimate crack resistance. The linear relationship has also been established between the service (first) crack and ultimate crack resistance against the various slab thickness. Increment in slab thickness of the slab has more effect on the crack resistance as compare to the increment in the diameter of the bamboo reinforcement.,2013

Because of their ample use of cement, these projects have a significant environmental impact, including the production of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Rock-filled concrete (RFC) is an innovative dam construction method that promises better environmental performance than conventional concrete (CC) in the material production stage by saving a large amount of cement. However, the environmental loads throughout the entire life cycle of a dam must be quantified. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate the environmental loads in the lifetime of a dam and reveal the environmental impact of RFC relative to CC over the entire life cycle of a concrete dam. Through reviewing the limitations of the existing life-cycle assessment (LCA) models, a hybrid LCA model is applied to achieve this goal. The results from a case study of a concrete dam project in China are presented to demonstrate the environmental benefit of RFC throughout the lifetime of a dam. The results indicate that RFC reduces greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 64% and energy consumption by approximately 55% compared with CC. With regard to each life cycle stage, RFC decreased the CO2 emissions by 72% in material production, 25% in transportation, 51% in construction, and 15.6% in operation and maintenance. The conclusion is that RFC is more environmentally responsible throughout the life cycle of a dam's, and that the environmental benefit of RFC may help to encourage decision makers to select the appropriate methods in the planning phase.

Use of GIS for the development of digital structural integrity maps of high risk areas in Cyprus due to corrosion of steel reinforcement,GIS; risk area; steel corrosion; reinforced concrete,REBARS,"Concrete reinforced with steel rebars remains one of the most widely used construction materials. Despite its good mechanical performance and expected service life of at least 50 years, reinforced concrete is subjected to corrosion of the steel rebars which normally leads to concrete spalling, deterioration of the reinforced concrete's (RC) mechanical properties and eventual reduction of the structural load capacity. In Cyprus, especially in coastal regions where almost 60% of the population resides, many structural problems have been identified in RC structures, which are caused by the severe corrosion of steel rebars. Most RC, located in coastal areas, show signs of corrosion within the first 15-20 years of their service life and this affects their structural integrity and reliability, especially against seismic loading. This paper presents the research undertaken as part of the 'STEELCOR' project which aims to extensively evaluate the steel corrosion of RC buildings in coastal areas of Cyprus and conduct a risk assessment relating to steel corrosion. GIS are utilized in conjunction with non-destructive testing of corroded RC structures to develop a digital structural integrity map of Cyprus which shows the areas with high risk of steel corrosion of RC buildings.",2013

Production of concrete blocks with residues for civil construction,Alternative materials; Construction materials; components and blocks,,"The Construction is recognized as one of the most important activities for the economic and social development, and on the other hand, behaves also as a major generator of environmental impacts, either by consumption of natural resources, the modification of the landscape or the generation of construction and demolition waste(CDW). Investing in an implementation of managed clean and healthy in the area of CDW is essential for the environment and for the economy of the cities, who are spending less resources on the collection, cleaning of drains and treatment of diseases. Nowadays, the amount of waste generated is considered large, occupying much space in landfills, and its transportation, depending on the volume and weight, is quite expensive. Recycling and reuse of these wastes are extremely important to control and mitigate environmental problems, as well as produce various materials value-added. Over 90% of waste can be recycled, reused and transformed into aggregates with characteristics very similar to the original product, thus creating environmentally friendly products such as sand, gravel, pebbles. This research concerns the study of the properties of concrete containing CDW, aiming its use in the manufacture of concrete blocks to seal without structural function.

In our case, the aim was to develop a new construction material reaching the construction standards, --- i.e. with acceptable mechanical properties --- but which is also able to perform other functions such as thermal insulation or sound insulation. To do this, we chose to strengthen a cement mortar with natural fibers obtained from poultry feather. A physical and chemical stability behavior is obtained thanks to a treatment performed before their incorporation into the composite matrix. The fibers are introduced in a mortar matrix as a substitute for mineral or synthetic fibers which are traditionally used for this purpose.

The results of compressive strength showed that the composite achieved the minimum required strength for lightweight construction materials of 17.2 MPa. Scratch resistance measurements showed that the highest percentages loading of superhydrophilic particles (up to 2.5% of biomonomer weight) for LC's surface coating gave the highest scratch resistance while the uncoated sample showed the least resistances. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures revealed the difference between the surface roughness for LC with and without TOP coating. TOP is also formulated to provide self-cleaning LC surfaces based on two principal ways: (1) the development by coating the LC with a photocatalytic superhydrophilic, (2) if such a superhydrophilic is illuminated by light, the grease, dirt, and organic contaminants will be decomposed and can easily be swept away by rain.",2013

ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CONCRETE WITH CEMENT MANUFACTURED WITH ALTERNATIVE FUEL,concrete; cement; alternative fuels; leaching test; heavy metals,PORTLAND-CEMENT; CLINKER; WASTES; METALS,"A major environmental risk factor, associated with the use of construction materials, is their potential emission of pollutants and their migration in the aqueous medium (groundwater, surface water and precipitation). The paper aim is to evaluate the environmental properties of concrete with cement manufactured by using of the alternative fuel. Concrete matrix ability of heavy metals immobilization was assessed experimentally by appropriate leaching tests. Dynamic surface leaching test on monolithic concrete samples simulates release of contaminants from concrete products during service life. The potential leaching characteristics of the concrete after demolition were estimated by the extraction test, with assessment of the leaching availability (or the maximum leaching fraction). Also, there carried out the extractions at different values of pH for establishment the pH influence on heavy metals leaching. The emission values of heavy metals from monolithic concrete samples after 64 days were compared with the regulated, as according to Dutch Building Materials Decree (DMBD). The release values of the heavy metals from concrete were well below of the DMBD regulated criteria, referring to categoria I of construction materials. The extraction test results showed that pH plays a crucial role on the heavy metals leachability. The cationic contaminants (Mn, Ni, Co, and Cu) were leached at pH values < 7. The cations solubility is much lower than that of the oxyanionic in the alkaline aqueous medium of concrete pore with pH >= 12.5. The higher alkalinity of leachate provided from alkaline character of cement matrix was favorable to leach of Cr (VI), As (V), Sb (10 and V (V) as oxyanions. The experimental results obtained can be a contribution referring to assessing the environmentally friendly character of the concrete due cementitious matrix ability to heavy metals immobilization.",2013
Eco-Efficient Concrete Using Industrial Wastes: A Review,Eco-efficient concrete; sustainable construction; industrial wastes; Portland cement,LIFE-CYCLE; CEMENT; MORTARS; SUSTAINABILITY; AGGREGATE,"Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials in the world. However, the production of Portland cement as the essential constituent of concrete requires a considerable energy level. Also releases a significant amount of chemical carbon dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. Global demand will increase almost 200 % by 2050 from 2010 levels. Thus, seeking an eco-efficient and sustainable concrete may be one of the main roles that the construction industry should play in sustainable construction. Portland cement can be partially replaced by cementitious and pozzolanic materials, especially those of industry by-products such as fly ash, GOBS, silica fume, ceramic waste powder and metamorphic rock dust from stone cutting industry. The aggregates are also conserved by replacing them with recycled or waste materials (among which recycled concrete), ceramic waste, post-consumer glass, and recycled tires. All of the previous alternatives are, currently, the most used. This paper summarizes current knowledge about eco-efficient concrete, by reviewing previously published work.",2013
Environmental impact minimization of building facades by means of recycled material usage,Sustainable construction; recycled materials; environmental impact; economical impact; facade,CONSTRUCTION,"New recycled construction materials, developed by the authors among others, have been proposed in order to reduce the environmental and economical impact of the building facades. The model ""Quantification of resources consumed in construction"", by means of the bill of quantities which is based on the Andalusia Building Cost System, assesses the impact minimization. A real dwelling facade is analyzed, which is made of brick cladding and plasterboard, materials widely used in Andalusia, Spain. In the analysis these construction materials control the impact and are replaced by gypsum and concrete recycled panels, respectively. Finally the changes are evaluated by the quantification model, showing a significant reduction in the environmental and economical impact of the facade construction. The present work shows that the model ""Quantification of resources consumed in construction"" is sensible to changes in the construction materials.",2013

At present, reinforced concrete is the most prevalent construction material used in building structure Freezing-thawing cycle can be caused destruction of concrete are generally exhibit surface of osteoporosis, spalling, aggregate exposure, and even exposed steel bar etc. The concrete buildings in the cold area, especially those in the alternating wet and dry environment structure, such as dams, bridge, culvert, port engineering, often due to alternation of freezing-thawing cycles occur durability damage, can not meet the design service life. The concrete building in the environment of alternating positive and negative temperaturea, and internal containing more water, will occur freezing-thawing damage, so the freezng- thawing damage is the most representative indicator of concrete durability([1]).

It can be applied as a feasible repair material for structures subjected to fatigue load. In this paper, flexural fatigue tests on the composite beam constituted of an ultra-high toughness cementitious composite layer and a concrete layer with the same height (ultra-high toughness cementitious composite-concrete beam) are carried out. Then, on the basis of fatigue stress degradation models of concrete and ultra-high toughness cementitious composite, the fatigue process of ultra-high toughness cementitious composite-concrete beam is analyzed. It is shown that, the fatigue failure of ultra-high toughness cementitious composite-concrete beam in this paper is caused by the damage of ultra-high toughness cementitious composite layer. Therefore, with the flexural fatigue damage model of plain ultra-high toughness cementitious composite beam, the evolution curve of maximum tensile strain on the bottom surface of ultra-high toughness cementitious composite layer with the ratio of load cycles is calculated. The calculated strain is in good agreement with the experimental result. That is to say, the factual deformation, dependent on the fatigue stress level, can be predicted by the calculated result. As a result, the flexural fatigue damage model of ultra-high toughness cementitious composite can be applicable to evaluate the fatigue performance of ultra-high toughness cementitious composite-concrete beam.",2013
A methodology for estimating the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a residential building,Carbon efficiency; Carbon emission; Carbon dioxide; Residential building; Residential property value; Life-cycle assessment,ENERGY-EFFICIENCY; PROPERTY VALUE; EMISSIONS; CONSTRUCTION; IMPACT; CHINA; SCENARIOS; GAS,"Residential buildings account for a large share of global carbon emission, while they play important roles in economic growth and social development at the same time. Therefore, the appropriate evolution routes of residential buildings need balancing their carbon emission and value creation, which is realized in this paper by creating a new concept of life-cycle carbon efficiency and its relative methodology. First, the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a residential building is defined as the ratio of its life-cycle value to carbon emission, and the life-cycle of a residential building is divided into five stages, including construction materials preparation, building construction, building operation, building demolition, and construction & demolition wastes disposal. Second, the life-cycle carbon emission of a residential building is estimated through calculating the carbon emission at each stage based on its consumed energy and resources. Third, the product of the service life span of a residential building (in year), its building area (m(2)) and its storey height (m) is recommended to represent its life-cycle value, since this product is a physical measure and more useful to develop action plans to improve its performance. In the end, the proposed methodology is exemplified in estimating the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a five-storey brick-concrete residential building in Nanjing city (China) at its design phase. Possible measures to enhance the estimated carbon efficiency are further put forward, such as prolonging the service life span, enhancing 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) principles of cement and rolled steel, saving electricity and natural gas at the stage of building operation.

Micro-structural and metal leachate analysis of concrete made with fungal treated waste foundry sand,Concrete; Industrial waste; Fungi; Metal removal; Waste treatment; Waste foundry sand,ASPERGILLUS-NIGER; BY-PRODUCTS; SPECTROMETRY,"Waste foundry sand (WFS) is a byproduct of metal casting industry which results from the mold and core making processes. Land filling is not considered to be a good option because it leads to the risks associated with the environment as it generates leachate which may contain heavy metals and organic contaminants. Its beneficial use in construction materials results in reducing the cost of construction materials' ingredients and also helps in reducing disposal problem. Leaching characteristics are essential in understanding the environmental impact or toxicity, disposal and potential development of beneficial applications of WFS. This study aimed to presents micro-structural and metal analysis of fungal treated leachate obtained from concrete made with various percentages of WFS (0%, 10%, 15% and 20%). Metal concentrations of untreated and fungal treated leachate obtained from concrete made with WFS were analyzed for 15 metals including (Ba, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Hg, Li, Mo, Mg, Mn, Ni and Zn) by using ICP-MS and compared with world Health organization (WHO) standard limits and ground water quality standards (GWQSs). Metal analysis indicates that WFS contribute to the concentration of leachable metals in concrete containing WFS. Results show the reduction in the metal concentration in leachate obtained from fungal treated concrete. In fungus (Aspergillus niger) treated WFS (10%) containing concrete, the metal concentration in Cd, Cr, Fe, Mo, Mn, Ni and Pb were reduced to significant levels. Micro-structural analysis confirms the improvement of concrete by inclusion of fungal treated WFS in concrete due to the formation of calcium rich biomineral in the pores of concrete.

Artificial neural network for predicting drying shrinkage of concrete,Concrete; Drying shrinkage; Modelling; Prediction; Artificial neural network,DESIGN; CREEP,"Concrete is the most used construction material for a century. After casting and setting, concrete shows various dimensional physical and mechanical evolutions, of which drying. It is a physical process, having though mechanical consequences. Drying accompanies the hardening of concrete and leads to significant dimensional changes that appear as cracks. The advent or absence of cracking depends not only on the potential contraction but also on the extensibility of concrete, it' s strength (the cracking due to shrinkage appears only in case the tensile strength of concrete has been over passed by the stresses, induced by shrinkage deformations), and its degree of restraint to the deformation that may lead to cracking. These cracks influence the durability of the concrete works. This study presents the application of a nonparametric approach called Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in order to predict effectively dimensional variations due to drying shrinkage. Using this approach allows to develop models for predicting shrinkage. These models use a multi layer back propagation. They depend on a very large database of experimental results issued from literature (RILEM Data Bank), and an appropriate choice of architectures and learning processes. These models take into account the different parameters of concrete preservation and making which affect drying shrinkage of concrete as: Relative humidity (RH), Cure Period, volume to surface area ratio (V/S), water to cement ratio (W/C), and fine aggregate to total aggregate ratio or sand to total aggregate ratio (S/Ta). To validate these models, they are compared with parametric models as: B3, ACI 209, CEB and GL2000. In these comparisons, it appears that ANN approach describes correctly the evolution with time of drying shrinkage. A parametric study is also conducted to quantify the degree of influence of some the different parameters used in the developed neural network model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This represents a strange option from the construction industry since HPC offers several advantages over normal-strength concrete, namely, high strength and high durability. Therefore, HPC allows for concrete structures with less steel reinforcement and a longer service life, both of which are crucial issues in the eco-efficiency of construction materials. Although nanotechnology is a very hot issue the fact is that investigations on the field of concrete with nanoparticles are rare (100 in 10,000 Scopus concrete related articles published in the last decade). Actually, it remains to be seen how this research area will contribute to concrete eco-efficiency. This paper summarizes current knowledge on the field of concrete containing nanoparticles. It includes the influence of nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of concrete and on its durability. It also includes calcium leaching control. Moreover, the problem of efficient dispersion of nanoparticles is analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2013

The development of photocatalytic construction materials can contribute to clean the air and improve sustainability levels. Previous studies have focused mainly in cement and concrete materials, disregarding the potential application in historic buildings. In this work, a photocatalytic additive (titanium dioxide) was added to mortars prepared with aerial lime, cement and gypsum binders. The main goal was to study the way that microstructural changes affect the photocatalytic efficiency. The photocatalytic activity was determined using a reactor developed to assess the degradation rate with a common urban pollutant, NOR. The laboratory results show that all the compositions tested exhibited high photocatalytic efficiency. It was demonstrated that photocatalytic mortars can be applied in new and old buildings, because the nanoadditives do not compromise the mortar hardened state properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Introducing Sustainable Design Principles in Freshman Civil Engineering Design,,,"As issues dealing with sustainability are becoming more commonplace in industry, it is important for undergraduate students to become aware of how sustainability principles relate to their intended engineering major. By introducing sustainable design principles early in their academic career, students can apply these principles throughout the remainder of their higher-level courses. In a freshman introduction to design course, a more structured strategy to teaching sustainable design was implemented to incorporate sustainability principles early in the civil engineering curriculum. The purpose at this stage in student learning was to increase students' awareness of sustainable design through the introduction to sustainability concepts, such as the triple bottom line, life-cycle assessment, and carbon footprint, through discussion of concrete as a construction material and case studies of building construction. Pre- and post-surveys were conducted at the beginning and end of the quarter, respectively, to assess student learning. Results confirmed an increase in student awareness and understanding of sustainable design concepts that were incorporated on a weekly basis throughout the course and how they can be related to civil engineering projects.",2013

Evaluation and mix design for ternary blended high strength concrete,high strength concrete; mix design; cement replacement; metakaolin; redmud,SILICA FUME; METAKAOLIN,"Concrete has been the most widely used construction material for several years. Though conventional concrete (CC) performs very well under normal conditions, in special situations a very high compressive strength of concrete together with sustainability to aggressive environments is necessary. Hence, higher compressive strength of range more than 60 MPa is essential. So far, concrete mixes were designed only for strength and workability requirements. For the performance of long satisfactory life, the designed mixes should be checked and proved for their durability properties such as low permeability, high corrosion resistance, freezing and thawing resistance, fire resistance etc. This necessitates a detailed study on High strength concrete (HSC). This paper formulates a simplified mix design procedure for HSC by combining BIS and ACI code methods of mix design along with available literatures on HSC. Based on the above procedure M60 mix of ternary blended high strength concrete with different percentage replacement of cement by metakaolin (MK) and redmud (RM) is arrived at. These HSC mixes are tested experimentally for compression, split tension, flexure and workability. The performance of the designed mixes is very good and the results are reported in this paper.

PHYSICAL-CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF SOME INDUSTRIAL WASTES ARGUMENTS FOR THEIR USE IN THE FIELD OF BUILDING MATERIALS MANUFACTURING,coal ash; drilling sludge; metallurgical slag; recycling; building materials,COAL FLY-ASH; MINERAL COAL; CRYSTALLIZATION; GLASSES; CERAMICS,"This paper presents preliminary data on investigation and industrial application in building materials manufacturing of the use of major industrial waste as substitutes by up to 50% of natural classics raw materials which are obtained usually by destructive action on superficial soil layers: clay, sand, natural stone. The targeted wastes are: power plant ash (bottom ash), oil drilling sludge and slag from iron metallurgy (steel making in electric furnace). It have been investigated the physical-chemical characteristics relevant to their functionalization ability, the results confirming the compatibility with specific functional parameters of reference conventional technologies. The paper presents the results of general characteristics (chemical composition, density, grain size distribution) and high temperature microscopy, in which were determined: the sintering, melting and flowability temperature range, important characteristics for evaluating the maximum burning temperature of the obtained waste products (e.g., bricks and burned pellets). The results highlight that the ash of thermal power plant is similar to natural clay-limestone quartz sands extracted, and commonly used in many geographical areas of Romania for preparation of concrete with hydraulic hardening. Specific feature is the lower bulk density of approx. 25-30% compared to sand (easy aggregate according to EN 1097-3), where the ability to obtain lightweight concrete according to the EN 206-1 classification standard. In terms of chemical composition of ash from thermal power plant of Ceplea Valley it belongs to polynary oxide system SiO2 - Al2O3 - Fe2O3 - CaO, being in this respect quite similar to feldspathic limestone partially calcined clays (sub-burned firebrick): SiO2 (40-50%), Al2O3(16-21%), Fe2O3 (8-9%), CaO (9-14%), Na2O+K2O (1,5-3%), P.C. (5-12%). Oil drilling sludge resulting from drilling rock wells into Dacian and Pontian layers (800 - 1400 m depth) characteristic for Romanian Plain soil, are mainly composed of marls and clay marls, having thus compositional similarity and physical characteristics to sandy clays of surface exploitation that are used current for the production of construction materials. Although they are characterized by a low content of pure clay, drilling sludges can provide the necessary Pfefferkorn plasticity for a proper workability by pressing or ramming. Electric furnace slags have all the characteristics of a dense granular aggregate. Although they are different in terms of chemical composition of natural dense aggregates (crushed stone), these slags, due to their high thermodynamic stability afforded by processes originating (cooling of melts at over 1500 degrees C), are totally inert to interaction with classical binders used in building materials purposes, where the idea for their use as filler in the concretes or ramming masses composition. For the electric furnace slag the oxide chemical composition variation is in a much broader limit than those found in ashes: SiO2 (12-20%), Al3O3 (3-7%), Fe2O3 (25-38%), MgO (3-6 %), CaO (32-42%), MnO (5-8 %), Cr2O3 (0,5-1,4 %), SO3 (0,5-1%). The work is part of a series of concerns of authors on the rational use of raw material resources and conservation of the natural environment and especially to those who, through intense exploitation can cause irreversible changes in the eco-system.",2013
COST REDUCTION FOR SYMMETRIC STRUCTURES COMPARED TO PLAN IRREGULAR ONES,seismic behavior; nonlinear analysis; single-story structures; structural cost,,"Modern construction materials and building strategies offer a large variety of architectural conceptions the chance to become reality. Often architects and engineers choose irregular structural systems (in plan and elevation) for their design. This paper focuses on single-story plan irregular structures. Plan irregularity may come from an uneven distribution of mass or stiffness in the structural plan view. For unidirectional seismic loading, plan irregular structures experience a complex movement composed of translation and rotation, leading to supplementary displacements of the structural elements. This paper investigates the reduction of deformations in the structural elements of symmetric structures compared to plan irregular ones, which leads to lower costs for the structural system. Therefor two single-story plan irregular structures (twist restricted as well as twist unrestricted) subjected to a natural input and three spectrum compatible records, considering the design spectra of the Romanian Seismic Design Code and of the Eurocode 8 were analyzed by dynamic nonlinear analysis. The variation of the structural stiffness (eigen periods of 0,3s; 0,7s; 1,6s) and layout (quadratic and rectangular), of the corner period of the seismic input (0,5s; 0,7s; 1,6s) and of the earthquake intensity (from elastic behavior until a PGA of 0,4g) were taken into account for eccentricity values of up to +/- 20% from the plan dimension perpendicular to the direction of the seismic input. A total of 17712 cases were analyzed. Structural displacements and rotations were checked and cost reductions for structural elements were estimated, considering reinforced concrete as building material. The aim of this paper is to highlight the advantages of using simple (symmetric) architectural shapes for structures.",2013
NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF PHASE CHANGE MATERIAL COMPOSITE WALLBOARD IN A MULTI-LAYERED BUILDING ENVELOPE,,ENERGY-STORAGE; WALLS,"Residential buildings account for a large portion of total energy consumption in the United States. Residential energy usage can be dramatically reduced by improving the efficiency of building envelope systems. One such method is to incorporate thermally massive construction materials into the building envelope. This benefits building operation by reducing the energy requirement for maintaining thermal comfort, downsizing the AC/heating equipment, and shifting the peak load from the electrical grid. When impregnated or encapsulated into wallboard or concrete systems, phase change materials (PCMs) can greatly enhance their thermal energy storage capacity and effective thermal mass. In this work we numerically study the potential of PCM on energy saving for residential homes. For that purpose we solve the onedimensional, transient heat equation through the multi-layered building envelope, using the Crank-Nicolson discretization scheme. The latent heat storage of the PCM was accounted for with a phase fraction in a latent heat source term. Using this code we examine a PCM composite wallboard incorporated into the walls and roof of a typical residential building across various climate zones. The PCM performance was studied under all seasonal conditions using the latest typical meteorological year (TMY3) data for exterior boundary conditions. Comparisons were made between different PCM wallboard locations. Our work shows that there is an optimized location for PCM placement within building envelope surfaces dependent upon the resistance values between the PCM layer and the exterior boundary conditions. We further identified the energy savings potential by comparing the performance of the PCM wallboard against the performance of a building envelope without PCM. Our study shows that PCM composite wallboard can reduce the energy consumption in summer and winter and can shift the peak electricity load in the summer.",2013
LEACHING OF CALCIUM AND SILICON FROM CEMENT COMPOSITES IN SULPHATE ENVIRONMENT,corrosion; leaching; calcium; silicon,PASTES,"Concrete is a widely used construction material that is normally very durable, but in some aggressive environments it deteriorates and breaks down. The resistance of concrete depends on the type and pH of the aggressive environment as well as the chemical composition of the cement composite. One of the most aggressive environments is represented by sulphate aggressive media which exposition leads to sulphuric acid corrosion. Deterioration of concrete structures exposed to the aggressive solution is often characterized by the leaching of calcium and silicon compounds from the cement matrix. The paper presents the results of the leaching study of the main components of cement calcium and silicon from concrete samples of two mixtures (B and A) prepared considering the exposure classes for sulphate environment (XA1 and XA2). The concrete specimens were prepared from ordinary CEM I Portland cement in accordance to the standard manufacturing process. The concrete samples were exposed to the various liquid media: reference medium represented by fresh water, sulphuric acid with pH 3 and 4.2 and magnesium sulphate solution with the concentrations of 3g/L and 10 g/L, respectively. The experiments proceeded during 90 days under model laboratory conditions. The changes in the elemental concentrations of calcium and silicon in liquid leachates were measured by using X ray fluorescence method (XRF), pH changes were measured by pH meter. In addition, the changes in weight of the concrete samples were investigated. The highest concentrations of Si and Ca ions were measured in sulphuric acid solutions as assumed. The calculated Si/Ca ratios in leachates varied from 0.8 to 14.43 in dependence on the medium and concrete sample type. The higher resistance of A type samples prepared for moderately aggressive chemical environment (XA2) was not expressly confirmed by the experiment. The decrease in weight was observed for all investigated concrete samples after the experiments. The percentage of concrete samples weight losses varied from 0.81 to 1.82 %.",2013
INCORPORATING WASTE PAPER SLUDGE ASH AS PARTIAL CEMENT REPLACEMENT IN CONCRETE,low energy consumption construction materials; concrete; solid waste management,STRENGTH,"The disposal or potential recycling of paper mill sludge (a by-product of the de-inking and repulping of paper) constitutes a major economic and environmental problem for the paper and board industry. In the UK approximately 1 million tonnes of paper mill sludge are produced annually. Whilst the main alternatives to landfilling are the use of the sludge as a fuel and its land-spreading as agricultural fertiliser, further outlets for this waste (or by-product) material are needed. The presented research investigated the use of waste ash produced by the incineration of the paper mill sludge, as a partial Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) replacement for concrete production. OPC production is responsible for approximately 10 % of the global carbon dioxide emission caused by anthropogenic activity. Therefore the need to use alternative, less energy intensive cementitious materials for concrete is imminent. In the present study a series of tests were performed on concrete mixes in which OEM-I type cement was partially replaced by Paper Sludge Ash (PSA), in order to identify the best mixes that could also allow for the highest OPC replacements. Mixes were also made in which in addition to PSA other constituent binders such as Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS), or metakaolin were used to prevent potential deleterious reactions and the production of expansive products by consumption of CaO, leading to concrete unsoundness. The tests investigated a number of fresh and hardened concrete properties including workability, density, compressive and tensile strength as well as the soundness of the resulting cement. The results showed that the ash can partially replace OPC and that when used at modest OPC replacement levels it can actually improve the concrete strength compared to regular OEM-I concrete. It can therefore be concluded that the ash can be used to partially replace OPC with overall environmental advantages (discussed in the paper) and at the same time have a beneficial effect on properties of the resulting concrete.",2013
Research of Different Concrete Shrinkage Reducing Strategies Effectiveness,concrete; shrinkage; admixture; fibre; curing,POLYPROPYLENE FIBER; CRACKING; AGE,"Concrete and reinforced concrete is one of the most widely used construction material in hydraulic, civil, and transport engineering structures. These structures must have special durability, safety and longevity to avoid various accidents and failures, which have a negative effect to environment. One of the problem causing concrete and reinforced concrete deterioration is shrinkage, which cause internal structural defects and cracking. There are several strategies how to reduce shrinkage in concrete during hardening and to get crack-free concrete. The first strategy is to use special additives and admixtures (expansive, shrinkage reducing, fibres) and the second strategy is to use special concrete curing. Reviewing the scientific works it was not determined which strategy and which materials appling in different strategies is most effective. Therefore, it is important to compare different strategies and materials appling in different strategies for concrete shrinkage reduction. During the research four different materials were used to reduce the shrinkage of concrete (first strategy): expansive admixture (E), shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA),, polypropylene fibres (PPF), monofilament macro synthetic fibres (MMF) and one concrete curing material (P) (second strategy). All research tests were performed according to standard methods. In research were estimated that the best results on shrinkage deformations show shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA), concrete curing material (P) and expansive admixture (E).",2013
Reduction of Environmental Impact Using Timber Bridges on Forest Roads,timber; bridges; assessment; efficiency; GHG emissions,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; INDEX,"Timber represents a common used material in all the activities. There are references which attest its utilization as a construction material since the early known human history. Recent development solutions reintroduce the wood in construction by developing composite materials. The same fact applies to bridges and culverts, but the raw timber is still used, and, in some adequate conditions, the realized constructions present a long life expectancy. In Romania, forest roads are, in their majority, endowed with concrete bridges and culverts. Also, due to the well represented hydrography, their construction and maintaining represents a major cost component in the overall cost of the road. Most of them are no longer technically effective and represent a danger in the transportation activity, especially since the utilized means are realized for increased transport capacities. By comparison with traditional technical solutions (concrete bridges and culverts), timber may present a reduced life expectancy as a construction material. However, its availability at the construction site may compensate in the cost analysis. Also, there cannot be neglected the eco-efficiency of the construction when the timber is used as base material, especially in the context in which traditional concrete solutions are realized involving increased Green House Gases (GHG) emissions. In this context, in the paper are analyzed the existent and some proposed timber solutions for bridges and culverts - forest roads, with regard to the overall involved components with special focus on the costs and GHG emissions (CO2).",2013
"Employing Used Railway Ties for Retaining Walls Construction on Forest Roads - A Three Level Approach: Ecology, Economy and Technical Prescriptions",railway ties; retaining walls; recycling; economy; carbon emissions,,"Efficient utilization of the timber products from Romanian forests can be realized only through the existence of a well-developed forest roads network which to provide the optimum transportation cost parameters. In the actual conditions, with a forest roads density of only 6.5 m/hectare there appears to be necessary the construction of new forest roads, as well as the rehabilitation of the damaged existent ones. Due the fact that the forest resources from Romania are, in their majority, distributed in the increased slope mountainous conditions, the retaining walls are a well-represented constructions on the forest roads, involving in their realization a large amount of materials and logistics. Currently, the majority of the retaining walls are constructively realized from cast-in-place concrete or combined rock-concrete mixture. The concrete utilization involves high costs as well as increased Green House Gases (GHG) emission. By comparison, some more ecological and economical solutions may be used in the retaining walls construction, like the utilization of out-of-use railway ties, saving this way money, materials, and space. On the other hand, an important economy may be attained in the carbon cycle.

The great counterintuitive: Re-evaluating historic and contemporary building construction for earthquake collapse prevention,,,"This paper discusses a way of classifying the differences in construction typology of buildings from around the world and of all ages. This classification is intended to focus on building performance in earthquakes, with pre-modern as well as contemporary code conforming construction materials and systems. Instead of using the classic subdivisions found in most building codes which are organized around construction materials and structural systems, the author explores an organization of structural systems along a continuum from 'solid walls"" to 'frames,' with 'mixed-wall dominant' and 'mixed-frame dominant' in the middle. The discussion of this provides a platform for exploring different approaches towards the analysis of buildings that is more responsive to the inherent resilience of certain forms of archaic construction. This can also lead to the recognition of retrofit alternatives that utilize certain traditional masonry construction practices in more effective combination with steel and reinforced concrete than often has been seen in recent years, where such combinations have contributed to collapses.",2013
Confrontation between building and ground: notions of force and gravity in the work of Joao Vilanova Artigas,,,"Joao Vilanova Artigas (1915-1985) was one of the major thinkers of Brazilian architecture. Engineer and architect, he witnessed the intense industrialization process that took place in the city of Sao Paulo in the twentieth century. Focused on the rapid changing urban landscape and on the possibilities offered by new construction materials - especially reinforced concrete - his designs were mostly built of large and prismatic roofs supported by strongly oblique and sometimes slender structural elements. Although highly concerned with the physical properties of building materials and with the mechanics of structures, Vilanova Artigas also aimed at addressing the social context in which he lived. He believed that architecture could express the societal dramas of his time - especially the notion of struggle, which he intended to materialize through designs that dialectically opposed the force of gravity, thus revealing a confrontation between building and ground, artifact and nature.",2013
Arup calling: Engineering gets to Paris. Centre Pompidou (1971-77),,,"According to architecture critics, the enhancement of the role of the architects that were responsible for Centre Pompidou (Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers), from the competition to the inauguration, have not left much room for the issues regarding the role they actually played in the development of the design project and during the construction of the building. On the other hand, that may have been the competition recording the highest participation in the history of architecture, with 681 proposals, whose rhetorics, together with the following controversy on the effects of the ""maledifice"", have neither allowed historiography to reflect upon the winning designers' ""missions"" (actually these ""missions"" largely corresponded to cost control) and nor, even less, upon the close examination of the strategic role of engineering. In this context, engineering must be considered in terms of works and production costs organization and architecture management and as structural design: a designer's performance could be included in the ""structures and installations"" and ""coordination"" items. The construction of Centre Pompidou (1971-77) in Paris was the first great, entirely French, chance to test the efficiency of the Loi de la MaItrise d'Ouvrage Publique (1973), that somehow hosted the theoretical debate of the previous decade on the architect's cultural and social role. However, the structure and construction of the Centre Pompidou was the stage where the four most important market economies from 1950s to early 1970s could play a protagonist's role in terms of production possibilities: the UK, the U.S.A., Germany and Japan. Steel was chosen as the main construction material from the very beginning - with no exploratory survey. This paper, also concerning the above mentioned works, will especially focus on the documents by Ove Arup & Partners regarding the steel supply for the structure (and the offers by Mitsubishi Corporation, Nippon Steel, Krupp, Compagnie Francaise d'Entreprises Metalliques), the assembly of the structure and the analysis of possible fire protection systems, coming from the U.S.A. and Canada, to provide an alternative to the rock wool, concrete and chalk fibre coating; an accurate study on the degree of fire resistance of the structure and the facades - with DRAVEL double glazing - that was carried out by U.S. Steel Research Laboratory of Monroeville (Pennsylvania, USA) on behalf of architects Piano and Rogers and Ove Arup & Partners Research & Development Group. When was cast steel chosen? Who chose this material? If it can be used by applying a set of production techniques that were developed in the previous 15 years through the construction of offshore drilling platforms and nuclear industry, the will to employ this material for this specific architectural work also depended on the success of the covering of the Munich stadium by Gunter Benish and the Osaka Universal Exhibition (1970), with the Space Frame for the Festival Plaza with its cast sphere-shaped joints designed by Kenzo Tange with URTEC and the indian pavilion by Frei Otto. English Ted Happold (who, after a period spent in New York, started collaborating with Frei Otto and would become the chairman of the Construction Industry Council, among other things) with his experience in the design of lightweight tensile structures laid the foundations for a structure that was flexible enough even for the strictest fire protection norms that - in the meantime - would regard steel structures in France. This is a steel structure that was being defined as the designed project developed, thanks to the work by Peter Rice, director of the Ove Arup & Partners and who founded the Piano & Rice Associates since 1976; a system that consisted of superimposed steel frames with a 7 meters story height, where every frame is independent in terms of vertical loads; a system whose general stability was due to the combined stiffness of the columns, vertical wind bracing elements and horizontal slabs. A massive outdoor technical room was then joined to the structure, ""technical facade"" - 15 technicians have worked on it for 2 years. My contribution, starting from the documents kept at the Rpbw archive (Paris and Genoa) and at the Archives Nationales will try to tackle the design and, above all, the design and structure assembly coordination (a research topic that take into account and develop what has bee mentioned regarding 1973 law): Ove Arup with Peter Rice, chief design engineer, and with him Paul B. Ahm (Ove Arup senior partner), F.G. Clarck, E.L. Grut, structure engineers; Piano and Rogers with Shunji_Ishida and Bernard Plattner for the structures and installations on behalf of the entrusted designers. Happold (Structure 3, Ove Arup), fundamental in gathering the team that took part in the competition played a role that could not be easily confined since it was highly relevant. Gordon Cullen for the urban perspective was involved in the schematic design. Even the design had its own focal point: the structure. From the avant project to the project sommaire to the project definitive the work by architects Piano and Rogers defined every aspect of the Centre as the structure developed.",2013
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS OF BIG HOUSING ESTATES FROM THE SOCIALIST PERIOD,housing estates; multi-family buildings,,"Multi-family residential buildings, built in the socialist countries in the years 1960-1990 were not designed basing on the concept of sustainable development. Built under specific political and economic conditions, mainly in the concrete slab technology, using low-quality construction materials, full of technical defects resulting from the hasty construction process forced by the pressure of the authorities, they do not meet the expectations for the pattern of today's sustainable buildings. The only criterion for sustainability, which the large housing developments of the socialist period can be proud of is social sustainability, as the flats were settled and are today inhabited by social groups of different age, different level of education and with different incomes. Now, after the transition period, the buildings are subject to a number of works to adjust them to current legal requirements and new standards. Building owners and managers make an effort to raise their technical and functional quality, improve the external walls thermal insulation, replace worn out elements, reduce heating costs and power consumption, introduce new technologies to improve the environmental and economic parameters relating to the buildings. Surveys and studies were performed at the Faculty of Architecture of the Technical University of Silesia in the Polish-German interdisciplinary research project entitled: ""The past, present and future of Polish and German big housing estates. Comparative study of urban development models and their approval - examples of Katowice and Leipzig"". The group of sociologists and architects made a comparative study of the large housing estate in Leipzig-Grunau and three multi-family housing estates in Katowice. Using research tools: survey and in-depth interviews with residents, focus meetings with the settlements' designers, representatives of the local authorities and local actors that influence the investment process, as well as expert analysis of the buildings and surroundings, disadvantages, advantages and possibilities of development of settlements were examined thoroughly basing on the sustainable development triad of economics-ecology-society.",2013
Treatment of natural stones with Phase Change Materials: Experiments and computational approaches,Natural stone; Phase Change Materials; Thermal energy storage; Energy efficiency; Buildings,THERMAL-ENERGY STORAGE; PCM; BUILDINGS,"The treatment of natural stones with Phase Change Materials (PCMs) is experimentally and computationally investigated with respect to developing innovative products with thermal energy storage properties. The objective is to improve the thermal properties of natural stone by exploiting associated latent heat storage phenomena. As a consequence, natural stone treated with PCMs could be used as a construction material with the ability to store thermal energy leading to reduction of the overall buildings' energy consumption. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this concept, a series of experiments has been performed. At first, measurements were focused on the PCM influence at the natural stone thermal properties at sample scale. At product scale, a number of ""model"" concrete pilot houses have been constructed. The pilot houses were covered with trans-ventilated facade design using the Spanish ""Bateig azul"" natural stone. Two cases have been examined, with and without PCM integrated in the natural stone facade. Variations of indoor temperatures have been monitored for several day-night cycles showing that a smoother indoor temperature profile is obtained when PCMs are implemented. An improvement in human comfort and a reduction of energy consumption can thus be anticipated. Furthermore, a composite computational model based on the linking of TRNSYS platform to a MATLAB subroutine is introduced. The performance of the tool is evaluated with respect to the aforementioned measurements. It is shown that a good agreement between computational results and experimental data can be achieved. Parametric studies focused on the PCM influence, highlighting the advantages of the combined experimental and computational approaches. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012
Incorporating waste into an experimental school prototype: lessons regarding materials reclamation opportunities,Architecture; waste; reuse; recycle; school,DEMOLITION WASTE; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; REUSE; MANAGEMENT; BUILDINGS; BRICK,"This article presents lessons learned from a design project that explored the possibility of incorporating waste into the design of a school prototype. The authors worked with professional architects, a waste artist, environmental scientists and local waste operators to uncover new uses and applications for discarded items. As a result, bottles, aluminium cans, reclaimed doors, crushed concrete and second-hand bricks, etc. were identified, explored and integrated into the architectural design. This article serves as a catalyst that advocates the use of reclaimed materials in the field of design and planning. In particular, it highlights the challenges and issues that need to be addressed in carrying out design work with waste. Designers and practitioners interested in minimizing waste generation by proposing the use of reclaimed materials will find this article useful.",2012
Assessing the quality of sandstones for use as aggregate in concrete,,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STRENGTH CONCRETE; ROCK AGGREGATE; PERFORMANCE; DURABILITY,"Sandstones have been widely used as a source of concrete aggregates. Sandstones show a variety of textural, mineralogic and chemical characteristics that may affect their physico-mechanical properties as well as their use as a construction material. The aim of this paper is to assess the influence of the composition and texture of sandstones on aggregate properties. In this study, Ordovician sandstones were compared with Carboniferous, Devonian and Permo-Triassic sandstones used as concrete aggregates in Istanbul. The sandstone samples were tested to determine their petrographic, mineralogic and chemical characteristics and aggregate properties. Then, the testing concretes were prepared by using these aggregates, and hardened concrete properties were determined. According to the results obtained, although Ordovician sandstones have poor aggregate quality as compared to other sandstones, they were found to be suitable for use as coarse aggregate in low-strength concrete production.",2012
Closed-loop recycling of recycled concrete aggregates,Recycled concrete aggregate; Parent concrete; Concrete life cycle; Workability,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; MORTAR CONTENT; WASTE,"Reduce, reuse and recycle for environment recovery and respect are the key principles of a sustainable construction material. Much research has been conducted regarding the use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) in concrete mixes recycled from parent concrete of natural source aggregates, referred here as first generation. Recycling the RCA forming a second loop of recycling concrete is referred here as the second generation of RCA. This study concentrates on the properties of the second generation concrete. The concrete mixes considered in this study are conventional mixes made of 100% natural aggregates (NA), mixes containing up to 20% replacement of NA with RCA, producing first generation concrete and mixes containing up to 20% replacement of NA with aggregates obtained by recycling the first generation concrete (R-RCA), producing the second generation concrete. Properties that have been studied are workability, absorption, compressive and tensile strengths. The results show that the use of RCA and R-RCA has an adverse effect on concrete properties. Results show that the use of up to 20% replacement of NA by RCA or R-RCA instead of NA is allowed for producing concretes of accepted quality. The second generation RCA performed better than the first generation RCA. It is also shown that the closed-loop recycling is possible and advantages maintaining the sustainability of the natural resources and the environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Manufacturing of building bricks without Portland cement,Waste materials; Limestone powder; Fly ash; Silica fume; Masonry composite,FLY-ASH; SILICA FUME; ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; LIMESTONE POWDER; FIRED BRICKS; CONCRETE; MICROSTRUCTURE; STRENGTH; INDUSTRY,"European legislation about waste emissions and the need to reduce solid waste volume have caused scientists to invent new construction materials produced using waste materials. In this study, limestone powder, class C fly ash, silica fume and water are used without any other components in masonry brick production. Limestone powder, class C fly ash and silica fume were mixed, humidified, compacted and cured for periods of 7, 28 and 90 days. The compressive and flexural strengths, density, water absorption, porosity and thermal conductivity of the bricks were measured. The compressive and flexural strengths of the samples containing silica fume were found to increase significantly when the silica fume content in the mixtures was increased. At the 20% silica fume content, the compressive strengths of masonry blocks without Portland cement at the 28 and 90 days curing time, were 23 and 26.5 MPa. The estimated production cost of a new masonry brick was 6.4-times cheaper than that of traditional fired clay brick. The preliminary results were encouraging enough that these waste materials were used to produce a composite masonry brick without Portland cement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012
Multiscale simulations of concrete mechanical tests,Mori-Tanaka method; Concrete; Mortar; Virtual testing; Multiscale modeling; Coated inclusion,ELASTIC PROPERTIES; INCLUSION; MODEL,"In civil engineering, computational modeling is widely used in the design process at the structural level. In contrast to that, an automated support for the selection or design of construction materials is currently not available. Specification of material properties and model parameters has a strong influence on the results. Therefore, an uncoupled two-step approach is employed to provide relatively quick and reliable simulations of concrete (mortar) tests. First, the Mori-Tanaka method is utilized to include the majority of small aggregates and air voids. The strain incremental form of MT approach serves for the prediction of material properties subsequently used in the finite element simulations of mechanical tests. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Dynamic tensile behaviour of fibre reinforced concrete with spiral fibres,Fibre reinforced concrete; Spiral steel fibre; Dynamic split tensile test,STEEL FIBER; IMPACT; COMPOSITES; BOND,"This paper performs drop-weight splitting tests to study the dynamic tensile properties of fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) materials with different steel fibres. A renovated splitting tensile testing method was developed to ensure a more qualified experimental process. The splitting tensile impact tests were conducted with an instrumented drop-weight impact system consisting of a hard steel drop weight, a fast-response load cell, a high-speed video camera and a high-frequency data acquisition system. The quasi-static compressive and splitting tests were also conducted to obtain the static properties of the FRC materials. The commonly used hooked-end steel fibre and a new spiral shaped steel fibre were tested in this study. The high-speed video camera was used to capture the detailed failure process, deformation and cracking process of the tested specimens. Average strain rates and the cracking extension displacement and velocity under impact loading were estimated by analysing the recorded high-speed images. The strains were also measured by the strain gages on the specimen surface. The dynamic stress-strain and stress-COD (cracking opening displacement) relations, the rate sensitivity of tensile strength and the corresponding energy absorption capacity of plain concrete and FRC with different fibres were obtained, compared and discussed. The advantage and effectiveness of the new spiral fibre in increasing the performance of FRC under dynamic tensile loading were examined. The results show that FRC with spiral fibres outperforms that with hooked-end fibres, and is a promising construction material in resisting dynamic loadings. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Statistical Analysis of Concrete Compression Tests performed before 1972,,,"In order to perform structural assessments of existing structures based on current design concepts, characteristic values of the properties of older construction materials are required. However, regarding concrete, characteristic values based on quantiles of the statistical distribution of the property under consideration have not been used in Germany before 1972. Hence, the recently published German Structural Assessment Provisions for Older Road Bridges only contain safe estimates of the characteristic values of concrete compressive strength in between 1943 and 1972. This paper describes a first attempt on verifying these values based on real results from compression tests performed at the MPA of Technische Universitat Munchen at that time. For concrete grades B225, B300 and B450, a statistical analysis of these existing test results revealed 5%-quantiles of the concrete compressive strength in the order of the mean value of compressive strength required back then. Accordingly, the estimates of the characteristic values of concrete compressive strength given in the German Structural Assessment Provisions can be regarded as acceptable.",2012
Load capacity and crack development characteristics of HCWA-DSF high strength mortar ferrocement panels in flexure,Ferrocement technology; High calcium wood ash; Load-deflection response; Ultimate failure load; Deflection energy absorption to failure; High performance mortar,BIOMASS FLY-ASH; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SAWDUST ASH; CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR; DURABILITY; REPLACEMENT; CEMENT; WASTE,"In accordance to current technological advancements in the field of sustainable construction materials, high calcium wood ash (HCWA), a by-product from the biomass power generation sector, has been established as a highly viable supplementary binder material for the production of concrete and mortar. The research study was performed with the aim to investigate the effects of the inclusion of HCWA as a supplementary binder material. These effects were measured on the structural parametric response, crack development behaviour and ultimate failure mode of fabricated ferrocement flexural panels using HCWA mortar. Ferrocement flexural panels were subjected to four point flexural test till ultimate failure throughout the study. Mortars used in the fabrication of the ferrocement panels contained varying HCWA cement replacement levels from 2% to 10% by total binder weight. At the same time, all other experimental parameters of the ferrocement panels remained constant. The experimental results of 21 ferrocement panels indicated that the fabricated ferrocement panels fabricated with HCWA content up to 4% by binder weight exhibited superior structural performance as compared to the control ferrocement panels with no HCWA content. Structural performance parameters used for comparisons were the first crack load, ultimate failure load, deflection of energy absorbed to trigger ultimate failure, flexure stress-deflection response and flexure stress-concrete strain response. The number of cracks developed at failure was also taken into account with measurements of average crack width, crack spacing and failure mode. The inclusion of HCWA in the mortar within the ferrocement panels not only enhances the engineering performance of the panels but also contributes to potential binder material savings and resource conservation.

Monitoring moisture movements in building materials using X-ray attenuation: Influence of beam-hardening of polychromatic X-ray photon beams,Moisture content; X-ray; Attenuation coefficient; Porous media,SHRINKAGE-REDUCING ADMIXTURES; CEMENT PASTE; ABSORPTION; TRANSPORT; SYSTEM; TOMOGRAPHY; MORTARS; CRACKS,"X-ray attenuation measurements are commonly used as a non-destructive method to monitor internal concentration changes of moisture (i.e., moisture content) and other chemical compounds in porous building materials. The technique provides direct measurements of moisture content changes through analysis with a composite model consisting of a dry porous material and a thickness of water equivalent to the moisture content of the material. The current formulation of this composite model relies on certain assumptions, including a monochromatic X-ray photon beam source (i.e., X-ray photons of a single, consistent energy) and that interactions between the X-ray photons and the materials (water and porous material) are independent. However, X-ray sources typically used by researchers in this field of study produce X-ray photon beams over a spectrum of energy levels, or polychromatic X-ray photons. Implications of this inconsistency are introduced and discussed. This paper presents both an overview of fundamental descriptions of the X-ray attenuation measurement technique and results from a parametric experimental study of various porous construction materials, including calcium silicate board, aerated autoclaved concrete, clay brick, cementitious materials, and wood. Results from the parametric investigation indicate the attenuation coefficient of water is dependent on the type and thickness of the porous material. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Material characteristics of zeolite cement mortar,Natural zeolite; Alkali-activator; Compressive strength; High-functional construction material,ALKALI-ACTIVATED SLAG; SILICA FUME; STRENGTH; CONCRETE; ADMIXTURES,"The cement industry consumes large amounts of energy and uses limestone as a main raw material. The associated CO2 emissions are a main target of efforts to combat global warming and other environmental problems. With the advent of cutting-edge technology and increased public awareness of global environmental issues, the cement industry is actively seeking ways to diversify resources. This study was designed to assess the material properties of zeolite cement mortar that primarily consists of natural zeolite, which has recently drawn attention as an alternative cement material. We address strength properties and optimal mix proportions using an alkali activator (NaOH) instead of water (H2O) for preparing hardened zeolite mortar samples through alkali-activated reactions. The 7-day compressive strength of natural zeolite cement mortar was 43.5 MPa when optimal proportions of the alkali activator and curing temperature were applied. In the results of this study, zeolite cement has greater strength than existing normal Portland cement and has great potential to replace current construction materials.

Integrity of sulfur concrete subjected to simulated lunar temperature cycles,Sulfur; Sulfur concrete; Compression testing; Coefficient of thermal expansion; Lunar environment,,"In view of potential application as a construction material on the lunar surface the mechanical integrity of sulfur concrete was evaluated after being subjected to simulated temperature cycles. Here, small cubes of sulfur concrete were repeatedly cycled between room (20 degrees C) and liquid nitrogen (-191 degrees C) temperatures after which they, and non-cycled cubes, were evaluated by compression testing. The compression strength of the non-cycled samples averaged similar to 35 MPa (5076 psi) before failing whereas the cycled samples fractured at about 7 MPa (1015 psi). Microscopic examination of the fracture surfaces from the cycled samples showed clear de-bonding of the sulfur from the aggregate whereas it was seen adhering in those non-cycled. Based on a simple analysis it was concluded that the large strength discrepancy between cycled and non-cycled samples is due to differences between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials constituting the concrete.

Solid wastes encompass the heterogeneous mass of throwaways from the urban community as well as the homogeneous accumulations of agricultural, industrial and mineral wastes. Biomedical waste pose a significant impact on health and environment. A proper waste management system should be required to dispose hazardous biomedical waste and incineration should be the best available technology to reduce the volume of this hazardous waste. The incineration process destroys pathogens and reduces the waste volume and weight but leaves a solid material called biomedical waste ash as residue which increases the levels of heavy metals, inorganic salts and organic compounds in the environment. Disposal of biomedical waste ash in landfill may cause contamination of groundwater as metals are not destroyed during incineration. The limited space and the high cost for land disposal led to the development of recycling technologies and the reuse of ash in different systems. In order to minimize leaching of its hazardous components into the environment several studies confirmed the successful utilization of biomedical waste ash in agriculture and construction sector. This paper presents the overview on the beneficial use of ash in agriculture and construction materials and its leachate characteristics. This review also stressed on the need to further evaluate the leachate studies of the ashes and slag for their proper disposal and utilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012
LIGHTWEIGHT MORTARS WITH RICE HUSK: MIX DESIGN AND PROPERTIES EVALUATION,rice husk; agroindustrial waste; pretreatment; lightweight mortars,OIL PALM SHELL; COARSE AGGREGATE; CONCRETE,"In this paper the possibility of using the rice husk with and without pretreatment was analyzed, as an addition in the preparation of lightweight mortars. Various pretreatments of rice husk, such as washing with distilled water, acid solution bath for 24 h, basic solution bath for 24 h, and combinations and variations of the above pretreatments have been studied. Properties such as density, flexural and compressive strength of mortars have been tested. Finally, three selected mortars were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy technique. The results showed that mortars with very low density and high porosity were obtained, which make them candidates to produce construction materials for thermal and acoustic insulation, but not for manufacturing bearing elements due to their low mechanical strength. Conclusion are that the chemical treatment of husks with alkaline reagents and the addition of calcium chloride as the curing accelerator are two effective methods for the reuse of this waste in lightweight mortar.",2012
Patterns of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions in Building Structures,Building structures; construction material; emissions; moisture damage; principal component analysis; volatile organic compounds,PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNGAL DEVELOPMENT; HEALTH; SYMPTOMS; EXPOSURE; DAMPNESS; VOCS,"A new method for detecting hidden moisture damage was tested in a pilot study. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were sampled from within different building structures and the emission profiles were compared using principal component analysis (PCA). When all 60 samples were examined at the chemical group level (i.e. aldehydes, ketones, etc.), the samples separated into two major groups, representing concrete and wooden structures. Alcohols, terpenes, ketones, hydrocarbons, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and a group of unidentified compounds were more strongly associated with structures in which the predominant construction material was concrete, than in structures mainly made of wood. For the 20 samples from wooden structures, 8 chemical groups were more abundant in those sampled in moisture-damaged buildings than in those sampled in the building with no known damage. These were terpenes, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, furans, PAH and carboxylic acids. Emissions from moisture-damaged concrete structures were higher than from wooden ones but more chemical groups were emitted from moisture-damaged wooden structures. The results indicate that sampling and analyses of VOCs inside building structures, and using PCA for data analysis, are useful for finding chemical fingerprints for moisture damages but more data are needed to substantiate this.",2012
The unbound material. On the reception of the early reinforced concrete and its construction specificity,,,"The unbound material. On the reception of the early reinforced concrete and its construction specificity With the mass introduction of industrial construction materials such as iron and later, reinforced concrete, the existing relationship between materiality and the form which is developed out of it has been changing. Compared with previously used construction materials, the combination of concrete with iron provides much more capability, in almost unlimited forms and with much less structural restrictions. Thereby, however, old typological design concepts of shaping and joining have to first be overcome in lengthy disputes. The shift in the main focus of the designer from joining towards shaping reaches its high point in reinforced concrete: the cast building material disposes of the necessity of binding and can be shaped almost arbitrarily. It attains a substantial expansion of its structural and formal performance in the interaction of the iron specifically arranged to support it and the external formation of the components. For the first time, a building material can unite within itself the desired appearance and an actual structural effect that are decoupled from each other.",2012
"Static, dynamic mechanical properties and microstructure characteristics of ultra-high performance cementitious composites",cementitious composite; dynamic impact; mechanical properties; microstructure,FIBER-REINFORCED-CONCRETE; REACTIVE POWDER CONCRETE; HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; STEEL-FIBER; SILICA FUME,"A new type of construction material named ultra-high performance cementitious composite (UHPCC) was developed in order to reduce the production cost and energy consumption of reactive powder concrete (RPC). Six different mixture proportions of UHPCC were designed, and their properties, including workability (slump test), static mechanical properties (compressive strength and flexure strength), and dynamic mechanical properties (dynamic compressive strength, toughness and fracture pattern), were investigated. Finally, the microstructure of the UHPCC was studied. The experiment result indicate that the compressive and flexural strength of UHPCC can reach 150-200 MPa and 15-50 MPa under standard curing conditions, respectively, which is close to RPC200. Besides, the steel fiber has significant improvement on mechanical properties of UHPCC. The dynamic impact test results show that UHPCC has obvious strain rate effects. Besides, UHPCC exhibits excellent properties to resist dynamic impact. The microstructure investigation showed that UHPCC has dense microstructures and very strong bonds of the interfacial transition zone between cementitious paste and fine aggregate steel fiber.",2012

Design model for reinforcement corrosion,reinforcement corrosion; full-probabilistic modelling; durability design; building materials; construction materials; reinforcement; corrosion; design and construction,,"The performance-based durability design of reinforced concrete structures for corrosion of reinforcement is currently limited to the initiation period. That includes modelling the transport processes of chlorides and carbon dioxide into the concrete structure. Up to now, the subsequent time period after depassivation of the reinforcement, in which corrosion propagates, could not be modelled in a comparable manner. The task of the research project presented here, which was part of German Research Unit 537, was to develop a design model that enables a reinforced concrete structure to be designed against reinforcement corrosion for its entire service life. Therefore, a physically well-defined damage model for corrosion propagation was chosen as a basis. All system parameters in the damage model were investigated on the basis of numerical and laboratory studies carried out in the subprojects of the research unit. Statistical analysis allowed the simplification of the complex damage model into a user-friendly design model.

Improvements to the Eurocode 2 shrinkage model for concrete using a large experimental database,shrinkage strain; concrete; correction factor; experimental tests; Eurocode 2; building materials; construction materials; analysis and design methods; Eurocode,DRYING SHRINKAGE; CREEP; PROVISIONS; DESIGN,"Shrinkage plays an important, sometimes crucial, role in the design of many types of concrete structures as well as in their behaviour after construction. However, the uncontrolled strains are often larger than the expected values. As a matter of fact, there is as yet no perfectly satisfactory physical explanation for shrinkage. In this work, a large database has been set up for shrinkage testing performed by several research centres in Europe. On the basis of the statistical analysis of this database and by observing real structural behaviour, it becomes possible to investigate the current codes of practice regarding the computation of time-dependent shrinkage strains. As comparison with experimental tests has shown that predictions are often inaccurate, a correction factor is proposed in this work to improve the European Code, Eurocode 2, and lead to more satisfactory results.",2012

Influence of the reuse of OSB and marine plywood formworks on concrete surface aesthetics,Concrete; Aesthetics; Formwork; Color; Lightness; Reuse; Plywood; OSB; Wear; Alkali,,"Concrete surface quality is becoming increasingly important because demand for a high level of aesthetics has spread across a wide variety of construction works. Even though it is difficult to clearly define what represents ""beauty"" in construction materials, existing techniques may be used to quantify the aesthetic properties of concrete. As these properties depend mainly on the type of formwork used, this research project focuses on the reuse of two types of panel-plywood and OSB-and two types of release agent-vegetable oil and mineral oil. The evolution of the surface properties of the concrete was measured through lightness and absorption. For plywood formworks, a modification of surface quality was noticed after 80 reuses; for OSB panels, such changes were observed after only 50 reuses. For both types of formwork, the choice of release oil did not seem to have a major influence on formwork absorption. It was also observed that alkalis caused early degradation of the panels: the release agents were not always effective in avoiding this phenomenon. Finally, although reuse was found not to have any influence on the absorption capacity of the plywood formworks studied, this was not the case for the OSB formworks.",2012
Post-Damage Repair of Prestressed Concrete Girders,prestressed concrete; post-damage repair; shear strengthening; FRP; surface mounted rods,,"Concrete is an economical construction material and for that reason it is widely used in buildings and infrastructures. The use of deicing salts, expansion joint failure, and freeze-thaw cycles have led to concrete bridge girders experiencing corrosion of steel reinforcement and becoming unsafe for driving. The goal of this research is to assess the effectiveness of current and possible repair techniques for the end region of damaged prestressed concrete girders. To do this, three American Association of State Highway and Transportation prestressed concrete girders were tested to failure, repaired, and retested. Three different repair materials were tested including carbon fiber, glass fiber, and surface mounted rods. Each different repair material was also tested with and without injected epoxy. Comparisons were then made to determine if injecting epoxy had a positive effect on stiffness and strength recovery as well as which repair type regained the largest percentage of original strength.",2012
Marble waste as construction material - a diagnosis of the Laguna region,Marble waste; environmental impact; Laguna region,LIMESTONE FILLER; HIGH-VOLUME; CONCRETE; CEMENT,"The excessive consumption of natural resources and the increasing waste generated in most of the development activities have required establishing management systems and more efficient production, which will achieve a sustainable development process. Civil construction industry is one of the responsible for this progress, and as a consequence it has become one of the responsible for the accumulation of waste. This paper introduces the possibilities of using the waste from the manufacture of marble as filler for concrete production and as a basis for making bricks. The results show that it is of fundamental importance marble waste reuse to reduce the environmental impact in the Laguna region and indicates two possible solutions.",2012

Also, there is a risk of leaching even when fly ash is built in the construction composites. Fly ashes from various landfills were applied in several composite samples (mortar, concrete and brick) without any physical or thermal pre-treatment. The leachability of the potentially toxic pollutants from the fly ash based products was investigated. The leaching behavior and potential environmental impact of 11 potentially hazardous elements was tracked: Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, Hg, As, Ba, Sb and Se. A detailed study of physico-chemical characteristics of the fly ash, with an accent on trace elements and the chemical composition investigation is included. Physicochemical properties of fly ash were investigated by means of X-ray fluorescence, differential thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction methods. Scanning electron microscopy was used in microstructural analysis. The results show that most of the elements are more easily leachable from the fly ash in comparison with the.fly ash based composites. The leaching of investigated pollutants is within allowed range thus investigated fly ashes can be reused in construction materials production.",2012
Activity measurements of radon from construction materials,NORM; Rn-222; Construction materials; Track detectors; Alpha particles,BUILDING-MATERIALS; NATURAL RADIOACTIVITY; BY-PRODUCTS,"This work presents the results of radon concentration measurements of construction materials used in the Brazilian industry, such as clay (red) bricks and concrete blocks. The measurements focused on the detection of indoor radon activity during different construction stages and the analysis of radionuclides present in the construction materials. For this purpose, sealed chambers with internal dimensions of approximately 60 x 60 x 60 cm(3) were built within a protected and isolated laboratory environment, and stable air humidity and temperature levels were maintained. These chambers were also used for radon emanation reduction tests. The chambers were built in four major stages: (1) assembly of the walls using clay (red) bricks, concrete blocks, and mortar; (2) installation of plaster; (3) finishing of wall surface using lime; and (4) insulation of wall surface and finishing using paint. Radon measurements were performed using polycarbonate etched track detectors. By comparing the three layers applied to the masonry walls, it was concluded that only the last step (wall painting using acrylic varnish) reduced the radon emanation, by a factor of approximately 2. Samples of the construction materials (clay bricks and concrete blocks) were ground, homogenized, and subjected to gamma-ray spectrometry analysis to evaluate the activity concentrations of Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40. The values for the index of the activity concentration (I), radium equivalent activity (Ra-eq), and external hazard index (H-ext) showed that these construction materials could be used without restrictions or concern about the equivalent dose limit (1 mSv/year).

However, these research concepts have never been fused with each other. In this study, we introduced the antifungal calcite-forming bacteria (CFB) Bacillus aryabhattai KNUC205, isolated from an urban tunnel (Daegu, South Korea). The major fungal deteriogens in urban tunnel, Cladosporium sphaerospermum KNUC253, was used as a sensitive fungal strain. B. aryabhattai KNUC205 showed CaCO3 precipitation on B4 medium. Cracked cement mortar pastes were made and neutralized by modified methods. Subsequently, the mixture of B. aryabhattai KNUC205, conidiospore of C. sphaerospermum KNUC253, and B4 agar was applied to cement cracks and incubated at 18 degrees C for 16 days. B. aryabhattai KNUC205 showed fungal growth inhibition against C. sphaerospermum. Furthermore, B. aryabhattai KNUC205 showed crack remediation ability and water permeability reduction of cement mortar pastes. Taken together, these results suggest that the CaCO3 precipitation and antifungal properties of B. aryabhattai KNUC205 could be used as an effective sealing or coating material that can also prevent deteriorative fungal growth. This study is the first application and evaluation research that incorporates calcite formation with antifungal capabilities of microorganisms for an environment-friendly and more effective protection of cement materials. In this research, the conception of microbial construction materials was expanded.",2012
Effect of powder materials on the rheology and formwork pressure of self-consolidating concrete,SCC; Formwork pressure; Limestone filler; Fly ash,PACKING DENSITY; CEMENT PASTE; COMPACTING CONCRETE; LIMESTONE POWDER; YIELD-STRESS; FLOW; MODEL; SUSPENSIONS; VISCOSITY; MIXTURES,"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is a recently developed, innovative construction material. With use of SCC no additional compacting is necessary due to its high filling ability; as a result, the labor cost of compacting is economical. However, SCC may require stronger formwork that can resist the higher lateral pressure induced as compared to that for ordinary concrete. This study shows the effects of limestone filler or fly ash replacement on the formwork pressure and workability retention of a SCC mixture. Portland cement has been replaced with each of the powders in order to enhance its flowability and stability. It is observed that the powder replacement also increases the formwork pressure and decreases the workability retention. The effect of powder replacement on the formwork pressure is evaluated with a proposed two-function model, and discussed in comparison with the rheology of paste. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Characterization of aeolian sands from Indian desert,Aeolian sand; The Great Indian Thar desert; Characterization; Construction material; Industrial applications,THAR DESERT; DUNE SAND; STABILIZATION; SOIL; CHINA; ASH,"Aeolian sands, from Sam, Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, India, belong to the Great Indian Thar desert and, primarily, attract tourists from India and all over the world. Though, certain studies were conducted on the geological origin of these sand and deserts, results related to their physical, chemical, morphological, mineralogical, thermal, electrical and geotechnical characteristics are scanty. However, with an increase in demand of the land for infrastructure development (for residential, commercial and strategic facilities), for which their stabilization may be essential, and a need to utilize these (aeolian) sands as a construction material, particularly due to acute scarcity of sand, their complete characterization becomes essential. With this in view, a detailed study was conducted to characterize these sands and details are presented in this paper. In general, these sands are found to exhibit properties similar to aeolian sands from the Arabian Peninsula, Australia and China. Further, with an intention to utilize these sands in construction industry, especially as fine aggregate in concrete and mortar and designing thermal beds for buried conduits and electrical cables, the results have been compared with those for the Indian standard sands. Based on the chemical composition and chemical properties, and crushing strength of aeolian sands, their utilization in concrete and other construction materials (viz., bricks, building blocks, paver blocks etc.) appears to be quite promising. Also, the collapse potential of these sands has been found to be quite low while its angle of internal friction is quite high. These parameters suggest that aeolian sands from the Great Indian Thar desert can also be used for various engineering applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2012
Strength properties of high volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete at high temperatures,Compressive strength; Concrete; fly ash; Modulus of elasticity; Splitting tensile strength,ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; DURABILITY,"Fly ash has established itself as a potential construction material. It is used as partial replacement for cement and aggregate in cement-based materials. It is now being increasingly used in the design of normal-strength, high-strength and high-performance concretes. Because of this, it has become very important to study the behaviour of concrete containing large volumes of fly ash at elevated temperatures. There has been little research published in this area. Therefore, in this work, high-volume fly ash (HVFA) concrete mixtures were made by replacing 30, 40, and 50% cement with Class F fly ash. Concrete specimens were made and were cured for 28 and 56 days. Then, cylindrical specimens were subjected to elevated temperatures of 80, 100, and 120 degrees C. Tests were performed for measuring the residual compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, and the modulus of elasticity of HVFA concretes. Test results indicated that in comparison with the control mixture, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of concrete mixtures decreased with an increase in temperature.",2012
EFFECT OF GROUND GRANULATED BLAST FURNACE SLAG ON MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF PVA-ECC,cementitious composites; slag; ductility; toughness,ENGINEERED CEMENTITIOUS COMPOSITES; VOLUME; DESIGN,"As the most popular construction material, concrete has many advantages compared to other materials. However, its brittle nature causes cracking and results in many deterioration problems and failures in infrastructures. Considering the issue of sustainability, researchers around the world have conducted numerous studies to develop concrete that has better performances, higher durability, longer life span, and less damaging effects to nature. To obtain such characteristics, researchers not only focus on strength enhancement, but also ductility and toughness. This paper examines the effect of using ground granulated blast furnace slag as partial cement replacement in producing engineered cementitious composite (ECC), a ductile cementitious composite reinforced with short random fibers. Slag replacement is not only to increase the strength but also to create better fiber bridging property that results in better ductility of the material. Amount of slag replacement and slag fineness are the variables involved in the mixture proportions. The mechanical behaviors of ECC under uniaxial tensile tests and flexural tests as parameters to measure its ductility are reported.",2012
Estimation of CO2 emission of apartment buildings due to major construction materials in the Republic of Korea,CO2 emission; Embodied energy; Apartment building; Construction material,LIFE-CYCLE ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT; ENERGY,"Buildings emit much greenhouse gases as large amounts of resources and energy are consumed during their life cycle. CO2 emissions from residential buildings in the Republic of Korea (""Korea"" hereinafter) are expected to consistently increase. According to the statistical data, apartment buildings occupy a high portion (86.4%) of residential buildings, and it is expected to maintain a certain level every year due to residential building construction policy of the Korean government. So, apartment buildings are a very important subject of study. This study aims to quantify CO2 emissions emitted by six different size apartment units due to major construction materials consumed in construction. The result shows that CO2 emission of the various construction materials of an apartment unit was estimated to be 569.5 kg-CO2/m(2) on average. The apartment with the area of 84.9 m(2) for a common apartment type in Korea has about 11.8 TOE embodied energy and 45.1 ton-CO2 emission. The CO2 emissions from steel and concrete were 424.2-584.2 kg-CO2/m(2) for apartment units, occupying more than 82% of the total CO2 emissions. The results are valuable for the sustainable design of apartment complexes and are used as technical measures for the CO2 reduction strategy of the building sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Life cycle CO2 assessment of concrete by compressive strength on construction site in Korea,Concrete; Carbon dioxide (CO2); Life cycle assessment; Compressive strength,BUILDINGS; LCA,"As research on the reduction in the life cycle carbon dioxide (LCCO2) emissions of buildings has become increasingly important, the development of technologies that can quantitatively assess the LCCO2 emissions of a building at the level of the construction materials is essential. In addition, concrete of various compositions, such as high-performance concrete mixed with fly ash and blast furnace slag and eco-concrete, has become readily available and thus, a quantitative evaluation of CO2 basic units for these new materials is needed. However, basic units for various types of concrete are not provided by the National Life Cycle Inventory Database (LCI DB) in Korea. Therefore, thorough research on these materials has become an important priority. In this study, a method to assess LCCO2 emissions using the compressive strength of concrete is proposed. Specifically, the compressive strengths of various mixes of concrete that are employed at construction sites in Korea were utilized to evaluate CO2 emissions. Comparisons according to the characteristics of each mixture were also made. Approximately 560 concrete mix designs used at construction sites were first classified according to the compressive strength, admixture, and season. The concrete CO2 emissions assessment process was carried out for the concrete raw materials production stage, the concrete raw materials transportation stage, and the concrete production stage; quantitative assessment methods are proposed for the CO2 emissions at each stage. Based on the proposed assessment methods, an evaluation of the concrete CO2 emissions was conducted and the obtained values were analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012

This study focuses on the stress-strain behaviour under compression and especially the strain-softening of self-compacting concretes produced with limestone fillers. Four self-compacting concretes (SCC) and three conventional vibrated concretes (VC) were used to produce cylindrical test specimens with an h/d ratio of 3. The s-? diagram at five different ages (391 days) was recorded during uniaxial compressive tests. The peak strain of the SCC cylinders was shown to be higher than the ones recorded for VC concretes. However, the specific toughness of both concrete types turned out to be comparable.",2012
Life cycle assessment of granite application in sidewalks,City; Granite; Concrete; LCA; Pavement; Sidewalks; Slabs; Sustainability,URBAN; ENERGY,"Sidewalks are important built areas for promoting environmental sustainability in cities since they support walking as a zero emission form of transportation contributing to protect the environment and the health of individuals. However, sidewalk management is typically focused on assessing their suitability for users without applying any environmental criteria on the infrastructure design. The paper aims to quantify the environmental impact that sidewalks can contribute to the urban space if no environmental criteria are applied in sidewalk design. This study focuses on the environmental assessment of a very common sidewalk system found in cities to support pedestrian and light motorized traffic for over 45 years. The constructive solution consists of granite slabs (top layer) fixed on a mortar layer (3-cm thick) that is settled on a base of concrete (15-cm thick). The life cycle methodology was employed to conduct the environmental assessment of the system. The results are compared with the environmental outcomes of a sidewalk system that has the same function but is paved with concrete slabs to identify the environmentally optimal sidewalk design. The impact assessment method was CML Baseline 2001, and the inventory data were compiled from manufacturers associations, local authorities, and literature review. Construction materials have the highest environmental impact (48-87%) in the sidewalk life cycle, where the granite top layer is the first contributor, although the amount of granite in the sidewalk system represents the 30% of the total weight of the construction materials used. A granite sidewalk has from 25% to 140% higher impact than a concrete one. The energy required to produce slabs is the key factor that characterizes the environmental impact of granite. Electricity and diesel consumption in stone cutting and moving represent over the 70% of the environmental burden of granite. The transportation of granite slabs is also relevant to the environmental impact. The use of imported granite could account for up to 76-177% of the total environmental impact of the sidewalk life cycle. Although granite is a natural material, using granite slabs as flooring material is not an environmentally suitable alternative over using concrete ones for paving sidewalks. The results have shown that if no environmental criteria are applied during sidewalk design and management, urban planners may be unconsciously contributing to an important environmental burden on the built environment. The ecodesign is a strategic opportunity to promote environmentally suitable urban infrastructures that contribute to promote urban sustainability in cities. Energy efficiency techniques, water management and well-considered transportation management should be developed and implemented in the granite industry to minimize the environmental impact of using it for paving. Additionally, further research is needed to quantify the environmental performance of other construction materials used in sidewalk construction in order to identify the best environmental alternatives and design improvements by optimizing the use of materials to the sidewalks functions.",2012
Static and dynamic mechanical properties of concrete after high temperature exposure,Concrete; After high temperature exposure; Mechanical property; SHPB; Strain rate effect; Toughness,STRAIN,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the static and dynamic mechanical properties of concrete before and after high temperature exposure. Quasi-static and impact loading experiments were carried out on concrete before and after exposure to the temperature of 200-800 degrees C by using a servo-hydraulic testing machine and a 100-mm-diameter split Hopkinson bar (SHPB) apparatus, respectively. The results show that, mechanical properties of concrete after high temperature exposure change evidently, and the critical temperature for those changes acquiring dramatic character is 400 degrees C. With the rise of temperature up to 400 degrees C, compressive strength and critical strain change little compared with that of at room temperature. While with temperature increasing from 400 to 800 degrees C, the decrease in strength and the increase in critical strain become obvious. Consequentially, specific energy absorption (SEA), which is the synthetic exhibition of strength and ductility, decreases much less than those observed for strength over 400 degrees C. Dynamic compressive mechanical properties of concrete before and after high temperature exposure increase with the rise in strain rate rapidly, which exhibits strong strain rate dependency. Dynamic increase factor (DIF) increases approximately linearly with strain rate. In a word, concrete can be recognized as an excellent thermal-resistant and anti-impact construction material.

Stress rate sensitivity of stone masonry units bound with fibre reinforced hydraulic lime mortar,Drop-weight impact; Bond behaviour; Hydraulic lime mortar; Sandstone masonry; Polypropylene fibre; Stress rate sensitivity,CEMENTITIOUS COMPOSITES; STRENGTH; BOND; CONCRETE,"It is well established that most construction materials behave differently under static and dynamic loading. However, the literature on the time-dependent response of masonry joints is scarce, particularly with regard to the bond behaviour in historical stone masonry. This paper describes the dynamic response of sandstone masonry units bound with hydraulic lime mortars (HLMs). A drop weight impact machine was used to generate stress rates up to 10 7 kPa/s. The dynamic impact factor and stress rate sensitivity were evaluated for the flexural strength of the sandstone, mortar and for the bond strength of the unit and further, the pattern of failure was noted in the units for each mortar mix and loading rate. Based on a related study on the fracture toughness of HLM, polypropylene micro-fibres were incorporated at 0, 0.25 and 0.5% volume fraction into the mortar. Results show that the flexural bond strength was more sensitive to stress rate than the flexural strength of the mortar, at similar rates of loading. Further, the stress rate sensitivity of the bond strength decreased with an increase in the fibre content. Also, whereas the mode of failure in the masonry units under quasi-static loading was through fracture at the mortar-block interface, the failure plane transferred to within the mortar under dynamic loading, particularly in the presence of fibre reinforcement.",2012

These nano-particles are potentially dangerous if released into the environment. Preliminary studies are carried out on sludge-blended cement concrete (SBCC) formed into specimens of cylindrical concrete with 10 cm diameter and 20 cm height. They are with 10 wt.% cement replaced by CMP sludge powder. Three water/cementitious (W/C) ratios were selected to mold the specimens for setting time, XRD analysis, TCLP analysis and compressive strength and stress-strain tests, respectively. TCLP test results revealed that the concentrations of leached heavy metals were substantially below the regulatory thresholds. The strengths of the SBCC specimens were comparable to those of the ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPCC) specimens with 3-day curing and about 22-38% much higher than those of OPCC cylindrical concrete specimens at 7-91 days of age. These results demonstrate the feasibility of recycling CMP sludge into construction materials, a positive step for sustainable development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012

One approach, formulated here, makes use of eco-friendly fireproof high-strength polymer cementitious composites made from blast furnace slag (an industrial by-product). And we were used the activator which is necessary to function as a catalyst to induce the hydration of blast furnace slag. In addition, we were used the polypropylene fibre, and porcelain to improve the fire-resistance. To evaluate the properties of eco-friendly fireproof high-strength polymer cementitious composites, we tested mechanical properties in laboratory experiments such as compressive strength and fire-resistance.

Cement kiln dust (CKD) is one of such industrial waste or by product which is progressively significant environmental concern related to its emission and disposal. CKD is fine grained, solid, highly alkaline particulate material chiefly composed of oxidized, anhydrous, micron-sized particles collected from electrostatic precipitators during the production of cement clinker. Cement kiln dust so generated is partly reused in cement plants and landfilled. Due to lack of landfilling space and ever increasing disposal cost, utilization of CKD in highway uses, waste treatment, soil stabilization, cement mortar/concrete, CLSM, etc. has become an attractive alternative to its disposal. The leachate obtained from cement kiln dust may contain hazardous compounds and its caustic nature poses harmful effects to the environment. So, it is essential to know the characteristics of leachate obtained from CKD for beneficial utilization towards solid waste management. Several studies have shown that CKD could be used in making cement paste/mortar/concrete. This paper presents the overview of some of the research published on the beneficial use of CKD in construction materials, reducing carbon dioxide emissions and CKD leachate characteristics. Effect of CKD on the cement paste/mortar/concrete properties like compressive strength, tensile strength, durability, hydration, electrical conductivity, etc. and leachate test methods and leachate characteristics of cement kiln dust is also discussed in this paper.

Influence of binder content, water/binder ratio, ground granulated blastfurnace slag (GGBS) content, and limestone powder (LP) replacement on fluidity and compressive strength of concrete were researched, respectively. The test results show that the addition of superplasticizer and fine mineral additives enabled the UHPC to be produced at an extremely low water/binder ratio of 0.14-0.18, achieving excellent workability with a maximum slump of 268 mm and compressive strengths of 175.8 MPa at 90 d and 182.9 MPa at 365 d.

Properties of concrete containing fungal treated waste foundry sand,Aspergillus; Compressive strength; Microbial concrete; Porosity; Waste foundry sand; Water absorption; X-ray diffraction,STRENGTH,"Waste foundry sands represent the highest amount of solid wastes generated by foundries. The high cost of land-filling and the potential uses of waste foundry sand in construction purposes have prompted research into their beneficial reuse. For high-performance construction materials microbial (bacteria/fungi) modified concrete has become an important area of research. This study investigates the effects of incorporating fungal treated waste foundry sand (WFS) on concrete. Results present the effect of Aspergillus spp. on compressive strength, water absorption and porosity of concrete containing waste foundry sand. The study shows that 15.6% increase in compressive strength of concrete after 28 days was achieved with the addition of fungal (Aspergillus spp.) treated 20% WFS containing concrete and also shows decrease in water absorption (68.8%) and porosity (45.9%). X-ray diffraction (XRD) results suggest that fungal culture (Aspergillus spp.) is capable to form good C-S-H gel than untreated concrete containing WFS, which shows that Aspergillus spp. increase the ability of cement to react properly with foundry sand and hence due to which C-S-H gel formation increases. Silica present in WFS is consumed to form C-S-H gel, which in turn hardened the fungal treated waste foundry sand containing concrete. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012

However, almost all standards and design codes governing the use of cementitious binders and concrete in construction are based on the use of Portland cement. The 100+ year track record of in-service application of Portland cement is inherently assumed to validate the protocols used for accelerated durability testing. Moreover, the entire supply chain associated with cementitious materials is based on the production of Portland cement. The geopolymerisation of aluminosilicates constitutes a radical change in construction materials chemistry and synthesis pathways compared with the calcium silicate hydrate chemistry which underpins Portland cement. Consequently, there are regulatory, supply chain, product confidence and technical barriers which must be overcome before geopolymer cement could be widely adopted. High profile demonstration projects in Australia have highlighted the complex regulatory, asset management, liability and industry stakeholder engagement process required to commercialise geopolymer cement. While the scale-up from the laboratory to the real-world is technically challenging, the core challenge is the scale-up of industry participation and acceptance of geopolymer cement. Demand pull by a carbon conscious market continues to be the key driver for the short term adoption of geopolymer cement. In the absence of an in-service track record comparable in scale and longevity to Portland cement, research is essential to validate durability testing methodology and improve geopolymer cement technology. Colloid and interface science, gel chemistry, phase formation, reaction kinetics, transport phenomena, comminution, particle packing and rheology, which are familiar concepts to minerals engineers, are also key building blocks in the development of geopolymer knowledge.

The effectiveness of MICP in reducing reinforcement corrosion is investigated. Reinforced concrete (RC) specimens were treated with the bacterial strain Bacillus sp. CT-5, isolated from the cement sample, and subjected to accelerated corrosion. The results showed that bacterial-treated RC specimens reduced the corrosion rate four times more than the control specimens. A considerable reduction in mass loss and increase in pullout strength is observed with MICP-treated specimens. Corn steep liquor, an industrial pollutant; was used as a nutrient source to grow the bacterial cells for MICP in cementitious structures. This is a step toward the development of microbial concrete that provides a greener and more ecofriendly option.",2012
Transesterification of soybean oil to biodiesel using cement as a solid base catalyst,Biodiesel; Solid catalyst; Cement; Transesterification; Triglyceride,CALCIUM-OXIDE; CONCRETE; METHANOL; ALKALI,"This work studies the recycling of cement as a catalyst in the production of biodiesel by transesterification of soybean oil with methanol. Literature survey showed that cement has never been studied as a solid catalyst in the transesterification of triglyceride. Concrete is a composite construction material composed of cement, aggregate, water, and chemical admixtures. In these composite, Portland cement was supposed to be an efficacious catalyst for biodiesel production. Therefore, the catalytic effects of calcination temperature, oil/alcohol ratio (mol/mol), and catalyst amount (wt% of oil) of hydrated cement were discussed. Finally, the waste concrete catalyst was successfully used in the transesterification reaction of soybean oil according to catalytic property of the cement catalyst.

Determining the in situ concrete strength of existing structures for assessing their structural safety,concrete strength; structural safety; codes; Baustoffe - building materials; construction materials; Bauwerkserhaltung; Sanierung - building maintenance; refurbishment,,"EN 13791 applies when assessing the in situ compressive strength of structures and precast concrete components. According to the code itself, it may be adopted when doubt arises about the compressive strength of a concrete. For assessing the structural safety of existing structures, however, the method given in EN 13791 does not seem to be applicable and may lead to an unsafe approach for determining the characteristic concrete strength. This paper presents an alternative method for determining the characteristic concrete strength from cylinders obtained in situ. The method proposed is based on EN 1990 (Eurocode basis of design) and the corresponding Annex D. The method according to EN 13791 is outlined in this article. Moreover, the practical implementation of the method in accordance with clause 5.2 of EN 1990 is explained and an example is given. Finally, both methods are compared with each other. It is demonstrated that EN 13791 does not apply to safety assessments of existing concrete structures and the use of this code may lead to unsafe situations.",2012
Ultimate strength of curved strand tendons,heavy lifting; balanced lift method; strand tendons; post-tensioning; radius of curvature; full scale tests; Baustoffe - building materials; construction materials; Dynamische Einwirkungen; Erdbeben - dynamic actions; earthquakes,,"In a bridge construction process, where large concrete elements are rotated with the aid of strand lifting units (lowering of arch halves, balanced lift method), the tendons have to be deviated over saddles with small radii of curvature. Since information on the ultimate strength of curved strand tendons was not available at the time, a test programme was carried out in order to determine the ultimate strength as a function of radius of curvature (R = 0.5 m, R = 1.0 m, R = 3.0 m, straight tendons), number of strands (1 to 55) and type of strand (0.5? and 0.6?). The results of the full scale experiments showed almost no decrease in efficiency with regard to single strand tendons and only moderate losses regarding multistrand tendons. Based on the experimental results and a biaxial failure criterion, an analytical model was developed which is able to predict the ultimate strength of curved tendons.",2012
Formwork pressure induced by highly flowable concretes - design approach and transfer into practice,formwork pressure; friction; fresh concrete properties; setting; Baustoffe - building materials; construction materials; Berechnungs- und Bemessungsverfahren - analysis and design methods,SELF-CONSOLIDATING CONCRETE,"An analytical model for the calculation of the pressure of concrete on vertical formwork has been developed on the basis of experimental tests on highly flowable concretes in the fresh state (see companion paper Material investigations and large-scale tests). The model takes into account the time-dependent material parameters of the fresh concrete, the specific properties of the highly flowable vibrated concretes and self-compacting concretes (SCC) as well as operational aspects. A proposal for the design of formwork was developed based on the experimental tests and the semi-probabilistic safety concept. It was found that the design load is often lower than the hydrostatic concrete pressure even for highly flowable concretes. On construction sites, the pressure can be best controlled by limiting the casting rate. Insufficient experience of personnel in the handling of highly flowable concretes increases the uncertainties with respect to the design values and the safety risk. Further investigations into construction management-related aspects regarding the use of highly flowable concretes cover the risk assessment during concreting, design of the processes on the construction site and the development of the basis for a documentation system.",2012
Modeling of mechanical properties and bond relationship using data mining process,Reinforced concrete; Data mining; Bond strengths; Flexural strengths; Bond slippage; Modeling and prediction,ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; CONCRETE,"Reinforced concrete is a widely used construction material. Its properties depend on the bond between the reinforcing bar and concrete as much as the compressive strength or properties of the reinforcing bar because of component of construction expose to both flexural and bond together compressive loads. In this paper, the bond properties of concretes with different mix designs were investigated according to the results of compressive, flexural, bond, and flexural-bond tests. The data mining (DM) process was used to determine relationships among the test results and DM algorithms. Seventeen modeling techniques within WEKA were applied to the experimental data for the prediction of bond properties. The results show that the implemented models were good at predicting the bond properties. The best results were obtained from the Rep Tree algorithm for bond strength, the Multi layer Perceptron algorithm for flexural-bond strength, the MedSq algorithm for bond slippage, and the Pace Regression for flexural-bond deformation. Bond and flexural-bond can be easily predicted using the compressive strength, flexural strength and tensile stress of the rebar. Although a relationship is also existent between these and bond slippage and flexural-bond deformation, these relationships are weaker than the others. These results suggested that the DM algorithms can be used as an alternative approach to predict the bond strength using the results of compressive, flexural, bond, and flexural-bond tests as input parameters. The predictions of the bond slippage and flexural-bond deformation models poorly agreed with the experimental results. It can be obtained more successful results for these variables, when DM models with different inputs like the rebar-concrete interface stress together the measured parameters are used.

Development and Applications of the Intrinsic Model for Formwork Pressure of Self-Consolidating Concrete,Formwork; SCC; prediction model; peak pressure; friction; mineral admixture,,"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is a recently developed innovative construction material. SCC fills in a formwork without any vibrating consolidation, which allows us to eventually achieve robust casting. However, high formwork lateral pressure exerted by SCC is a critical issue regarding its application as cast-in-place concrete. In order to control the risk caused by high formwork pressure, a comprehensive prediction model for the pressure was previously proposed, investigated, and validated with various SCC mixtures. The model was originally designed to simulate the intrinsic pressure response of SCC mixtures while excluding other extrinsic influencing factors such as friction and flexibility of the formwork. The model was then extended to consider extrinsic factors such as friction between SCC mixtures and formwork. In addition, other interesting topics for peak formwork pressure and mineral admixture effects were summarized in the paper.",2012

A most important invention in concrete technology, i.e., the use of curing materials during concrete production, has favorable effects on concrete strength and provides better curing conditions for concrete. In this study, some chemical curing materials recently used in concrete production, to provide and facilitate the curing conditions of concrete, were investigated experimentally, in terms of their effects on the compressive strength values of the concrete specimens produced with more than one chemical admixture.

"The influences of admixtures on the dispersion, workability, and strength of carbon nanotube-OPC paste mixtures",Carbon nanotube; Cement; Dispersion; Workability; Strength,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; CEMENT COMPOSITES; MICROSTRUCTURE; NANOCOMPOSITES; SURFACTANTS; DECORATION; BEHAVIOR,"Carbon nanotubes (CNT) have excellent mechanical properties and have the potential, if combined with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), traditionally a brittle material in tension, to become a nano-composite with superlative mechanical properties. However, highly attractive van der Waals forces between CNTs create coherent agglomerates that prove difficult to disperse within the cement matrix and reduce the fluidity of the fresh mixture. Good dispersion of CNTs, while maintaining good workability of fresh OPC-CNT paste mixtures, is a prequalification before CNT-cement nanocomposites can be considered as a future building and construction material with enhanced mechanical properties. This paper reports the results of investigations of the dispersion, workability, and strength of CNT aqueous and CNT-OPC paste mixtures, with and without several generically different dispersants/surfactants that are compatible as admixtures in the manufacture of concrete. These include an air entrainer, styrene butadiene rubber, polycarboxylates, calcium naphthalene sulfonate, and lignosulfonate formulations. Aqueous mixtures were initially assessed for dispersion of CNTs, followed by workability testing of selected OPC-CNT-dispersant/surfactant paste mixtures. A broad range of workability responses were measured and the CNT dispersion within hardened pastes was qualitatively assessed by SEM analysis. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Life cycle energy consumption and CO2 emission of an office building in China,China; Office building; CO2 emission; Energy consumption; Life cycle assessment,ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE; EMBODIED ENERGY; WOOD; CONCRETE; DESIGN; LCA; CONSTRUCTION; INDUSTRY; SYSTEMS; CHALLENGES,"Building is one of the main factors of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from building is urgent for environmental protection and sustainable development. The objective of this study is to develop a life cycle assessment (LCA) model for an office building in China to assess its energy consumption and CO2 emission, determine the whole life cycle phases, and the significant environmental aspects that contribute most to the impact. A process-based LCA has been used to identify and quantify the energy consumption and CO2 emission of the office building. The LCA is conducted in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency, The Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, and the International Organization for Standardization standards for life cycle assessments. The entire life cycle including building materials production, construction, operation, and demolition of the building is studied. A service life of 50 years is assumed and the major construction materials such as concrete, cement, brick, steel, timber, glass, and plastic are selected for the building. The results show that building operation uses the largest share of energy and contributes most to CO2 emission. The cooling and heating system in building operation strongly influence the energy consumption and CO2 emission of the building. In addition, the large quantity use of concrete and steel in materials production, and the treatment of end-of-life building materials are also the important aspects impacting the environmental performance of the building. Based on the results of the study, some environmental improvements aiming at reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission throughout the life cycle of the building are provided. This study provides an LCA of the energy consumption and CO2 emission of a typical office building in China. It determines the whole life cycle phases that contribute most to the impact and defines the significant environmental aspects of the building. This study also shows the importance of using a life cycle perspective when evaluating energy consumption and CO2 emission of building and also lays the groundwork for LCA studying of other office buildings in China.",2012
Time-dependent effects on dynamic properties of cable-stayed bridges,cable-stayed bridges; concrete creep; geometric nonlinearities; structural health monitoring systems; time-dependent behaviour,CONCRETE; CREEP; SHRINKAGE,"Structural health monitoring systems are often installed on bridges to provide assessments of the need for structural maintenance and repair. Damage or deterioration may be detected by observation of changes in bridge characteristics evaluated from measured structural responses. However, construction materials such as concrete and steel cables exhibit certain time-dependent behaviour, which also results in changes in structural characteristics. If these are not accounted for properly, false alarms may arise. This paper proposes a systematic and efficient method to study the time-dependent effects on the dynamic properties of cable-stayed bridges. After establishing the finite element model of a cable-stayed bridge taking into account geometric nonlinearities and time-dependent behaviour, long-term time-dependent analysis is carried out by time integration. Then the dynamic properties of the bridge after a certain period can be obtained. The effects of time-dependent behaviour of construction materials on the dynamic properties of typical cable-stayed bridges are investigated in detail.",2012
Relation of Resonant Frequency and Appropriate Linear Predictive Order for Evaluating Concrete Strength by Quality Factor,,,"Concrete is a popular construction material used broadly in many kinds of structures. The compressive strength is the most important performance of the concrete responsible to the safety of such structures. Although method of sampling a specimen is commonly employed, it makes damage to the structures. While Schmidt Hammer measures the hardness of the surface, but it relates to the compressive strength with poor accuracy owing to the influence of the conditions of the surface. Considering that the ultrasound propagating inside the concrete with higher strength will decrease less, the quality factor of the ultrasound signals should be higher, we have proposed a new method that evaluates the concrete strength non-destructively using the quality factor of resonant peak of multi-reflected ultrasound propagated inside the concrete. The quality factor is calculated by a linear predictive coefficient (LPC) processing on the ultrasonic signals, where the order of the LPC is an important parameter, by which the number of the poles of the LPC model is determined. Neither too many poles, which include too much details of the original signal with noise, nor too few poles, which lack of the proprieties at the resonant peaks, may express the propriety of ultrasonic propagation clearly. In this paper, as one of the approach of optimizing the parameters employed in measurement and signal processing, the relation between the resonant frequency and the appropriate order of LPC is discussed by numerical simulation and experiment. In the experiment, three types of concrete specimen with identical dimensions but different strengths (48.4 N/mm(2), 37.1 N/mm(2) and 27.9 N/mm(2) respectively) and four kinds of sound sources and receivers with different resonant frequency (28 kHz, 46 kHz, 68 kHz and 105 kHz, respectively) are employed. In the numerical simulation, a low-pass IIR filter is introduced to simulate the absorption of ultrasonic propagation in the concrete. Though the absorption is very complicated and hard to be reconstructed by numerical simulation, the absorption differences corresponding to different strengths are simulated by changing the coefficients of the IIR filter as a simplified model to study the relation between resonant frequencies and appropriate orders of LPC for strength evaluation. The results of both the experiment and the numerical simulation show a similar tendency that with a higher resonant frequency, the appropriate order of LPC turns higher and its range turns narrower. Therefore, in the view of stability of the quality factor employed to evaluate the concrete strength, measurement with lower resonant frequency is expected.",2012
Characterizations mechanical and microstructural of flax fibre cement composite reinforced,,,"With the purpose of the flax fibre valuing in construction materials, this study focuses on the characterizations mechanical and microstructural of flax fibre cement composite reinforced. The mechanical strength was studied as the function of fibre volume ratio and length. Meanwhile, the microstructural analysis investigated the homogeneity of fibre scattering, the interaction fibre/cement matrix and the influence of flax fibres on the defects microstructures. The results show the interesting mechanical properties of flax fibre in comparison with other fibre vegetable. But they are damaged in an alkaline environment such as concrete or cement composite. In fresh state, a good adherence between fibre and cement matrix was found. But as hydrophilic, the flax fibres absorb water and become inflated. Afterwards, the fibres return deflated at the drying time and this dry/wet cycling reduce the fibre/matrix bond. Being reinforced by the flax fibres, the brute failure of cement materials was replaced by the one more ductile when the fibre ratio increased. This transition was evaluated by the toughness indexes that allow measuring the energy absorption of flax fibre.",2012

Conjugate conduction convection and radiation heat transfer through hollow autoclaved aerated concrete blocks,natural convection; laminar flow; conjugate; inter-surface radiation; square enclosure; control-volume method; building energy simulation,FINITE-VOLUME METHOD; NATURAL-CONVECTION; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; CLAY BRICKS; OPTIMIZATION; CONFIGURATION; SURFACES; CAVITY; WALLS; FLOW,"A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model is developed to study thermal performance of hollow autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) blocks in wall constructions of buildings under hot summer conditions. The goal is to determine size and distribution of cavities (within building blocks) that reduce heat flow through the walls and thereby lead to energy savings in air conditioning. The model couples conjugate, laminar natural convective flow of a viscous fluid (air) in the cavities with long-wave radiation between the cavity sides. Realistic boundary conditions were employed at the outdoor and indoor surfaces of the block. A state-of-the-art building energy simulation programme was used to determine the outdoor thermal environment that included solar radiation, equivalent temperature of the surroundings, and convective heat transfer coefficient. The CFD problem is put into dimensionless formulation and solved numerically by means of the control-volume approach. The study yielded comprehensive, detailed quantitative estimates of temperature, stream function and heat flux throughout the AAC block domain. The results show a complex dependence of heat flux through the blocks on cavity and block sizes. In general, introducing large cavities in AAC blocks, being a construction material of low thermal conductivity, leads to greater heat transfer than the corresponding solid blocks. Several small cavities in a block may lead to small reductions in heat flux, but the best configuration found is a large cavity with a fine divider mesh in which case heat flux reductions of 50% are achievable.",2012
DURABLE CONCRETE STRUCTURES WITH CRACKS WHICH HEAL THEMSELVES,Cementitious material; Crack; Durability; Autonomous repair; Capsule; Healing agent,,"Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials due to its excellent mechanical properties and relatively low cost. However, concrete is prone to crack formation. These cracks do not impair the structural integrity, but they endanger the durability of the structure as aggressive liquids and gasses may enter via these cracks and cause degradation. Therefore, crack repair is needed but these repair works increase the cost of concrete structures by 50 % as they are labour intensive and because the structure becomes in disuse during repair. Accordingly, in this research it was investigated whether cementitious materials can be modified so that cracks heal themselves. Therefore, healing agents were encapsulated by brittle capsules and embedded inside the cementitious matrix in the zones where cracks were expected. When the matrix starts cracking, the capsules break and release their content, leading to crack repair. Water absorption measurements were performed to evaluate the healing efficiency. The amount of absorbed water was determined by gravimetrical measurements and visualized by X-ray radiography. When samples with untreated cracks were placed with their cracked surface in a water reservoir, it was noticed from the radiographs that water penetrated very fast into the cracks. For samples with self-healing properties no water entered into the cracks. Moreover, even in the zone alongside the crack no water entry was noticed. Therefore, it can be concluded that self-healing of concrete cracks can be used to prevent the ingress of liquids and to prevent subsequent damage to the matrix.",2012

In recent years, researchers have established that the utilization of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) can be used as alternative binders to Portland cement, and it will improve the various properties of concrete in fresh and hardened states. In this work, the effect of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) on the strength and durability properties of concrete is studied. For the experimental investigation, four concrete mixes were prepared. The replacement rates were varied as 0 %, 30%, 40% and 50%. A concrete mix of grade M30 was investigated keeping water binder ratio as 0.465 with a total cementitious material content of 400 kg/m(3) of concrete.

However, research dedicated to curved FRP construction material applicable to tunnel or arch bridge is still absent. This study conducts loading tests and finite element analysis in order to examine the behavior of curved FRP-concrete panel produced by pultrusion. The test results reveal that FRP and concrete exhibit linear elastic behavior until the maximum load.

Calculating Temperature Distribution in Concrete Encased H-Section Steel Column in Fires Using TFIELD,Natural fire; H-section steel column; Temperature distribution; Numerical simulation,,"Steel concrete composite columns are used extensively in modem buildings in recent decades due to the benefits of combining two construction materials: reinforced concrete is inexpensive, massive, and stiff, while steel members are strong, lightweight, and easy to assemble. For concrete-encased composite structural members, an additional advantage is that the concrete used for encasing a structural steel not only increases its stiffness, but also protects it from fire damage and local buckling failure. Traditionally, the fire resistance of composite structural members has been determined in standard fire tests, with the temperature-time curves representing more severe heating conditions compared to that which occurs in many typical natural fire compartments. To design a concrete encased H-section steel structure safely and economically, it is necessary to calculate temperature distribution in composite steel-concrete columns under natural fire. In this paper, the program TFIELD written by first author is used to calculate the temperature distribution in a concrete encased H-section steel column under natural fire and ISO 834 fire.

The Use of Nanosilica for Improving of Concrete Compressive Strength and Durability,Nanotechnology; Nanosilica; Compressive Strength; durability,,"The development of construction materials technology, particularly concrete is growing very rapidly in the presence of nanotechnology.

Based on previous research, silica fume is proven effective to improve the mechanical properties and durability of concrete. A novel nanotechnological process allows producing amorphous nanosilica with high reactivity from locally available silica sand. In this study a locally available nanosilica is used on mortar and concrete thereby limiting the use of commercial nanosilica materials from semiconductor industry waste.

In this study, an advanced material of high strength and strong abrasion resistance HMPE fiber was used to reinforce concrete properties. A series of experimental testing were carried out to examine the properties of both fresh and hardened HMPE fiber reinforced concrete. It was found that the addition of an HMPE fiber material in concrete may enhance its compressive strength as high as 20% increment without water-reducing admixture.

Fingerprinting of Chemical Admixtures in Fresh Portland Cement Concrete by Portable Infrared Spectrometer,,SPECTRA,"The ongoing second SHRP 2 R06-B project entitled Evaluating Applications of Field Spectroscopy Devices to Fingerprint Commonly Used Construction Materials conducted at the University of Connecticut targets, among other objectives, the identification and quantification of chemical admixtures in portland cement concrete (PCC). The two specific objectives for the PCC study are (a) the applicability of portable infrared spectrometers for identification of the admixtures in fresh concrete under field conditions and (b) the feasibility of tracking interaction between hydration products during PCC setting. In the first phase of the study, four admixtures (air entrainer, retarder, accelerator, and superplasticizer) were tested to establish their chemical signature in the infrared and ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The fingerprinting of the admixtures was performed with a portable attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The second phase concerned evaluating freshly mixed PCC samples prepared with each admixture separately in the amount prescribed by the manufacturer. Chemical changes in the PCC samples were tracked over the 6-h period by the portable ATR spectrometer. Quantitative analysis of the ATR spectra allowed for evaluating the effect of chemical admixtures on hydration activity in PCC.",2012
Freeze-Thaw Durability and Salt Scaling Resistance Assessment of Portland Cement Concrete Composite Pavement,,,"The SHRP 2 R21 project on composite pavement investigated the durability of various mixtures of portland cement concrete (PCC) used in the construction of a two-layer composite PCC pavement. Project consultants in Europe, where composite PCC over PCC pavement was more common than in the United States, advised the R21 research team to consider using the CIF (capillary suction, internal damage, and freeze-thaw) standard of the International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction Materials, Systems, and Structures (RILEM), Paris, rather than the familiar ASTM standards. As a result, the R21 project adopted the RILEM CIF standard to evaluate the freeze-thaw durability and salt scaling resistance of concretes. The research also explored a modified RILEM CIF test (using pure water instead of a sodium chloride solution in scaling tests) alongside the standard RILEM CIF tests. The paper describes this experience to expose other institutions and agencies in the United States to the RILEM standards for the freeze-thaw durability and salt scaling resistance testing of concretes.",2012
CONTRIBUTIONS REGARDING THE EVALUATION OF THE ABILITY OF CONCRETE TO BIND CO2 BY CARBONATION,concrete; carbonation; CO2 uptake; drying; X-ray method,,"Concrete is the most frequently used man-mad construction material. Although it is considered non-ecological due to the great amount of CO2 emissions at cement production, concrete can reabsorb a part of the released CO2. This paper encompasses theoretical work and laboratory determinations regarding the ability of concrete to absorb atmospheric CO2 by carbonation. The presentation contains an original model for the calculation of carbonation depth, followed by a short overview of existing studies in the field of CO2 uptake.

The experimental results were in good correlation with the theoretical models and an appropriate coefficient has been obtained.",2012
WOOD AS A CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL: COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION TYPES FOR RESIDENTIAL BUILDING USING THE ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS,Wood construction; analytic hierarchy process; building criteria; residential building,MODEL; MANAGEMENT; JUDGMENTS; TIMBER,"Considering the growing importance of energy-efficient building methods, timber construction will play an increasingly important role in the future. In order to determine advantages and disadvantages of using wood as a leading constructional material, different construction types were compared: solid wood, wood-frame, concrete, brick, and steel construction. To quantify the comparisons the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used. AHP enables the inclusion of various parameters, including descriptive ones, in a mathematical model through which the importance of each construction criterion forming part of the system can be calculated in order to provide objective decisions for construction. Analysis revealed that the top ranked criteria in decision-making include quality of life, construction cost and depreciation costs. On comparing different construction types the wood-frame construction was considered as the most suitable option for residential building.",2012

EFFECT OF ORNAMENTAL ROCK SLUDGE ON THE STRENGTH AND DENSIFICATION OF CEMENT PAVEMENT BLOCKS,Pavement; cement block; densification; ornamental rock; sludge waste,COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; DESIGN; CONCRETE; MORTARS; WASTE,"The city of Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, in the southwest of Brazil, has a large industrial activity related to the extraction of ornamental stones. This brings jobs and income to the state of Espirito Santo but also cause problems due to the discard of the sludge resulting from the stone processing operations (SPO). The reuse of this SPO in construction materials such as plaster and bricks has been proposed as an alternative to reduce its environmental impact. This work evaluates another low cost alternative based on the incorporation of the SPO in the fabrication of cement pavement blocks. Using an experimental planning method, the mixture of sand, gravel and SPO, jointly with a water/cement proportion, was investigated for the method surface response. Based on this statistical method, pavement blocks with an apparent density of 1.96 g/cm(3) were found for incorporation in the range of 10 to 34%.",2012
Effect of Strain Rate on the Compressive Mechanical Properties of Concrete,Concrete; Compressive Strength; Elastic Modulus; Strain rate; Experimental Study,,"Concrete is one of the most widely used construction material throughout the world. But the properties of concrete under different strain rates differ from each other greatly. In order to investigate the effect of strain rate on concrete compressive mechanical properties, compressive experiments of concrete specimens (C35) are carried out on MTS, with the uniaxial strain rates ranging from 10(-5)/s to 10(-2)/s. The compressive mechanical properties of concrete under different stain rates, which include compressive strength, elastic modulus, peak strain and Poisson's ratio are studied systematically. The formulas which can describe the change laws of the compressive properties of concrete under different the strain rates are proposed. The test results show that the compresseive strength and elastic modulus of concrete would increase with the strain rate increasing. The effect of strain rate on peak strain and and Poisson's ratio is not significant. These research achievements can contribute to grasp the dynamic properties and build the dynamic constitutive models of concrete.",2012
Discussion on properties and microstructure of geopolymer concrete containing fly ash and recycled aggregate,Fly ash; recycled aggregate; geopolymer; compressive strength; microstructure,RESISTANCE; STRENGTH; CEMENT,"Construction materials dominate the main responsibility to maintain the environmental sustainable development in human's activities. Geopolymer concrete containing fly ash and recycled aggregate is a new concrete which can reuse the by-product of power station and waste concrete, as well as reduce the production of cement which contribute a lot of carbon dioxide emission in the manufacturing process.

Ultra Durable Concrete for Sustainable Construction,Concrete; Durability; Slag; Silica fume; chloride penetration; SCM,,"With the rapid consumption of natural resources, there is a growing concern about sustainable development. More than 6 billion tons of concrete are produced annually for various construction purposes with limited life expectancy. In addition, increasing cost of construction and demolition of concrete structures in densely populated areas is a great concern for the future. One of the best solutions to tackle these challenges is to increase the life expectancy of the structures. Residential structures and important civil structures are typically designed for a life span of 50 and 100 years respectively. However, the life expectancy of structures can be increased to several hundred years with careful planning and proper design. Cost of the concrete materials is not a considerable amount compared to the total cost for construction of reinforced concrete structures. Doubling the concrete materials cost may only increase the total construction cost by few percent but it can increase the life expectancy of structures significantly. In this work, a comparison between ultra durable concrete mixes with normal high strength concrete in terms of cost, mechanical and durability aspects is presented. Ultra durable concrete has superior qualities which makes it a favourable construction material for future structures.",2012

This project is an innovation aimed at adding value to the available resources of materials and personnel to expose untapped opportunities that are beneficial to the Rwandan community and the world in general through conservation of the environment and creation of employment. In a similar sense, this effort responds to the result of too much consumption of wood products in this rapidly growing infrastructure sector and calls for alternatives such as concrete in construction of door and window frames in order to answer the research objectives, the researchers opted to observe, carry out demonstrations/modeling, views of the end users of the product especially for water tanks. Data gathered from this research instrument were then computed and interpreted. Along with primary data, the researchers also made use of secondary resources in the form of published articles and literatures to support the survey results. Curved interlocking concrete blocks are affordable, environment friendly, labour intensive and use locally available materials, adoptable by both the rural and urban settings, uses local materials and uses local labour hence providing employment. At the end, these products were compared with conventional materials for their costs and maintenance. The results show promise as new construction material suitable for use in Rwanda.

Potentiality of Plaster Reinforced by Bamboo in Structural Elements,gypsum; bamboo; structural element,,"The world crosses an energetic, environmental and social crisis without precedents. Architecture and Engineering are also responsible because the more used industrialized construction materials, as Portland cement, concrete and steel, in their production process, demand a lot of energy, cause serious impacts to the environment and need big investments. One possibility to decrease this problem is the non compulsory employment of products based on Portland cement and steel, but also using local materials with which is possible to construct worthily. This work has as proposal the development of a structural gypsum element reinforced with bamboo that can be used as lintel and against-lintel in the constructions. Prisms samples (4cm x 4cm x 16cm) of gypsum matrix reinforced with bamboo rods were prepared and flexural tests were made. To improve bond between the two materials, treatments in the bamboo were tested. The tests showed that the most efficient material for this treatment was epoxy glue. Pre-fabricated structural peaces in real size were also tested through flexion tests in laboratory and applied in an prototype built in the University campus. The casting was made using vibratory table. Results show that vibrated bamboo reinforced gypsum is viable to be used in small structural beams and even replacing wood peaces in roofs.",2012

Based on the pseudo static test of five recycled reinforcement concrete frame columns with different experimental axial compression ratios from 0.3 to 0.65, their failure modes, failure mechanism, hysteretic behavior, skeleton curves, bearing capacity, rigidity, ductility and energy dissipation capacity were discussed. Some possible influence factors and disciplines were also selected and analyzed. The study indicates that recycled reinforcement concrete frame columns in the case of relative low axial compression ratios usually exhibited similar and steady mechanical properties with common concrete columns. With the increase of axial compression ratio, its ductility and energy dissipation capacity are decreased and destruction forms tended to obvious brittle fracture, though its bearing capacity could slightly rise.

Research of Thermal and Moisture Transport within Compound Bamboo Wall with Different Moisture Content,Bamboo plywood; moisture content; thermal conductivity; building enclosure energy conservation,,"In order to evaluate the energy-saving effect of the bamboo plywood as building enclosure, by measuring thermal conductivity of compound bamboo building enclosure with different moisture content, performance function between bamboo characteristic and thermal conductivity were deduced with numerical analysis method. First, we measured thermal conductivity with different moisture content. For the accuracy of data, we put a thin plastic film between the heating layer of the tester and the bamboo plywood to reduce water evaporation. Then we got the functional relation of moisture content and thermal conductivity, by using numerical analysis software. Finally, according to the national related standard and the performance of the bamboo plywood within different moisture content, we analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the bamboo plywood as building enclosure. The results showed that the heat preservation and thermal insulation properties of bamboo plywood as construction materials are both stronger than traditional building materials such as reinforced concrete with different moisture content. Meanwhile, so as to ensure the heat preservation and thermal insulation properties and to achieve a good energy saving effect, we'd better keep the moisture content of bamboo plywood in a low state.",2012

Existing cement processing methods need to be transformed in order to meet climate goals. The development of new materials, deliberately designed to reduce environmental impacts, can be accomplished through the replacement of dwindling raw materials with suitable waste products. This research explores agrowaste materials that have pozzolanic properties and can be used to replace a proportion of pure cement in a cement-based mixture. Agrowaste, such as those from palm oil and olive oil industries, are a renewable resource that have been found to be effective as supplemental cementitious materials in the production of a green engineered cementitious composite (Green-ECC) and high-strength concrete with the desired physical and chemical properties. These green building and construction materials provide the additional benefits of recycling waste that would otherwise be destined for landfill, while reducing energy consumption for cement production. Since the production of one tonne of cement results in the release of approximately one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere, every tonne of pozzolan effectively saves a tonne of pure cement, which will result in a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",2012
Use of Flexible Engineered Cementitious Composite in Buildings,Construction; engineered cementitious Composites (ECC); strain; flexibility; ductility; fibers; environment-friendliness; cost effectiveness; durability,,"This article describes the applications and benefits of a recently developed smart building material namely Engineered cementitious composite (ECC), also known as flexible or bendable concrete. Conventional concretes have a strain capacity of only 0.1 percent and are highly brittle and rigid. This lack of bendability is a major cause of failure under strain and has been a pushing factor in the development of an elegant material which is capable to exhibit an enhanced flexibility. An ECC has a strain capacity of more than 3 percent and thus acts more like a ductile metal rather than like a brittle glass. The aim of this paper is to highlight a probable success of ECC in terms of industrial and commercial use in Pakistan. With the introduction of flexible concrete in building technology, it is likely to have safer and more durable construction. The material is expected to display reduced detrimental impacts on the natural environment. A bendable concrete is composed of all the ingredients of a traditional concrete minus coarse aggregates or crushed stones and is reinforced with micromechanically designed polymer fibers. The mechanism of action of the micro-polymeric fibers in concrete has also been emphasized. The principles of mix designs of the mortar incorporating fibers to make an ECC have also been explained. It has also been mentioned in detail as how this technology can be used to enhance the flexibility of some modern concrete types like flowing concrete, self compacting concrete, and lightweight concrete. ECC is a green construction material. The possible benefits like environment friendliness, cost effectiveness, and durability have been also been elucidated in the paper.",2012
DETERMINATION OF DIELECTRIC PROPERTY OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL PRODUCTS USING A NOVEL RFID SENSOR,,CEMENT-BASED MATERIALS; RADIO LINK BUDGETS; PERMITTIVITY DETERMINATION; TAG; DESIGN; ANTENNAS; WALLS,"This paper presents a concept, by which radio frequency (RF) tags are employed as remotely read dielectric-property sensors to determine qualities of some construction material products (CMPs); e.g., light weight concrete (LWC), mortar specimens and concrete. Using the dependency of the read range of the passive RF identification (RFID) sensor system on the electromagnetic properties of CMPs near or in contact with RFID tags, the qualities of CMPs can be determined through their estimated dielectric properties. Theoretical formulation is provided, and numerical simulations are performed for optimal design of passive RFID tag antennas suitable for RFID sensors and for read-range calculations. In addition, a series of measurements is performed to measure read ranges of the passive RFID sensor system for an LWC as an example of CMPs, and these measured read ranges will be processed appropriately to inversely determine the dielectric constant of the LWC under test, which in turn provides information on its qualities. It is found that the novel RFID sensor can be employed to determine the dielectric properties of the LWC under test with reasonable accuracy.",2012

Use of Recycled Concrete in Hot Mix Asphalt and an ANN model for Prediction of Resilient Modulus,Asphalt; concrete; reuse; sustainable environment,HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; WASTE MATERIALS; PAVEMENTS; BITUMEN,"Environmental wastes increase more and more as a result of household and industrial waste production and landfill sites for those wastes are decreasing progressively. Environmental pollution would also be prevented by use of these wastes in various construction materials or structures. In this study, the effects of recycled concrete (RC) on the properties of Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) are investigated. For this purpose, RC was added to asphalt concrete in 10, 20,30 and 40 percent by weight of aggregate. The Marshall Stability (MS), flow resilient modulus (RM), and creep tests were applied to the specimens. MS and flows slightly decreased with the addition of RC. RM values for 10 percent RC was higher than the Control Specimen (CS) and the others. RM values decreased with increasing RC. RC specimens showed increases in terms of creep stiffness compared with CS. In addition, RM test results for different test conditions are evaluated by the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method. The results of the ANN model of RM with a coefficient of determination of 0.98 conformed very closely to those obtained by the experimental results. Consequently it can be used as an aggregate in RC concrete and the modelling can be made by means of ANN. In this way instead of being an environmental pollution, concrete waste can be used as a construction material in the context of the sustainable environment",2012
Impact of the surface characteristics of rainwater tank material on biofilm development,biofilm; clay; concrete; PVC; rainwater harvesting; water quality,BACTERIA; WATER,"In order to determine the impact of rainwater construction material on the development of a biofilm, three materials were tested: concrete, clay, and PVC. The biofilm attachment was initially more effective on clay coupons, but, after a period of three days, concrete coupons produced a greater quantity of biofilm than clay and PVC, in that order. The heterotrophic plate count in the rainwater indicated that this quantity tended to first increase following a rainfall, and then decrease. The new materials seemed to attach themselves to the existing biofilm on the wall and/or sediment in the form of small particles. The presence of fecal coliforms in the biofilm coupons was noted after major rainfall events, and this was correlated with the increase in fecal coliforms in the water. This study concluded that the most favorable support for biofilm development is concrete, clay, and PVC, in that order.",2012

Method: Thirty-two construction firms in the Midwestern United States completed the final survey questionnaire. Twelve different construction skilled trades participated included: general contractor, road, heavy and highway, concrete, electrical, carpentry, landscaping, plumbing, roofing, steel erection, street lighting/traffic signal, and utility construction. Total workforce of the participating companies numbered 11,118 employees. Result: More than 90% of the participants in the survey had a written safety program; however, the majority of the firms did not have a trade-specific ergonomic intervention. The survey revealed that construction constructors perceived safety (worker well-being) as a high priority in their company. This study suggested that construction skilled-trade jobs the construction worker to employ trade-specific hand tools and working body positions that may contribute to different types of WMSD risks, body parts injured, and injury sources. Possible practical construction trade-specific ergonomic solutions might be considered includinge: selection of ergonomic hand tools, reduction of weight of construction materials, and promotion of wellness exercises.

An Experimental Study of the Effects of Chloride Ions on the Corrosion Performance of Polymer Coated Rebar in Concrete Pavement,corrosion rate; coated rebar; polarization resistance; polymer coating,STEEL,"Construction materials have been greatly improved in recent years and reinforced concrete is no exception. However, corrosion inside reinforced concrete continues to be a primary problem in the construction field. This paper considers the corrosion rate of special kinds of steel inside reinforced concrete pavement. Corrosion is caused by chloride ions present in the deicing salts used to melt snow on pavement. These chloride ions cause endosmosis in the structure of steel and eventually destroy it. In order to prevent such corrosion, layers have been created to protect the steel. The authors use the polarization resistance method to check the ability of such barriers. The variables of this experimental study were four kinds of steel: black rebar, stainless steel 304 clad rebar, galvanized coated rebar A and galvanized coated rebar B. According to the test result, black steel corroded much more than the others with the presence of salt. Although the galvanized A rebar corroded more slowly than the galvanized B rebar in Ca(OH)(2) plus the threshold amount NaCl, the corroding resistance of the galvanized B rebar was better in the presence of 3.5% NaCl. However, of the four kinds of steel, the pure stainless steel 304 clad rebar proved to be the best in terms of corrosion resistance.",2012
Environmental friendly concrete production using municipal solid waste incineration materials,municipal solid waste incineration; fly ash; cement mortar; aggregate replacement; porosity; strength; durability,FLY-ASH; CEMENT SUBSTITUTE; BOTTOM ASH; REPLACEMENT; SLAG,"The building industry, especially construction materials' production, is a major user of the world's resources and together with energy production one of the most important sources of the CO2 production. Among building materials, concrete is element which is the second most consumed substance in the world, whereas only water is used in greater quantities. Apparently, almost one ton of concrete is used for each person in the world each year. From the point of view of ecological and sustainable aspects, concrete industry is now recognized as the largest consumer of natural resources and significant producer of waste. In order to preserve clean environment, there is a need for improvement of existing production technologies of concrete by transforming them into sustainable and environmentally friendly. Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) materials as fly ashes and bottom ashes have not dissimilar average chemical composition from that of coal fly ashes and slag from iron production. On that account one can assume possible use of MSWI materials as partial Portland cement replacement in concrete mix design or in a raw state as partial aggregate replacement. Since waste treatment represents serious problem for advanced as well as for developing countries, the use of MSWI materials in concrete production is beneficial for both ecological and financial reasons. Three kinds of MSWI fly ashes in state ""as received"" were characterized and their potential use as filler in cement based mortars was tested. The motivation of this utilization was to replace part of the fine aggregate dose in the mortars. All tested ashes made the mortars properties worse; the reasons and possible solutions are discussed.",2012
Analysis of damage and repair techniques of cracked structural elements in an underground part of a high RC building,,,"The aim of the paper is to present results of an investigation on the general technical condition of the underground structure that forms the foundation platform for a 200 metre high reinforced concrete building. After inspection of that bearing part of the building there were detected multiple cracks in its structural elements, i.e., slabs, walls and columns. In order to complete all the requirements necessary for evaluation of the technical condition of the building the following procedures were carried out: analysis of the structural design, examination of concrete and steel used for construction (material strength tests), and checking of the class of environmental concrete exposure (according to corrosion caused by carbonation and chlorides). After all these examinations were completed, causes of the damage and the technology of the concrete structural repair and protection were defined.",2012
Strengthening/retrofitting of masonry by using thin layers of Sprayed Strain-Hardening Cement-Based Composites (SSHCC),,,"This paper presents an overview of ongoing research at the Institute of Construction Materials of TU Dresden on the subject of strengthening of masonry by means of highly ductile cementitious materials with short polymeric fibres, so-called strain-hardening cement-based composites (SHCC). SHCC compositions with 1.8% and 2% by volume of PVA fibre were developed on the basis of appropriate rheological experiments on fresh concrete with subsequent spraying and of mechanical tests on hardened material samples produced both by spraying and casting. Afterwards, specimens built of three bricks (triplets) and reinforced with thin layers of sprayed SHCC were monotonically loaded in a deformation-controlled regime in order to investigate the strengthening effect of the applied SHCC layers. The results obtained from these experiments showed, that the static load bearing capacity of such triplets increased significantly, along with even more pronounced augmentation in energy absorption with a remaining high carrying capacity even at high deformations. In further laboratory tests, masonry walls were reinforced on both sides with sprayed SHCC layers and later subjected to cyclic shear loading. An evident increase in mechanical performance was observed in comparison to reference masonry walls with no strengthening layers. Additionally, two surface treatment methods (impregnation with water repellent agents and priming) were investigated for the effect on water absorption of the masonry surface, bond strength between masonry and applied SHCC layer, and finally, the workability of SHCC straight after its application (when finishing). The Karsten tube method was used to evaluate the surface water absorption for the chosen surface treatment methods in comparison to a reference brick face. Surface tension tests showed that impregnation with water repellent agents reduce the surface water intake, weakening the bond strength of the two materials. Priming, on the other hand, achieved a reduction in surface water absorption, an increase in bond strength and easier finishing of the sprayed composite.",2012
USING LEAN PRACTICES TO IMPROVE CURRENT CARBON LABELLING SCHEMES FOR CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS- A GENERAL FRAMEWORK,carbon emissions; climate change; sustainable development; prefabrication; lean production,,"The construction industry has considerable environmental impacts through the process of manufacturing building materials and building construction. Many environmental labelling programs have been introduced to the construction industry to measure the environmental impacts, including building up the environmental profiles for building materials. Although absolute measurements of the environmental impacts can be obtained by these labelling programs through detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies, relative measurements should not be overlooked to indicate the gap between the current and the ""leanest"" performance. The term ""lean"" is often used to describe a process with less wastes, materials, human effort, time, etc. The lean concept originates from the Toyota Production System and has been applied in the automobile industry for decades. This paper therefore aims to investigate the applicability of a relative measurement of the environmental impacts for building materials by introducing the concept of ""lean score"". The research aim is narrowed down by choosing the carbon labelling program and the precast concrete products as research objectives. The results indicate that a ""lean"" benchmark can be built to offer relative measurements of carbon emissions for precast concrete products. The lean score obtained from the benchmarking process provides the improving potential that can help the construction industry move towards sustainability. The results are also useful for regulatory bodies to establish national standards to measure the environmental impacts for building materials.",2012

Many alternatives to traditional laboratory instruction have been tested to improve educational benefits and to reduce academic input. This paper describes the benefits of laboratory classes run in an interactive competitive framework to enhance the teaching of structural engineering and construction materials. A creative framework that defines limits and quantifies performance encourages student engagement and allows reasonable control without stifling creativity. Two examples are presented in this paper: a wood bridge competition as part of an introductory structural engineering design course and a concrete technology competition within a structural concrete course. The educational benefits of this broad-based approach are compared with other laboratory methods. Course surveys suggest that students view this method of laboratory education positively when it is well integrated within an engineering degree course. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000081.

The Effect of Pumice Rate on the Gamma Absorption Parameters of Concrete,,ATTENUATION COEFFICIENTS; BARITE,"Since the technology concerning gamma radiation showed a rapid development, it became a necessity to be protected from it. One of the common shielding materials for this purpose is concrete. This study aims to give the effect of pumice rate on the gamma radiation attenuation coefficients of normal concrete (rho = 2.476 g cm(-3)) containing different rates of pumice mineral. Pumice, for which the Golcuk region in Isparta province is rich, is a volcanic originated spongy and porous mineral. Although it is a light material, it has a high comprehensive strength and heat resistance. So it became a common construction material in buildings. In the study, the variation of attenuation coefficients for concretes of different pumice rates were measured for 662, 1173 and 1332 keV photons using a NaI(Tl) detector. The experimental values were compared with the theoretical ones obtained by XCOM code.",2012

Experiences in Barcelona with the use of fibres in segmental linings,Cracking; Brittle failure; Optimal design; Precast segments; TBM; SFRC,TUNNEL LININGS; REINFORCED CONCRETE; STRUCTURAL RESPONSE; BEHAVIOR; SFRC,"This paper presents the most outstanding experiences regarding the use of fibres as the main reinforcement in precast segmental linings in the metropolitan area of Barcelona. It is known that the addition of structural fibres improves, on the one hand, the mechanical behaviour of the structure during its construction, especially in cases such as the thrust of the jacks, and on the other hand it leads to a reduction of the global costs by reducing the conventional passive reinforcement. The aim of this paper consists in presenting three real experiences that are representative of the application of FRC in urban tunnels and a design methodology to take into account the structural contribution of the fibres. Two particular cases of the application of this design method are presented. In the first case, the use of 25 kg/m(3) of fibres has led to a reduction of 70% of the conventional reinforcement initially proposed in the project. In the second one, which was planned to employ fibres but without considering its structural contribution, the parametric study reflected the possibility of reducing up to a 38% of the rebars adding 25 kg/m(3) of steel fibres in the concrete mixture. In light of good results, construction companies in Spain have become aware of the advantages of using fibres in these structures and have carried out experimental stretches. This attitude has also been influenced by the approval of the new Spanish Code, which includes the FRC as a construction material with design purposes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Test System for Defect Detection in Construction Materials with Ultrasonic Waves by Support Vector Machine and Neural Network,ultrasonic pulse velocity; defect detection; pattern recognition; support vector machine; neural network,IMPACT ACOUSTICS; REFLECTION,"This paper introduces a newly developed test system for structure inspection and evaluation of cement-based products by applying ultrasonic test with support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In other words, this paper represents a novel method based on SVM for defect detection, classification of number of defects, and identification of defect materials. With the system, pattern of ultrasonic waves for each case of specimen can be obtained from direct and indirect measurements. Machine learning algorithm called support vector machine and artificial neural network (ANN) are employed for classification and verification of the wave patterns obtained from different samples. By applying the system, the presence or absence of a defect in mortar can be identified. Moreover, the system can also classify the number of defects and identify the defect materials being inside the mortar. For classification, input features are extracted in different ways and the numbers of training sets are varied. Base on the results from SVM, the signals extracted in frequency domain gives better performance than time domain. Using a larger training set can give more satisfactory results. In this article, the methodology is explained and the classification results are discussed. The effectiveness of the developed test system is evaluated.

Effects of Polymer Additives on The Restrained Shrinkage of Concrete,Polymer modified concrete; restrained shrinkage; drying shrinkage,,"Nowadays, with the developments in technology, the properties of the concrete are improved. Although, its physical properties and relatively low cost make it the most widely used construction material, conventional Portland cement concrete has a number of limitations such as low flexural strength, low failure strain, susceptibility to frost damage and low resistance to chemicals. In certain situations, these problems can be solved by using materials which contain an organic polymer or resin in the place of or in conjunction with Portland cement. Especially, the restrained shrinkage of concrete forms cracks when the tensile stress which occurs due to the restraint is higher than the tensile strength of the concrete. In this study, the effect of the polymer additives on the restrained shrinkage of the concrete is studied. The restrained and drying shrinkages of the plain and polymer modified concretes are tested and the results are evaluated comparatively.",2012

Particularly, planting concrete makes it possible for plants to take roots through voids that exist in large quantities in porous concrete, and water and nutrients can be provided by using moistureretaining filler. In this research, planting polymer block for greening works by applying planting to porous polymer block utilizing unsaturated polyester resin and recycled aggregate was developed. The mechanical properties of porous polymer concrete depending on the binder contents and the growth properties of plants in planting polymer block applied coolseason grass and herbaceous plant were investigated.

Flowability of Polymer Concrete with the Electric Arc Furnace Slag Made by Rapid Cooling Method,Electric arc furnace slag; rapid cooling method; flowability,,"The electric arc furnace slag(EAFS) is a by-product produced during steel making process from iron scraps in the electric arc furnace. It has been usually treated by slow cooled method and mainly used as construction material after aging. This process is not economical due to needs for a long time of about 3 months and a broad open air-yard. However, new slag treatment technology have applied to real plant in Republic of Korea for last ten years, removed some defaults in the old method. This is the atomizing technology, which makes the rapidly cooled small spherical particles by scattering the melting slag to the open air by high speed air.

Effect of Fly Ash Fineness on the Activation of Geopolymer Concrete,Geopolymer; Alkaline activation; Fly ash; Fineness,CEMENT,"In the field of construction materials and particularly in concrete, cement is considered as a key element since it generates a strong and durable material through a simple hydration process. However, for many reasons (mainly economic and environmental) researchers are trying to find a new material that could replace cement or at least part of it as a binding agent in concrete. Regarding this issue, cement replacement materials like fly ash and slag have taken the lead during the last few decades. These materials have characteristics similar to cement but when it comes to the hydration they first need to be activated. For that, many studies were performed to find a way to activate these materials without using cement to produce what is called Geopolymer Concrete. The activation is simply based on preparing an ambient similar to the one produced by cement hydration. Hence, alkali activation is widely used to activate the polymerization reaction. On the other hand, when compared to ordinary concrete, producing geopolymer concrete is still complicated since it has no standard and needs several activation steps. In this work, fly ashes that are taken from three different sources in Turkey are used to produce geopolymer concrete. The study aims to compare the effect of fly ash characteristics, particularly their chemical composition and fineness, on the activation process.",2012
Recycled concrete aggregate as a base course material in Western Australian road,,,"Recycled crushed concrete and demolition materials have been trailed successfully as a road construction material in a number of locations in Western Australia, but industry acceptance of the material has been minimal. Specifications of such materials currently in use have been modified from commonly used specifications for new quarried products, and remarkably, there have been some doubts about the long term performance and quality control of such recycled products. This paper analyses the performance of recycled concrete pavements that have been constructed in Western Australia, and details the extensive laboratory testing program undertaken to model the product and compare its performance to conventional quarry products. Field testing demonstrates good quality control and performance of recycled crushed concrete and demolition materials superior to conventional quarry products and the laboratory results shows very close characteristics between both materials.",2012

Structural Assessment for High Concrete Pier with a Vertical Construction Error and Suggestion of the improvement measurement,,,"Slip-form construction is a construction method for tall structures, such as buildings, bridges, towers, offshore platforms and dams, in which concrete is poured into a continuously moving form. These forms serve as supporting walls strong enough to bear the concrete weight poured over top of it. Slip-form has been used for the construction of tall piers of long span bridges not only to reduce the construction period but also to ensure the safety The slip-form method, however, sometimes has showed several problems, such as vertical errors under construction or deflections of forms, from irregular loads by construction materials, workers or its weight, or unsettled friction or bond between concrete and forms. These include, but not limited to, problems in mechanical and hydraulic operations due to greater weight of steel form, problems in ensuring that the slip-form remains plumb i.e. the horizontal deviations do not exceed specified limits and certain other handling problems arising due to the weight of the form itself. This paper presents a case of construction errors that aroused during vertical slip-forming in the construction of bridge pier using steel as the slip-form. Moreover, it also includes field inspection, shape survey, structural assessment through the structural analysis and the measures taken against these errors. The most reasonable causes of these construction errors that may occur were estimated to weight and friction force of steel form. So, using of FRP form was suggested which is efficient in reduction of weight and friction force, therefore proving to be an excellent alternative to the steel slip-form",2012
Alumina addition influence on the polymer composites properties,,,"The civil construction sector has found use for a range of industrial waste products as substitutes that are as effective as standard construction materials but which have the bonus of providing an ecologically sound alternative for materials that would otherwise become an environmental concern. The use of waste materials in cement and polymer composites is a prime example of this practice. These composites display excellent mechanical properties but must be adapted to the combustibility properties. The study aimed to produce polymer concrete composites using waste alumina from the metallurgic industrial processing. The composites have an ortophtalic polyester resin as a binder and as aggregates river sand and fly ash. Two compositions were generated with two kinds of flame retardant waste, polishing alumina and a commercial alumina used in four different percentages: 15,30,45 and 60% in mass in relation to the resin. The samples were subjected to tests for flexural strength, temperature changes of 125, 225 and 325 C and porosity by mercury addition. Results were statistically analysed in order to evaluate the variance significance in relation to the studied properties. In this study composites displayed values of about 30 MPa for flexural strength. The statistical analysis showed that temperature changes, percentage of addition? and the interaction among these factors posed a great influence on the studied compositions in relation to the heating strength testing. In general terms, it can be said that the flame retardant waste, polishing alumina, is an efficient alternative as a substitute for trihydrated commercial alumina in the polymer concrete composites with the other components proposed in this study.",2012
The study of the properties of fly ash based concrete composites with various chemical admixtures,Fly ash; concrete; concrete strenght; X-ray fluorescence; thermal analysis,,"Technological developments in our society are still highly extensive nature and the forthcoming process of globalization affects the state of the environment significantly. Along with a slight increase in population, uncontrolled pumping of raw materials for production of materials and energy and urbanization of the environment, there is the increase of harmful emissions and waste generation. Mineral resources are limited considerably. The resources for feeding our growing population (the problem of drinking water and food) are limited as well as materials needed for construction of buildings, infrastructure development, and industry needed to ensure the people's welfare. This is also true for conventional raw materials for production of construction materials and fuel. One of the main challenges of the 21st century is oriented on the increasing effectiveness of the materials processing and significantly reduced energy usage. Because concrete is the most used building material in the world, the new approach consists in change in the design of concrete structures and in developing and implementing new concrete processing technologies based on cement reduction demand. Although new technologies are being developed to solve these problems, there is a viable solution for the present time utilization of alternative raw materials i.e. fly ash. The current annual worldwide production of by-products is estimated about 700 million tons of which 70 % is fly ash at least. Large quantities of fly ash are available at low costs around the world and the use of fly ash concrete seems to offer the best solution to reducing consumption of cement. The paper is aimed at the study of the mechanical properties (tensile flexural and compressive strengths) of hardened fly ash - concrete composites with various proportions of fly ash as well as the investigation of the chemical admixtures influence on the concrete properties.

Experimental study on strength and ductility of steel tubular stub columns filled with Geopolymeric Recycled Concrete,Geopolymeric Recycled Concrete (GRC); tubular stub column; recycled aggregate replacement ratio; strength; ductility,FLY-ASH; AGGREGATE CONCRETE; TECHNOLOGY; TESTS,"Geopolymeric Recycled Concrete (GRC) is a new construction material which takes environmental sustainability into account, by using alkali solution and fly ash to completely substitute Portland cement as well as by replacing natural coarse aggregate with recycled coarse aggregate. GRC could be used together with steel hollow sections to form composite section. There is very limited study on such GRC filled tubular sections. This paper presents an experimental study on GRC filled tubular stub columns. A total of 12 specimens were tested. The main parameters varied in the tests are: (1) two section sizes of square hollow sections (Bxt) with 200 mm x 6 mm and 150 mm x 5 mm; (2) different concrete types: GRC and Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC); (3) different Recycled Aggregate (RA) replacement ratios of 0%, 50% and 100%. The relationship of load versus axial strain was recorded and analysed to compare the ultimate strength and failure mechanism. Meanwhile, the ductility of the columns was investigated by a ductility index (DI). The results show that the ultimate strength decreased with increasing RA contents for both GRC and RAC filled columns. The influence of RA content on the strength was greater in GRC than that in RAC. The effect of RA content on the ductility of the columns was further investigated. Simulation method for predicting load versus strain relationship is discussed for RAC and GRC filled steel tubular columns with different RA replacement ratios.",2012
Release of heavy metals from construction materials,,LEACHING BEHAVIOR; FLY-ASH,"The civil engineering structures and elements, wherein concrete makes the principal component, have been in common use and can be found all around us. Since numerous waste materials and industrial by-products have been used in the production of cement and concrete, attention should be paid to the environmental impacts of contemporary construction materials. Within that area, it is especially important to evaluate the release of heavy metals to the aquatic environment and/or to the soil. The paper presents the test methods which are applicable in the assessment of the leaching level of heavy metals from the construction materials. Also, the rate of release was determined for chromium, copper, zinc, lead and nickel from concrete elements which had been produced with the use of Portland cement CEM I and slag cement CEM III/B.

DETERMINING PULL - OUT DEFORMATIONS OF BONDED METAL ANCHORS EMBEDDED IN CONCRETE BY MEANS OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY,Acquisition; Monitoring; Engineering; Measurement; Camera; Photogrammetry,,"Chemical anchorages are applied in many engineering implementations, particularly strengthening of reinforced concrete structures. During strengthening procedure; chemical anchorages should be tested, since they supply to transfer the load between existing construction elements and newly added elements. Therefore; the study of the quality of chemical anchorages is an important issue in construction materials science. In this context; the most important experiment is to determine the pull-out loads of embedded anchorage reinforcement by applying axial loads. In this study; it is aimed to determine the displacements of steel reinforcements, embedded into concrete by using chemical anchorages, while applying axial pulling loads. In order to determine the displacements and load - deformation graphs; starting conditions and every 10 bar pressure applied conditions of the steel reinforcements were captured by the cameras. The obtained images were evaluated by using photogrammetric software. Based on the photogrammetric post-processing results, the load - deformation graphs were plotted and the loads at loss of adhesion were determined.",2012
Comparison of batch leaching tests and influence of pH on the release of metals from construction and demolition wastes,Environmental aspects; Leaching behaviour; Construction and demolition waste; Recycled aggregates,UNBOUND ROAD SUBBASE; CONCRETE; DEBRIS; BEHAVIOR,"Construction and demolition wastes are suitable for use in road construction. However, leaching characterization of recycled materials is required to determine their pollutant potential and the consequence of their application in different scenarios. The motivation of this paper is derived from the increasing use of different leaching test methods. In Europe, the confusion resulting from the wide variety of tests used to evaluate environmental properties of construction materials implies that an evaluation of the current practices and the attempt to consolidate the approaches are required. Two equilibrium-based leaching tests (the Dutch test and the European standard) were conducted to assess the environmental impact of four recycled aggregates. Three natural limestone aggregates were used as controls. Both tests measure the potential release of hazardous elements under extreme conditions using different leaching parameters (L/S ratio, pH value and contact time). The results proved that pH is the most relevant factor on the assessment of the differences between leaching methods due to its strong control on the pollutant release. To classify the materials according to their environmental effects, the concentration limit values of the metals imposed by Council Decision 2003/33/EC were used as a reference. The comparison allowed the classification of the recycled aggregates as inert wastes, with the exception of the MR-2 aggregate, which was classified as non-hazardous material. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Compressive strength and creep of recycled HDPE used to manufacture polymeric piling,"High density polyethylene; Polymer; Pile; Viscoelastic; Viscoplastic; Monotonic, modulus; Thermoplastic; Mechanical properties; FRP; Green sustainable material",HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE; NONLINEAR MECHANICAL RESPONSE; COMPOSITE-MATERIALS; PLASTIC LUMBER; TEMPERATURE; BEHAVIOR; GEOMEMBRANES; DURABILITY; MODEL,"Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites represent an alternative construction material that can alleviate deterioration of steel, concrete, and timber piling in marine, water front, and aggressive environments. However, unlike conventional construction materials which have well documented creep behavior, there is virtually no reliable data on the creep behavior of FRP, particularly in compressive loading. In this study, an accelerated test method to predict the compressive creep of recycled HDPE used to manufacture piling is proposed. The method is based on the equivalence of strain energy density (SED) between conventional constant-stress creep tests and stress-strain tests, conducted at different strain rates. Good agreement between the creep rates obtained from a conventional test and SED predictions were achieved when two stress-strain experiments with strain rates differing by two or more orders of magnitude are used. Test results indicate the tested HDPE loaded in compression will creep by less than 1% in 100 years when loaded at an ultimate stress of 6.9 MPa (1000 psi). SED was also used as a basis for predicting the onset of tertiary creep. Finally, onset of tertiary creep was utilized for rational selection of the ultimate strength of viscoelastic materials, whose strength is inversely proportional to duration of loading. The ultimate strength of the recycled HDPE tested in this research ranged from 15 to 28 MPa (2200 to 4000 psi). However, the ultimate strength corresponding to 100 years of service was predicted to be 11.7 MPa (1700 psi) using SED, which represents 40-60% of the ultimate strength obtained from conventional stress-strain tests.

Application of Gray Relational Analysis for Chloride Permeability and Freeze-Thaw Resistance of High-Performance Concrete Containing Nanoparticles,Concrete; Construction materials; Durability; Data analysis,NANO-PARTICLES; PAVEMENT,"Many factors of mix proportion affect the chloride permeability and freeze-thaw resistance of high-performance concrete containing nanoparticles, including the dosages of cement, nanomaterials, mineral fine admixture, and chemical admixture and the water-binder and sand ratios. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of these factors on the chloride permeability and freeze-thaw resistance of high-performance concrete containing nanoparticles and determine which factors yield the greatest influence. The gray relational analysis method was used to calculate relational grades between the effect factors and the diffusion coefficient of Cl(-) and between the effect factors and the antifreezing durability coefficient. In addition, sequences showing degree of influence on chloride permeability and freeze-thaw resistance were obtained. The results indicate that among the seven selected parameters of mix proportion design, water-binder ratio, dosage of cement, and dosage of nanoparticles had the greatest influence on the chloride permeability and freeze-thaw resistance of high-performance concrete containing nanoparticles. To improve the antipermeability of Cl(-) and the freeze-thaw resistance of high-performance concrete containing nanoparticles, the water-binder ratio and dosages of cement and nanomaterials must be strictly controlled (i.e., the water-binder ratio decreased and the dosages of cement and nanomaterials increased).

Further, Portland cement is not the ideal binder for all construction applications, as it suffers from durability problems in particularly aggressive environments. Several alternative binders have been available for almost as long as Portland cement, yet have not been extensively used, and new ones are being developed. In this paper, four promising binders available as alternatives to Portland cement are discussed, namely calcium aluminate cement, calcium sulfoaluminate cement, alkali-activated binders, and supersulfated cements.

A floating platform of concrete for offshore wind turbine,,,"A floating platform concept is introduced in this paper for offshore wind turbine. A vertical cylinder on the top of an elliptical sphere forms the principal configuration of the platform. The analysis of the dynamic performance of an example platform with 5 MW wind turbine by means of the well-established linear theory for the dynamics of marine constructions in waves shows that the platform is able to secure the normal function of the wind turbine in waves up to rough sea state and has the required dynamic performance for survival in extreme waves by adopting a survival ballast condition. An important feature of this concept is that reinforced concrete can be used as cost-efficient construction material so that the service life, several times longer than similar steel constructions can be obtained despite of the marine corrosive and erosive environment. Thus, this kind of platform can become competitive in the economical, sustainable, and environment-friendly aspect. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics. [doi: 10.1063/1.3658434]",2011
Lumber-Boxed Concrete Structural System-Concept and Preliminary Analysis,Timber; Concrete; Stress strain; Stress blocks; Moment curvature,COMPOSITE BEAMS; LONG-TERM; BEHAVIOR; PERFORMANCE; CONNECTION; SHEAR,"Lumber has the advantages of being a lightweight construction material, easy to handle, and environmentally benign. However, large creep deflections and significant issues with sound transmission, particularly the footfall problem, generally limit lumber use to small spans and low-rise buildings. A concrete topping on lumber subfloors may mitigate some of these issues, but even with well-engineered wood systems, the spans are relatively short. In this study, a new structural system is analytically explored. Called a lumber-boxed concrete structural system, the dual system utilizes the positive attributes of both dimensional lumber and reinforced concrete; composite action is not a requirement of the system. A stress-block approach is developed to calculate strength and deformation behavior. An analytical stress-block-based moment-curvature analysis is performed on the lumber-boxed concrete structural elements. Results show that the structural lumber-boxed concrete members may have better strength and ductility capacities when compared to an equivalent size ordinary reinforced concrete member.

Chemical Reaction of Waterproofing Admixtures on the Corrosion Behaviour of Reinforced Cement Concrete,Admixtures; Concrete; Corrosion; Durability; Permeability; Waterproofing,,This paper deals about the corrosion behaviour of reinforced cement concrete using waterproofing admixtures. This addition of waterproofing admixtures turns concrete into a construction material in harmony with sustainable building development. The addition of waterproofing chemicals also increases the various strength of concrete. These studies were carried out by conducting accelerated corrosion test over the concrete specimen with and without chemicals for various dosages and curing period of 28 days. The cubical specimens of size 150 mm x 150 mm x 150 mm have been taken for this test. The contribution of waterproofing admixtures was found more in the corrosion behaviour of reinforced cement concrete since it reduces the permeability and improves the corrosion resistance.,2011
Effects of construction materials and design of lake and stream banks on climbing ability of frogs and salamanders,Ecological indicators; Bank substrate; Climbing ability; Amphibian; Hynobius arisanensis,DECLINING AMPHIBIAN POPULATIONS; IMPACTS; TAIWAN; FLUCTUATIONS; EXTINCTIONS; GONE,"With the increasing development of many areas in recent years, concrete structures are often installed along water bodies in order to protect the safety of local residents. However, effects of these concrete structures on environments and mobility of amphibian species are still unknown. The construction of concrete banks along rivers associated with human development has become a serious problem in Taiwan. Most ecosystems used by amphibians are lakes and stream banks, yet no related design solutions to accommodate the needs of amphibians have been used in Taiwan. In this research, we selected eight species of amphibians and investigated their climbing abilities in an effort to improve lake and river bank designs. We evaluated their climbing abilities on five angles of bank slopes, identified relationships between an amphibian's climbing ability and different surface substrates of banks, i.e. Japanese silvergrass (Miscanthus floridulus) mixed with moss, cobblestone, wood (Philippine mahogany), clay, and concrete, under high humidity and different temperatures to simulate changes across the four seasons. The results showed that climbing ability of these amphibians is slightly decreased at low temperatures. For example, on a 450 slope in winter, the average climbing ability decreased 8% from results in summer. The upper limit of bank design slope suitable for Hynobius arisanensis on rock and wood surfaces is 45 degrees. For amphibians from alpine areas in Taiwan, such as Bufo bankorensis, the maximum suitable slope is 15 degrees. With concrete as the water bank material, slopes <30 degrees are preferable. The results presented here can serve as a reference for technicians involved in future ecological engineering designs of banks throughout the world. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2011
Utilization of calcite and waste glass for preparing construction materials with a low environmental load,Calcite; Glass; Hydrothermal treatment; Porous materials,CEMENT; SOLIDIFICATION; SEPARATION; EXTRACTION; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; QUARTZ; LIME,"In this study, porous calcite materials are hydrothermally treated at 200 degrees C using powder compacts consisting of calcite and glasses composed of silica-rich soda-lime. After treatment, the glasses are converted into calcium aluminosilicate hydrates, such as zeolite phases, which increase their strength. The porosity and morphology of new deposits of hydrothermally solidified materials depend up on the chemical composition of glass. The use of calcite and glass in the hydrothermal treatment plays an important role in the solidification of calcite without thermal decomposition. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011
"Optimizing CO2 emissions from heating and cooling and from the materials used in residential buildings, depending on their geometric characteristics",Energy consumption; Heating and cooling demand; Building shape; CO2 emissions,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; THERMAL PERFORMANCE; ENERGY; IMPACT; SHAPE,"The objective of this research was to obtain the environmentally optimal design of a building with the following starting conditions: constant constructed surface, constant volume, square floor layout, and a variable number of floors. For this purpose, the study evaluated the impact of CO2 emissions stemming from the energy needed to maintain the building at a constant temperature of 19 degrees C in winter and 25 degrees C in the summer. Furthermore, one of the results was the CO2 emissions curve from the manufacturing of the materials used in the construction of the building and the building envelope. The energy consumed to cool and heat the building was calculated by means of the simplified method specified in the ISO/DIS/13790 standard. The building was thus regarded as a monozone with the consequent simplifications. The matrix method was used to calculate the building's structure for the purpose of obtaining the CO2 emissions from the concrete and steel needed to construct it. The result obtained was the curve representing the CO2 emissions, depending on building height. The source of these emissions was the energy consumption from heating and cooling as well as from the manufacture of construction materials. The results of the study indicated that the useful life of the building was a very important factor to take into account. The methodology used in this study could be used by building designers to design buildings with an optimal height for the reduction of negative environmental impacts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Life cycle environmental loads and economic efficiencies of apartment buildings built with plaster board drywall,Plaster board drywall; Life cycle; CO2; Cost,DECISION-MAKING; SOUTH-KOREA; COST; LCC,"Due to the ease of remodeling apartment buildings, as well as the increased lifespans and performances required of apartment buildings, the demand for new plaster board drywall materials with outstanding flexibility is growing, and the importance of assessing the associated environmental load is increasing. This study evaluates the CO2 generated during the life cycle of a building (LCCO2) and its economic efficiency to assess the environmental loads and costs of buildings that use plaster board drywall. A typical concrete bearing wall structure for an apartment building was defined as case 1, and comparisons were performed with alternative samples (cases 2, 3, and 4) containing different ratios of plaster board drywall on top of case 1. The structural safety of each sample building was considered along with the legal incentives according to the use of variable type wall. In addition, life cycle assessments of both CO2 and economic efficiency were conducted according to stage, including the construction stage, operation/maintenance stage, and demolition/waste stage. Data including quantity of construction material, amount of energy usage, repair rate, and repair period (all of which are required during each stage of assessment) were utilized for the assessment of both CO2 and economic efficiency. As a result, in flat-type structures, the CO2 reduction rates of cases 2, 3, and 4 compared to case 1 were 1.0%, 4.5%, and 5.4%, respectively. In the assessment of cost, the reduction rates compared to case 1 were -0.01%, 5.8%, and 6.0%, respectively. Also, in the tower-type structure, the CO2 reduction rates of cases 2, 3, and 4 compared to case 1 were 1.3%, 4.9%, and 5.5%, respectively. In cost assessment, the reduction rates compared to case 1 were -1.1%, 3.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011

The damage was widespread due to uncontrolled construction, poor material quality, and lack of rigorous engineering design. Post-event reconnaissance has brought to light serious deficiencies in these areas. Residential buildings in Haiti are typically constructed by their owners, who may or may not have the skills or resources to build a structure that is earthquake-safe. Few structures are designed by engineering professionals or are inspected for quality of construction. The two most common construction materials are masonry block and reinforced concrete. Masonry blocks, concrete cylinders, and reinforcing steel were taken from Haiti and tested in the United States. The concrete and masonry were shown to be of low strength and quality. The steel samples show expected strength properties with some specimens having reduced ductility due to bending. Building performance is demonstrated by reconnaissance photographs and case studies of the structures inspected by reconnaissance team members. [DOI:10.1193/1.3637031]",2011
"Assessment of Residential Housing in Leogane, Haiti, and Identification of Needs for Rebuilding after the January 2010 Earthquake",construction components; design engineering; disasters; earthquake engineering; failure analysis; maintenance engineering; reinforced concrete; structural engineering,,"Two months after the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, a reconnaissance team from the University of Notre Dame traveled to Leacuteogacircumflexne with a follow up trip in August 2010. The team sought to determine the failure modes for residential housing in the area and survey the structural systems, construction materials, building practices, and non-engineering constraints that dictate these practices. The failure modes observed were commonly initiated from undersized/under-reinforced columns, though even structures with adequately sized columns sustained significant damage due to shear forces transferred by stiff but brittle unreinforced masonry walls. Inadequate seismic detailing of reinforced concrete elements, deficient materials and construction practices, and lack of seismic considerations in the design of structural systems with sufficient lateral interconnectivity were also observed. Finally, strategies now being pursued by the authors will be showcased in an effort to develop multihazard-resilient housing that can be sustained locally. [DOI:10.1193/1.3637942]",2011
BEHAVIOR OF TRITIATED WATER ON CONCRETE MATERIALS,,TRITIUM; DIFFUSION; SORPTION; CEMENT; VAPOR,"A fusion reactor requires high levels of safety and public acceptability, so safe confinement of tritium is one of the key issues. Tritium must be well controlled with no excessive release to environment and no excessive workers exposure. Especially, the hot cell and tritium facility of ITER will use various construction materials such as the concrete and the organic materials. Since the concrete materials will be contaminated by tritium compared with the metal materials such as SS, it is very important to study the tritium behavior on the materials from the viewpoint of the excessive exposure protection to workers. Therefore, in order to understand the tritium behavior on the concrete materials, the sorption and desorption experiment was carried out as a function of the exposure time and temperature of water in the desorption experiment. The used samples were cement paste, mortar and concrete. These samples were exposed into 740 similar to 1110 Bq/cm(3) of tritiated water vapor at room temperature. The exposed time was from a day to several weeks. The exposed samples for a certain period were soaked into water at 277 K, 298 K and 343 K, and then the water was periodically measured by Liquid Scintillation Counter (LSC) and the amount of tritium sorbed on the concrete materials were evaluated. The amount of the tritium sorbed in the concrete materials reached equilibrium less than 2 months. In the desorption behavior from concrete materials to water at 277K, 298K and 343K, the tritium sorbed in the concrete materials was desorbed about 99 % for 2 days at 343 K of water. However, the tritium desorption from concrete materials was sufficiently detected though 3 months passed. In addition, the tritium profile on the surface concrete materials was measured by a tritium imaging plate.",2011
Cement fraction effect on EIS response of chloride migration tests,,MONITORING STEEL CORROSION; ELECTRICAL DOUBLE-LAYER; IMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; PART II; DIFFUSION; TRANSPORT; PASTE; IONS,"This paper highlights the electrochemical phenomena that occur during chloride migration tests on construction materials. For this purpose, investigations by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out on cementitious and non-cementitious materials. Materials deals with cement paste, mortar and concrete on one hand, and two types of terracotta, pink and brown, on the other hand. The results obtained for these two types of construction materials show that the electrical charge distribution within the material during the chloride transfer depends on the volumic cement proportion in the material. This was highlighted by the establishment of a plateau region at low frequencies of the EIS in the Nyquist plot. Moreover, the extension of the plateau region is closely linked to the volumic cement proportion. These electrical charges could reduce the transfer electrical current, which distorts the estimation of the diffusion coefficients obtained with accelerated tests.",2011
Quantification of uncertainty of experimental measurement in leaching test on cement-based materials,Confidence interval; Uncertainty; Leaching test; Cement-based materials; Meat and bone meal,GENERALIZED CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; PORTLAND-CEMENT; FLY-ASH; DISTRIBUTIONS; LEACHABILITY; CONCRETE; WASTE,"When mineral wastes are reused in construction materials, a current practice is to evaluate their environmental impact using standard leaching test. However, due to the uncertainty of the measurement, it is usually quite difficult to estimate the pollutant potential compared to other materials or threshold limits. The aim of this paper is to give a quantitative evaluation of the uncertainty of leachate concentrations of cement-based materials, as a function of the number of test performed. The relative standard deviations and relative confidence intervals are determined using experimental data in order to give a global evaluation of the uncertainty of leachate concentrations (determination of total relative standard deviation). Various combinations were realized in order to point out the origin of large dispersion of the results (determination of relative standard deviation linked to analytical measured and to leaching procedure), generalisation was suggested and the results were compared to literature. An actual example was given about the introduction of residue (meat and bone meal bottom ash - MBM-BA) in mortar, leaching tests were carried out on various samples with and without residue MBM-BA. In conclusion large dispersion were observed and mainly due to heterogeneity of materials. So heightened attention needed to analyse leaching result on cement-based materials and further more other tests (e.g. ecotoxicology) should be performed to evaluate the environmental effect of these materials.

Microstructure-linked strength properties and impact response of conventional and recycled concrete reinforced with steel and synthetic macro fibres,Incinerator bottom ash; Waste management; Microstructure; Mechanical behaviour; Toughness; Impact resistance,INCINERATOR BOTTOM ASH; AGGREGATE; RESISTANCE,"The effectiveness of the same volume of steel and synthetic macro fibres on impact resistance and microstructure associated mechanical behaviour is studied for concretes made with two different coarse aggregates-gravel and incinerator bottom ash (IBA). The microstructure-strength relationships were analyzed via electron microscopy and X-ray computed tomography (CT). The analysis indicated that increased paste strength was not so significant for the mix properties of plain IBA concrete as extensive cracks through the aggregate took place likely due to a reduced grain-grain interlocking and inter-particle friction as a result of the distinct pore structure, and fibre orientation in gravel concrete produced a line of weakness for failure to take place along. The results also show that the increase with the steel fibre inclusion in the post-peak stress, absorbed energy values, impact life for IBA concrete is much higher than those for gravel concrete. Overall, the research suggests that fibre-reinforced IBA concrete would be very promising as a multifunctional construction material. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011
An overview of techniques based on biomimetics for sustainable development of concrete,Biodeposition; biomimetics; biomineralization; concrete; microorganisms,CARBONATE PRECIPITATION; LIMESTONE; BACTERIA; STRENGTH; MORTAR,"Biomimetics is a field of science that studies biological processes for effectively using them in the development of innovative engineering materials and systems. It is a new field of emergence in materials science and engineering in which lessons learned from biology form the basis for evolution of novel technological materials. Biomimetics is finding application in diverse areas ranging from micro/nano electronics to civil/structural engineering. This article presents a critical review of the literature on biomimetics in civil engineering and its application for the development of sustainable materials in the construction industry. It includes various methodologies such as biodeposition, which has influenced material evolution, and biomineralization, which is a complex phenomenon by which organisms form minerals seen in various geothermal systems. The article deals with the initial usage of Bacillus pasteurii for filling up the pores for crack remediation and research work on it by changing the nutrient source and strain improvement of the same towards increasing the strength of concrete. The article also discusses a new type of thermophilic anaerobic microorganism belonging to Shewanella species, which when added to concrete, has shown to increase the strength of the concrete. This is due to growth of filler material within the pores of the cement-sand matrix. Thus, there is ample scope for development of biomimetics-based sustainable construction materials.",2011
A New ultrasonic signal processing scheme for detecting echoes of different spectral characteristics in concrete using empirical mode decomposition,non-destructive testing; Empirical Mode Decomposition; polarity thresholding; Coherent Noise; prism technique,,"In this work, a new signal processing scheme is proposed to improve ultrasonic echoes detection in concrete, a construction material and inhomogeneous propagation medium, in which the backscattering and the grain noise mask the useful signals. Firstly, the time-domain ultrasonic signal is measured. Then the original signal is separated into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) using Empirical Mode Decomposition. Secondly, the Fourier analysis is performed on each IMF. Examining the behaviors of the IMFs in the time and frequency domain, one can judge which IMF represents noise, echoes wave. Then we use nonlinear processing techniques to recombine the selected IMFs. Experimental results are presented and analyzed on a trapezoidal concrete/mortar/cement-paste prism specimen, showing that the proposed technique has an excellent performance. The improvement in defect detection was experimentally verified too on a prism based specimen of mortar with artificial defect.",2011
Decisions on recycling: Construction stakeholders' decisions regarding recycled mineral construction materials,Construction and demolition waste; Recycled mineral construction materials; Recycling behavior; Decision-making; Analytical hierarchy process,ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; DEMOLITION WASTE; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; AGGREGATE; CONCRETE; BEHAVIOR; INDUSTRY; DEBRIS; MODEL,"Construction and demolition (C&D) waste, being already the largest waste fraction in industrialized countries, is expected to increase in the future. C&D waste recycling has been considered to be a valuable option not only for minimizing C&D waste streams to landfills but also for mitigating primary mineral resource depletion. Even though the use of recycled mineral construction materials (RMCM) is regulated and successful application examples are available, construction stakeholders do not yet broadly apply them. Although various criteria hindering a transition towards a broader application of RMCM have been identified, it is yet unknown how these criteria differ among decisions, stakeholders and applications. We therefore analyze construction stakeholders' behavior, and decision-making regarding RMCM for the construction material market in Switzerland. Stakeholders' decision-making was quantified with the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in a survey in combination with their behavior. The results demonstrate the importance of stakeholder interaction, i.e. most stakeholders decide which material to apply based on interaction with other stakeholders e.g., recommendations and specifications. However, the initial general specification by awarding authorities that construction should be sustainable has little relevance to the subsequent material decisions. On the contrary the role of the recommendation of engineers, have a high impact on the subsequent decisions by the other stakeholders. Results also confirm that RMCM are broadly accepted in civil engineering (CE), whereas in structural engineering (SE) RMCM are still a niche product. The good alignment of the outcome of decision modeling with observed behavior shows the usefulness of analyzing decision-making with AHP. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2011

This study examined the effect of calcite precipitation induced by Sporosarcina pasteurii (Bp M-3) on parameters affecting the durability of concrete or mortar. An inexpensive industrial waste, corn steep liquor (CSL), from starch industry was used as nutrient source for the growth of bacteria and calcite production, and the results obtained with CSL were compared with those of the standard commercial medium. Bacterial deposition of a layer of calcite on the surface of the specimens resulted in substantial decrease of water uptake, permeability, and chloride penetration compared with control specimens without bacteria. The results obtained with CSL medium were comparable to those obtained with standard medium, indicating the economization of the biocalcification process. The results suggest that calcifying bacteria play an important role in enhancing the durability of concrete structures.",2011
"ASSESSMENT OF (SR)-S-90 AND (CS)-C-137 PENETRATION INTO REINFORCED CONCRETE (EXTENT OF ""DEEPENING"") UNDER NATURAL ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS","Cs-137; Sr-90, Chernobyl; contamination, environmental",,"When assessing the feasibility of remediation following the detonation of a radiological dispersion device or improvised nuclear device in a large city, several issues should be considered, including the levels and characteristics of the radioactive contamination, the availability of resources required for decontamination and the planned future use of the city's structures and buildings. Currently, little is known about radionuclide penetration into construction materials in an urban environment. Knowledge in this area would be useful when considering costs of a thorough decontamination of buildings, artificial structures and roads in an affected urban environment. Pripyat, a city substantially contaminated by the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident in April 1986, may provide some answers. The main objective of this study was to assess the depth of Sr-90 and Cs-137 penetration into reinforced concrete structures in a highly contaminated urban environment under natural weather conditions. Thirteen reinforced concrete core samples were obtained from external surfaces of a contaminated building in Pripyat. The concrete cores were drilled to obtain sample layers of 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 mm. Both Sr-90 and Cs-137 were detected in the entire 0-50 mm profile of the reinforced cores sampled. In most of the cores, over 90% of the total Cs-137 inventory and 70% of the total Sr-90 inventory was found in the first 0-5 mm layer of the reinforced concrete. Strontium-90 (Sr-90) had penetrated markedly deeper into the reinforced concrete structures than Cs-137. Health Phys. 101(3):311-320; 2011",2011

One is the utilisation of sludge from the treatment of wastewater. The other is the modification of the mechanical properties of concrete. The sludge was subjected to two series of treatments. In one series, coagulants were used, including ferrous sulphate, aluminium sulphate or aluminium polyhydroxychloride. In the other series, an electrochemical treatment was applied with several starting values of pH. Then, concretes consisting of a cement matrix, silica sand, marble and one of the sludges were developed. Specimens without sludge were prepared for comparison. Curing times and aggregate concentrations were varied. The compressive strength, compressive strain at yield point, and static and dynamic elastic moduli were determined. Diagrams of the compressive strength and compressive strain at the yield point as a function of time passed through the minima as a function of time for concretes containing sludge; therefore, the presence of sludge has beneficial effects on the long term properties. Some morphological changes caused by the presence of sludge are seen in scanning electron microscopy. A way of utilising sludge is thus provided together with a way to improve the compressive strain at yield point of concrete. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2011
Managing the Embodied Carbon of Precast Concrete Columns,Life cycles; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Precast concrete,,"With the rising recognition of global climate change, the term CO(2) emissions is now part of everyday language. The construction industry plays a significant role in economic growth both directly through its activities and indirectly through the provision of buildings and infrastructures for the smooth functioning of businesses. However, this industry is now highly challenged for its detrimental effect on carbon neutral by consuming materials and energy. Research has been conducted to estimate the embodied carbon of construction materials around the world, such as cement, aggregates, aluminum, and steel. These research findings provided fundamental support in estimating the embodied carbon of precast concrete products. This study investigates the production cycle and estimates the embodied carbon of precast concrete columns, which are typically adopted in the Singapore construction industry, where there is a large demand in public housing projects. The results indicate that 609.59 kg of CO(2) is emitted in the production cycle of a specific type of precast concrete column. Knowing the embodied carbon of precast concrete columns, regulatory bodies are able to provide further recommendations toward sustainable construction. Research institutes can also benefit from this study to conduct further estimation of embodied carbon of other precast concrete products and finally complete the carbon inventory for the construction industry.

Performance of 100% Fly Ash Concrete with Recycled Glass Aggregate,aggregates; durability; fly ash; glass; mechanical properties; recycling; structural performance; sustainable development,ALKALI-SILICA REACTION; WASTE GLASS; EXPANSION; SYSTEMS,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world, and with the ever-increasing population, the use of concrete is expected to increase substantially. The environmental impacts of using concrete as a construction material are significant, ranging from the CO(2) emitted during its production and transportation, to the disturbance of virgin land for the extraction of raw materials from which it is produced. Therefore, there is a great need for alternative green materials for use in construction. Furthermore, if these green materials are generated from common waste streams, the environmental benefits are twofold: it will reduce the impact from the manufacturing of building materials and reduce the stockpiling of common waste products. This project realized both of these benefits through the use of fly ash as a replacement for 100% of the portland cement in concrete and the use of recycled pulverized glass as a replacement for traditional aggregate. This paper highlights significant findings from a research effort conducted at Montana State University (MS U) focused on the use of 100% fly ash concrete with recycled glass aggregate.

Graffitists do not care about the type of substrate material. In particular porous materials cause great difficulties in the removal of graffiti. In order to protect construction material surfaces and to aid the cleaning from graffiti, anti-graffiti systems (AGS) were developed in recent years. A new method for testing the cleaning efficacy and the durability of AGS was initiated by BASt together with technical delivery guidelines.

Proportioning of Steel Fibre Reinforced Concrete Mixes for Pavement Construction and Their Impact on Environment and Cost,steel fibre reinforced concrete; life cycle assessment; tire recycling,,"Steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) is a construction material investigated for more than 40 years including for pavement applications. A number of studies have demonstrated the technical merits of SFRC pavements over conventional concrete pavements; however little work has been carried out on the environmental and economical impact of SFRC during the pavement's life cycle. Therefore, extended research was undertaken within the framework of the EU funded project ""EcoLanes"" to estimate the environmental and economical loadings of SFRC pavements. The innovative concept of the project is the use of recycled steel tyre-cord wire as concrete fibre reinforcement, which provides additional environmental benefits for tyre recycling over landfilling. Within the project framework a demonstration of a steel-fibre-reinforced roller-compacted concrete (SFR-RCC) pavement was constructed in a rural area in Cyprus. In order to assess the economical and environmental picture of the demonstration pavement, life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) studies were undertaken, which also compared the under study pavement design with four conventional alternatives. The main output of the studies is that SFR-RCC is more environmentally and economically sustainable than others. In addition, various concrete mix designs were investigated by considering parameters such as fibre type and dosage, cement type, and transportation distances to the construction site. Fibre dosage has been highlighted as a crucial factor compared with economical and environmental loadings in SFR-RCC pavement construction.",2011

FEASIBILITY STUDY OF CEMENT COMPOSITES WITH PARA WOOD PARTICLE WASTES: STRENGTH AND DURABILITY,Strength; Durability; Composite; Para Wood; Particles; Waste; Cement,CONCRETE; AGGREGATE; SAWDUST; GLASS; ASH,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential use of Para wood particle wastes and cement for producing the cement composite as a new environmental friendly construction material. Strength and durability of cement composites mixed with different mix proportions of Para wood particles (PWP) were evaluated and compared with those of control samples (ordinary Portland cement). To study property degradation, the cement composite test samples were determined under different aging conditions. Three different conditioning schemes including: 1) seawater immersion at room temperature, 2) alkaline solution immersion at room temperature and 3) elevated temperatures were considered in this study. The experimental results show that the average compressive strength and elastic modulus of the cement composites mixed with PWP decreased with the increasing of PWP content. In addition, the average compressive strength of cement composites mixed with PWP aged in alkaline and salt solutions had a similar trend as cement composites with mixed PWP (normal curing). For temperature effect, the average compressive strength significantly dropped between 100 C and 150 C. The experimental results present a potential use of Para wood particle waste in cement composites.

"Towards a sustainable concrete: ""sandless"" concrete",concrete; durability; mechanical properties; sand; sustainability,FLY-ASH; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STRENGTH; SANDS,"As a step towards ensuring the sustainability of concrete as a construction material, an investigation was carried out on the mechanical and durability properties of concrete made without natural sand, termed ""sandless"" concrete, and with cement partially replaced by fly ash. Four groups of concrete mixes, with water-cement (w/c) ratios of 0.40, 0.45, 0.50 and 0.55, respectively, were studied. For each w/c ratio, there were six mixes with 0, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of cement content replaced by fly ash by mass, and one normal concrete mix containing natural sand. The difference in mechanical properties between normal and ""sandless"" concrete was not significant. ""Sandless"" concrete mixes with cement replaced by fly ash by <30% showed comparable compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths as those without fly ash. However, the elastic modulus was reduced with the incorporation of fly ash. In addition, use of fly ash led to reduced drying shrinkage of ""sandless"" concrete, and significantly improved the resistance to chloride ion penetration. The resistance to sulfate attack, on the other hand, seemed to decrease with higher fly ash content. From the study, it appears that ""sandless"" concrete with cement replaced by fly ash up to 30% could be considered for structural applications.",2011
An experimental study on the characteristics of chemically synthesized nano-cement for carbon dioxide reduction,CO(2) reduction; Chemical synthesis; Alkali activation; Compressive strength; Highly functional construction material,BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; ZEOLITE-Y; ACTIVATION; SIZE,"Portland cement is the essential binding agent in concrete. This cement is becoming a principal factor in air pollution because of the creation of CO(2) during its manufacture. The exhaustion of the natural resources needed for Portland cement production is also an issue. Therefore, a substitute material for this type of cement is needed. Nano-scale materials are of great interest due to their unique optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. These properties are strongly dependent on the sizes and shapes of the particles, and, therefore, it is important to be able to develop a construction route which retains the excellent properties of the nano-sized material. The purpose of this study was to synthesize nano-powder as a substitute for cement using a chemical method. Particle size, SEM, EDX, and porosity tests were conducted. This study investigated the compressive strengths of concretes with various compositions. Specimens were tested for compressive strength three, seven, 14, and 28 days after manufacture. In the results of this study, the medium-sized (50% by weight) nano-cement particles created via chemical synthesis were less than 168 nm in size, and the compressive strength of the mortar prepared using these nanoparticles was 53.9 MPa.",2011
Bond strength of reinforcing steel embedded in fly ash-based geopolymer concrete,Bond strength; Geopolymer concrete; Pull-out test; Splitting tensile strength; Steel reinforcement,ENGINEERING PROPERTIES; BARS; PERFORMANCE; COLUMNS; SPLICES,"Geopolymer concrete (GPC) is an emerging construction material that uses a by-product material such as fly ash as a complete substitute for cement. This paper evaluates the bond strength of fly ash based geopolymer concrete with reinforcing steel. Pull-out test in accordance with the ASTM A944 Standard was carried out on 24 geopolymer concrete and 24 ordinary Portland cement (OPC) concrete beam-end specimens, and the bond strengths of the two types of concrete were compared. The compressive strength of geopolymer concrete varied from 25 to 39 MPa. The other test parameters were concrete cover and bar diameter. The reinforcing steel was 20 mm and 24 mm diameter 500 MPa steel deformed bars. The concrete cover to bar diameter ratio varied from 1.71 to 3.62. Failure occurred with the splitting of concrete in the region bonded with the steel bar, in both geopolymer and OPC concrete specimens. Comparison of the test results shows that geopolymer concrete has higher bond strength than OPC concrete. This is because of the higher splitting tensile strength of geopolymer concrete than of OPC concrete of the same compressive strength. A comparison between the splitting tensile strengths of OPC and geopolymer concrete of compressive strengths ranging from 25 to 89 MPa shows that geopolymer concrete has higher splitting tensile strength than OPC concrete. This suggests that the existing analytical expressions for bond strength of OPC concrete can be conservatively used for calculation of bond strength of geopolymer concrete with reinforcing steel.",2011
Electrokinetic decontamination of heavy metals in construction materials: contribution of the different parameters to the global efficiency,Electrokinetic decontamination; Relative weight; Contribution of parameters; Construction materials; Zeta potential; Heavy metals; Enhancing electrolytes; Mortar; Brick,CHELATING-AGENTS; CONCRETE; MIGRATION; CESIUM,"To discriminate between the relative weights of each factor involved in the global process of an electrokinetic treatment for remediation, mortar and brick contaminated with Cs, Sr, Co, Cd and Cu were submitted to electrokinetic treatments with different enhancing electrolytes (distilled water, Na-2-EDTA, oxalic acid and citric acid), and the efficiency was analysed in function of the parameters involved in the process. The data obtained in this research, a matrix including 40 cases, have been correlated for the decontamination percentage in function of the key variables of the treatment, and the best correlation found, able to explain a variance of the 78.5% of the data, was a non linear exponential grow regression. An order in the weight of the contributions has been established that, from bigger to smaller contribution, is: constants of chelation equilibriums > precipitation as hydroxide constants > zeta potential > conductivity of the catholyte > pH catholyte > diffusion coefficient > pH of the material.",2011
"The ShakeOut Scenario: Meeting the Needs for Construction Aggregates, Asphalt, and Concrete",,,"An M(w) 7.8 earthquake as described in the Shake Out Scenario would cause significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. Over 6 million tons of newly mined aggregate would be used for emergency repairs and for reconstruction in the five years following the event. This aggregate would be applied mostly in the form of concrete for buildings and bridges, asphalt or concrete for pavement, and unbound gravel for applications such as base course that goes under highway pavement and backfilling for foundations and pipelines. There are over 450 aggregate, concrete, and asphalt plants in the affected area, some of which would be heavily damaged. Meeting the increased demand for construction materials would require readily available permitted reserves, functioning production facilities, a supply of cement and asphalt, a source of water, gas, and electricity, and a trained workforce. Prudent advance preparations would facilitate a timely emergency response and reconstruction following such an earthquake. [DOT: 10.1193/1.3570679]",2011
Development and Study of the Strength of Self-Compacting Mortar Mixes Using Local Materials,Self-compacting mortar; Rice husk ash; Quarry dust; Rheology and compressive strength,RICE HUSK ASH; SCC,"Concrete is a globally accepted construction material in all types of civil engineering structures. The increase in construction has brought heavy demand for ingredients of concrete such as cement and sand, and these materials are becoming costly and scarce. The cost of cement is also steadily increasing. With ever-increasing environmental problems because of industrial waste products comes a great need to use these products in an appropriate manner to reduce health and environmental problems. Rice husk ash (RHA) and quarry dust (QD) are two such waste materials, the use of which in the production of concrete may prove advantageous in an agriculture-driven economy like the one in India, where rice is a major crop and QD is an abundantly available industrial waste product. This investigation attempts to use RHA and QD as partial replacements for cement and sand, respectively, in developing self-compacting mortar (SCM) mixes. The replacement percentage of cement by RHA varies in the range of 5-20%. On the basis of earlier results, an optimum percentage level of 40% sand replacement by QD is adopted. The compressive strengths of a control SCM mix (without RHA and QD) and compressive strengths of SCM mixes (with RHA and QD) are obtained experimentally at different ages of curing and are compared to assess the viability of adding RHA and QD in SCM mixes.

Self-healing efficiency of cementitious materials containing tubular capsules filled with healing agent,Mortar; Cracks; Autonomous healing; Polyurethane; X-ray Computed Tomography,CONCRETE; PERMEABILITY; ADHESIVE,"It has been estimated that, in Europe, 50% of the annual construction budget is spent on rehabilitation and repair of the existing structures [1]. Therefore, autonomous crack healing of concrete, a construction material that is highly susceptible to cracking, would be desirable. In this research, an encapsulated healing agent was embedded in the mortar matrix to obtain self-healing properties. Upon crack appearance, the capsules break and the healing agent is released, causing crack repair. By means of Computed Tomography and visual observation of the crack faces, filling of the cracks with healing agent was observed. It was seen that more than 50% of the original strength and stiffness could be regained after self-healing. It was also found that the water permeability could be reduced by a factor 10(2) to 10(4) due to autonomous crack healing. As a consequence, the proposed technique may be used for partial restoration of concrete properties after cracking. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011
Optimization of the formulation of micro-polymer concretes,Micro-polymer concrete; Mechanical characteristics; Porosity; Formulations; Microstructure; Epoxy,BEHAVIOR,"This research investigates the optimization of micro-polymer concretes (MPC) formulations in order to produce a construction material that has excellent physical and mechanical properties, such as minimum void content, high Young's modulus and excellent strength properties. An epoxy resin reinforced with a graded mixture of coarse and fine sands is used as a binder to design the micro-polymer concretes. Effects of curing time and binder contents were evaluated through ultrasonic wave propagation method and flexural, compressive, direct and tensile tests, performed at room temperature. The porosity of different MPC formulations as well as the distribution of the voids size is investigated as a function of curing time using mercury intrusion porosimeter (MIP). Results show that with increasing the binder content, the total pore volume and the maximum pore size are reduced significantly. The kinetics and the mechanisms of diffusion of water in MPC depend strongly on the mass fraction of resin. All the mechanical properties of MPC stabilize after 3 days curing at ambient temperatures. The micro-polymer concrete designed with a polymer content of 9% shows the highest physical and mechanical characteristics such as strengths, rigidity, the lower voids content and thus the best durability. The experimental results reveal that the mechanical behavior of MPC is time dependent. Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) was applied to observe the microstructure and the porosity and to understand the failure mechanism of MPC. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011
Concrete with recycled concrete aggregate and crushed clay bricks,Recycled concrete aggregate; Crushed clay bricks; Mechanical properties; Permeability,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; STRENGTH; COARSE,"In the last two decades, a variety of recycling methods for construction and demolition wastes (CDW) have been developed. For instance, as one of the major components in CDW, concrete rubble has been used to replace natural aggregate after being treated. This is known as recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The property and use of RCA for structural or non-structural concrete have been extensively studied and numerous findings have been adopted in engineering practice to produce sustainable concrete. Concrete rubble, however, is inevitably mixed with other wastes such as crushed clay bricks (CCB). The level of inclusion varies depending on the original construction materials of demolished buildings. The differing properties of CCB from RCA will affect the mix design as well as the physical and mechanical properties of the resulting new concrete when the inclusion level exceeds a certain limit. Separating CCB from RCA presents an operational difficulty in practice and also has huge cost implications. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of CCB with various inclusion levels on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. This paper reports on a study conducted to investigate the physical and mechanical properties of recycled concrete with high inclusion levels of RCA and CCB and to explore the potential or the limitation of this type of mixed recycled aggregate in primary concrete structures.

Mechanical properties of kenaf fiber reinforced concrete,Sustainable construction; Toughness; Scanning electron microscopy; Compressive strength; Compressive modulus; Splitting tension strength; Flexural behavior,,"This paper presents the findings of an experimental research program that was conducted to study the mechanical properties of a natural fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) which is made using the bast fibers of the kenaf plant. The kenaf plant is quickly developing as a replacement crop for the dwindling tobacco industry in the south-eastern United States. Appropriate mixture proportions and mixing procedures are recommended to produce kenaf FRC (KFRC) with fiber volume contents of 1.2% and 2.4%. The compressive strength, compressive modulus, splitting tensile strength and modulus of rupture of KFRC specimens are presented and compared to the properties of plain concrete control specimens. The experimental results indicate that the mechanical properties of KFRC are comparable to those of plain concrete control specimens, particularly when accounting for the effect of the increased w/c ratio required to produce workable KFRC. Further, the results indicate that KFRC generally exhibits more distributed cracking and higher toughness than plain concrete. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM's) indicate that a good bond between the kenaf fibers and the surrounding matrix is achieved. The SEM's also provide interesting information regarding the mechanisms which contribute to the failure and post-peak behavior of the KFRC which may be beneficial to future modeling efforts. The research findings indicate that KFRC is a promising 'green' construction material which could potentially be used in a number of different structural applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking into Account Grain Growth during the Finite-Element Modeling of the Superplastic Formation of Promising Construction Materials,superplasticity; deformation hardening; modeling; edge problem; ANSYS,NANOSTRUCTURED MATERIALS; ALUMINUM-ALLOY; PREDICTION,"A way to take into account the influence of grain growth in the statement of the edge problem for the mechanics of a deformed solid as applied to the superplastic formation of microcrystalline and ultra-fine-grain materials is suggested. The concrete example of a numerical solution for the edge problem of creep theory in a medium of the ANSYS software complex according to the published experimental data is suggested. A satisfactory agreement between the results of the solution to the edge problem and the experimental data is obtained. This solution is analyzed, and certain features of the character of the stress-strained state in the deformation site are revealed. In particular, it is established that complex disproportionate loading occurs in the vicinity of the fastening contour. Under this loading, the stress trajectories in the Il'yushin space have a larger curvature, despite the fact that the curvature of the corresponding deformation trajectories in the deformation space is relatively small.",2011
Cement and concrete flow analysis in a rapidly expanding economy: Ireland as a case study,Material flow analysis; Ireland; Concrete; Cement; Resources use; Waste management,NORWAY DWELLING STOCK; CONSTRUCTION,"A national material flow model for concrete, the most popular construction material in Ireland, was developed based on the framework of material flow analysis. Using this model the Irish concrete cycle for the year 2007 was constructed by analysing the material life cycle of concrete which consists of the three phases of: production (including extraction of raw materials and manufacture of cement), usage (ready-mix and other products) and waste management (disposal or recovery). In this year, approximately 35 million metric tonnes of raw materials were consumed to produce 5 million metric tonnes of cement and 33 million metric tonnes of concrete. Concrete production was approximately 8 metric tonnes per capita. By comparison, the concrete waste produced in that year was minimal at only 0.3 million metric tonnes. Irish building stock is young and there was little demolition of structures in the year of study. However this build up of construction stock will have implications for the future waste Bows when the majority of stock built in the last decade (43% of residential stock was constructed in the last 15 years) reaches its end of life.

An Assessment of the Energy and Resource-efficient Hybrid Composite Beams for Multi-residential Apartments,Composite beam; Energy consumption; Materials; Frame structure; Multi-residential apartment; Pre-cast offsite building,STEEL,"Apartments with load-bearing wall construction are used extensively in Korea, but have the disadvantage of a short life, causing serious economic losses in terms of construction waste, materials and energy consumption. This paper presents the findings on multi-residential apartments that utilise a hybrid composite frame as a viable alternative for the energy efficiency associated with construction materials. The hybrid composite frame consists of a structural tee, reinforcement steels and pre-cast concrete. The use of the hybrid composite frame reduces the overall amount of energy consumption. In addition, multi-residential apartments utilising a hybrid composite frame have advantages such as flexibility in planning and easier repair and remodelling. This study investigates tower-shape, multi-residential apartments of various heights and floor areas to compare the energy efficiency of the hybrid composite system with that of the bearing wall system. The multi-residential apartments that utilise the hybrid composite frame are analysed in terms of both reduced principal materials and reduced energy consumption compared with apartments of a load-bearing wall structure. Rapid demand for long life and multi-residential apartment construction is expected.",2011
Experimental study on thermal behavior of a building structure using rubberized exterior-walls,Scrap-tire; Waste-recovery; Thermal insulation; Energy efficient building; Time-lag,DECREMENT FACTOR; TIME-LAG; THERMOPHYSICAL PROPERTIES; CONCRETE; PERFORMANCES; BRICKS,"Addition of scrap-tire pieces into cementitious composites improves their thermal insulation performance. Development of such construction materials with lower thermal transmittance reusing these wastes is a challenging issue since it provides a combined solution for today's energy saving and environmental pollution concerns. In favor of this, recent European Union directives have brought quiet strict limits to reduce energy consumption and landfill disposal of solid wastes. A model room whose exteriors are fully made with scrap-tire added concrete is built here to increase its thermal protection. A standard/conventional room at identical dimensions but surrounded by ordinary concretes is also built to examine influence of scrap tire addition on room's thermal protection. Long-term thermal behaviors of these two rooms are investigated and compared under real atmospheric environments. Their indoor temperatures reveal that addition of scrap tire pieces lowers both indoor temperature variations and the effect of outdoor conditions. As an example, mean values of yearly thermal time lag are found to be 3.28 and 2.96h, respectively for the rooms built with and without using scrap tire pieces, corresponding to nearly 11% improvement in thermal protection. Results in overall verify that scrap tire addition improves thermal protection of the room and it is a cost effective solution for people with low income and/or individuals living in rural areas.

Analysis of the strain transfer in a new FBG sensor for Structural Health Monitoring,Fiber Bragg grating sensors; Fiber optic sensors; Strain transfer; Structural Health Monitoring,BRAGG GRATING SENSORS; FIBER; CONCRETE; BRIDGES,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) is a topic of great interest in structural engineering due to the ageing of the built infrastructures and the growing use of innovative structural systems and construction materials. Although several sensing technologies have been developed for use in SHM systems, fiber optic sensors, especially Fiber Bragg grating sensors (FBGs), are now attracting much attention due to their advantages over other types of sensors. This paper presents a new FBG strain sensor with an unsymmetrical packaging configuration designed to be fixed to the surface of the monitored structure. A 3D Finite Element numerical analysis of the sensor, packaging and adhesive used to fix the system to the host structure was conducted to study the influence of (1) the thickness and mechanical properties of the adhesive, and (2) the configuration of the packaging on the accuracy of the sensor. The results obtained from the numerical models show that the strains measured by the proposed system and the actual strains in the host structure differ by less than 2.5% due to the fact that the packaging contains only one layer of composite material in an unsymmetrical configuration. The proposed design can thus be said to be an improvement compared to the typical configurations of optical fiber surface strain sensors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011
Construction materials as a waste management solution for cellulose sludge,,PULP; CONCRETE,"Sustainable waste management system for effluents treatment sludge has been a pressing issue for pulp and paper sector. Recycling is always recommended in terms of environmental sustainability. Following an approach of waste valorisation, this work aims to demonstrate the technical viability of producing fiber-cement roof sheets incorporating cellulose primary sludge generated on paper and pulp mills. From the results obtained with preliminary studies it was possible to verify the possibility of producing fiber-cement sheets by replacing 25% of the conventional used virgin long fiber by primary effluent treatment cellulose sludge. This amount of incorporation was tested on an industrial scale. Environmental parameters related to water and waste, as well as tests for checking the quality of the final product was performed. These control parameters involved total solids in suspension, dissolved salts, chlorides, sulphates, COD, metals content. In the product, parameters like moisture, density and strength were controlled. The results showed that it is possible to replace the virgin long fibers pulp by primary sludge without impacts in final product characteristics and on the environment. This work ensures the elimination of significant waste amounts, which are nowadays sent to landfill, as well as reduces costs associated with the standard raw materials use in the fiber-cement industrial sector.

Corrosion assessment and restoration strategies of reinforced concrete buildings of the cultural heritage,,CARBONATED CONCRETE,"Since the beginning of the 20th century, in Italy as in many other countries, reinforced concrete (RC) became one of the most popular construction materials and it was used for buildings, monuments, infrastructures, etc. Several of these structures, although of recent formation, have now been included in the cultural heritage, because of their architectural or social relevance. As a consequence of the typical urban or rural exposure conditions of these buildings, they often suffer damage due to carbonation-induced corrosion of reinforcement, such as concrete spalling or cracking or rust stains that may affect the serviceability of structures. Furthermore, chloride-induced corrosion of reinforcement, may also concern buildings exposed to de-icing salts or marine environments. Due to strict requirements related to the preservation of the original materials and texture, the repair of structures that belong to the cultural heritage cannot rely on the conventional repair technique, based on the replacement of carbonated concrete. Therefore, the conservation of RC buildings of the cultural heritage is a challenge, since it requires the development of specific strategies aimed at finding the best compromise between, on one hand, the restoration of structural safety and the prevention of future damage and, on the other hand, the preservation of the original materials and surfaces. This paper analyses the results of inspections carried out on several buildings, built in Italy throughout the 20th century in different micro- and macro-climates, with the aim of showing their peculiarities with regard to steel corrosion and the selection of restorations strategies.",2011
Plate-strengthened deep reinforced concrete coupling beams,composite structures; concrete structures; seismic engineering,BEHAVIOR,"Many old reinforced concrete buildings in developed countries need to be strengthened due to the aging of construction materials, changes in functional use or new design loading requirements. In the present study, a series of experiments were conducted attempting to retrofit deep reinforced concrete coupling beams using a bolted steel plate. In addition to the control specimen, the other specimens were bolted with a steel plate on the side face to improve the shear strength and inelastic behaviour. A mechanical device was added to two specimens to restrain plate buckling. The study revealed that adding an external plate is an effective way to improve the shear capacity, energy dissipation and rotation deformability of deep reinforced concrete coupling beams. Moreover, the plate buckling-restrained specimen with a sufficient number of bolts in the anchor regions had a more stable response and better inelastic performance under reversed cyclic loads. These findings can help designers to a better understanding of this type of composite coupling beam.",2011

However there will remain some important sources of pollution such as ash and breeze deposits, which have a negative impact upon the microclimate and upon all the environmental factors. The object of this paper is to establish a technology to permit the integral salvage of the ashes and breezes resulted from the energetic coal burning, reducing and eliminating the necessity of using ash and breeze ponds, which actually reach 250 ha and can store up to 30 million tones of waste. The technology for the salvage of this industrial waste, with high content of heavy, precious and radioactive metals, contains: physic procedures: separation in magnetic and gravitational field: in order to obtain some concentrates industrially useful and a sterile that can be used in the construction materials industry. The similitude between the chemical, mineralogical and hydraulic properties of the ashes and those of the classical construction materials, make it possible to use the ""cheaper material"" especially to make thermo and phonoizolated products but also some construction materials BCfA (cellular concrete without autoclaving) with superior characteristics.

Dynamic Monitoring Systems for Structures under Extreme Loads,Structural Health Monitoring; Dynamic Monitoring; Instrumentation; Sensors; Extreme Load Monitoring,,"The dynamic monitoring of civil structures such as buildings and bridges is traditionally approached using acceleration and velocity sensors. When a monitoring program is designed to address concerns related to the level of strain in certain members, fatigue or displacements due to extreme loads, it is sometimes advantageous to measure those parameters directly, instead of deriving them from acceleration or velocity data. Inhomogeneous construction materials such as concrete, stone or masonry require the use of long-gauge sensors to measure strain, since local sensors can provide erroneous data due to local material changes. On the other hand, acceleration and tilt sensors are very useful to capture the global deformations and displacements. The development of long-gauge-length fiber optic sensors can be considered as a useful addition to the toolkit of those interested in the structural dynamics. The system can monitor structures over long periods of time at acquisition frequencies up to 10 kHz and with sub-microstrain resolution. The possibility of obtaining static and dynamic measurements from the same sensor is another advantage of this technology. For acceleration and tilt monitoring, MEMS sensors are now recognized as a powerful and low-cost alternative to more traditional sensor types. Fully-integrated sensors with 3-axis accelerometers and two-axis tiltmeters are now available in a compact packaging that also contain all data acquisition electronics and can be easily deployed in new or existing structures, connecting them directly to an Ethernet network. This contribution briefly introduces fiber optic and MEMS sensing technologies and will than illustrate their application to structural health monitoring through several examples, including the new I35W bridge in Minneapolis USA, the Ile d'Orleans suspension Bridge in Quebec Canada and the shaking-table test of a full-scale masonry building reinforced with composite materials.",2011

Design Consideration of the Nonuniform Stress Distribution of Pultruded Structural Member under Compression,Buckling and post-buckling; Compression member; Pultruded structural shape; Form factor; Design; Buckling Experiment,,"As a new construction material, fiber reinforced polymeric plastic structural shapes are readily available. Therefore, new construction and existing structure rehabilitation using FRP materials are ever increasing trend because of FRP material's chemical and mechanical properties compared with those of conventional construction materials such as steel and concrete. Among the structural composites, pultruded fiber reinforced polymeric plastic structural members are the most popular for the civil engineering applications because of the cost effectiveness. However, they are made of fiber reinforced polymer resin system, they have relatively low modulus of elasticity and also cross-sections of structural shapes are composed of thin plate components such as flange and web. Therefore, structural stability is an important issue in the design of pultruded structural members. For the design of pultruded structural member under compression, buckling and post-buckling strengths of plate components may be taken into account. In the structural steel design following AISC/LRFD, in addition to the buckling strength, the nonuniform stress distribution in the section is incorporated with a form factor. In this paper, the form factor for the design of pultruded structural member under compression is investigated by experiment. Based on the experimental results, the form factor for the design of pultruded structural shapes have been suggested.",2011

Embodied energy analysis of multi-storied residential buildings in urban India,urban buildings; embodied energy; construction materials,,"Today developing nations are witnessing an unprecedented pace of urbanization in the wake of industrialization and globalization. This is giving rise to an ever increasing demand for housing and infrastructure to support the growing population and its activities. Energy is the single-most significant driver of this urban development and buildings stand as the most visible expressions of this development. However, buildings are known to be highly energy intensive and considering energy supply from conventional sources, these buildings have substantial negative environmental impacts. While operational energy of buildings have been mapped and assessed for different building typologies and various climatic zones, the embodied energy captive in the building fabric has received relatively lesser attention. Thus, efforts towards energy management and conservation in building operations have sufficiently addressed the concerns and have been reflected in the many building-rating systems prevailing across the world, though there had been limited research in the field of embodied energy measurement of contemporary multi-storied residential buildings constructed with modern technology. This assumes more significance in view of today's energy constrained world where exhaustive database on energy expended through all possible avenues need to be recorded in order to optimize and regulate this capital energy component of the building industry.

Based on the analysis of existing research achievement, for the aim of improving the calculation accuracy of creep effects in bridge structures, several main problems that should be paid attention to in concrete creep analysis are pointed out from four aspects: (1) in design stage, the reasonable creep prediction model should be selected in accord with the local building materials and environment conditions; (2) during the analysis of creep effects, the initial stresses state and the stresses redistribution should be attended; (3) the reliability of prestress loss calculation should be considered in analysis of concrete creep effects; (4) the differences between normal construction materials and that of new types should be taken into account in concrete creep analysis.",2011
Study of the Durability Characteristics of Hydraulic Concrete,hydraulic concrete; durability; freeze thaw cycle; concrete crack,ABRASION RESISTANCE; WEAR,"Hydraulic concrete is a versatile and most popular construction material. Its long-term performance depends on the interactions with the service condition, in which the penetration of deleterious substances is highly significant.

Digital Imagine Correlation (DIC) Method for Detecting Crack Development in Construction Materials Subject to loading,Imagine process; Non-Homogeneous material; displacement field; Strain distribution,DISPLACEMENT,"The digital image correlation (DIC) technique is developed for identifying the crack development in brick wall and reinforced concrete beam. This method is tested on brick wall and reinforce concrete beam to evaluate the observation with various strain quantities and mesh sizes. The analysis results reveal that using the von Mises strain field will lead to fine precision of crack observation, and that clearer imagines can be obtained with smaller mesh sizes. This technique is capable of judging crack loading to predict crack occurrences.",2011
Building Construction in North Cyprus: Problems and Alternatives Solutions,Building Construction; Maintenance; Repair; Steel Framed; Reinforced Concrete Framed,,"In recent years the number of medium rise buildings is slowly increasing in North Cyprus. As a result, the need to use new construction materials and technologies is becoming more essential. Using hot rolled steel and cold rolled galvanized light gauge steel for building frames are two of the possible alternatives to reinforced concrete building frames currently used in the market. The number of steel framed buildings so far is less than five percent of all the buildings. Steel is an imported material. It is mainly used for the industrial buildings, either as truss roof system and/or complete portal frame and/or truss roof steel framed single storey structures. The engineers are not knowledgeable enough, the lack of training, inadequate fabrication facilities and many years of having used to reinforced concrete framed structures are the main reasons for engineers not using enough steel framed structures. The first part of this paper investigates the problems and possible solution of steel usage for structures in North Cyprus by analysing the number of buildings constructed after the year 2000. The second part summarizes the problems relating to the local reinforced concrete framed building construction, including inadequacies of repair, quality control, material quality and isolation of buildings from the external effects. Sustainability, stability and repair aspects for steel structures in comparison to reinforced concrete structures in North Cyprus are also briefly discussed in this paper.",2011
Development of a Smart RFID-Based Corrosion Sensor,,REINFORCEMENTS,"The development and test of a smart RFID-based corrosion sensor is presented. The sensor has a small size (5 cm x 3 cm x 1.8 cm) allowing it to be embedded in concrete or other construction materials. The corrosion sensor is built around a low-power microcontroller which enables multiple and complex measurements to take place. The sensor is totally passive and it does not require batteries. Its power supply is derived from an electromagnetic field transmitted by an external RFID reader. This field is also used for data communication. The sensor contains a potentiostat that is used to perform linear polarization measurements on a corrosion cell. The sensor can also measure temperature and its own supply voltage. Unlike existing embeddable corrosion sensors, the developed sensor can acquire full polarization curves with a resolution of 10 bits. The sensor can communicate with ISO-15693 compliant RFID readers.",2011
Utilization of recycled post consumer carpet waste fibers as reinforcement in lightweight cementitious composites,Construction materials; Reinforcement; Composite materials; Textile fibres; Recycling,,"Purpose - A large amount of post-consumer carpet waste is discarded into landfills. The need to recycle this waste is increasing due to the lack of available landfill spaces in many parts of the world, environmental concerns, and resource conservation. The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of this waste for a low-cost, high-volume application. Design/methodology/approach - Fibers from carpet waste have been successfully used as reinforcement in concrete, typically at 0.1-1 per cent volume fraction (fractions by weight are even lower), for enhanced toughness. In this study, lightweight cementitious composites were fabricated that were reinforced with recycled carpet fibers at up to 20 per cent fiber to cement weight ratios. Flexural, toughness, and impact properties of the lightweight cementitious composites were characterized. Findings - The density of the composites decreases with the increase of fiber content. In the three-point bending test, lightweight cementitious composites exhibited a ductile behavior, and the flexural strength increases with the density of the composites. The energy absorption measured by the drop weight impact test was not very sensitive to the material parameters due to the total absorption of the impact energy by the specimens. Originality/value - The density of the lightweight composites ranges from 0.7 to 1.0g/cm(3), which was about 30-40 per cent of the density of typical concrete. Besides being moisture and termite resistant, the lightweight composites were very tough and could be cut and fastened with ordinary tools and nails. The lightweight composites are suitable for applications such as underlayment and wall panels for buildings, as well as for outdoor structures.",2011
Experimental Research on Seismic Behavior of Low-carbon Construction Materials RAC Frame Columns,Recycled Aggregate Concrete; Frame Column; Recycled Coarse Aggregate Replacement Rate; Hysteretic Loop; Consumption Characteristic,,"A comparative study is conducted on the seismic behaviors of three recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) frame columns under low cyclic load. The recycled aggregate replacement rate is 0%, 50%, 100% respectively. The mechanical characteristics, failure mode, hysteresis loops, ductility and consumption characteristics of frame columns with different recycled aggregate replacement rate and same axial compression ratio are analyzed in this paper comparatively. The rule characteristics between ordinary concrete and recycled aggregate concrete frame columns are found. The result indicates that failure process of recycled aggregate concrete frame columns is similar to that of ordinary concrete. The seismic behaviors of recycled aggregate concrete frame columns, including the ductility etc., still meet the related requirements of earthquake-resistance designing. So it is concluded in this paper that the recycled aggregate concrete can be applied in concrete structures. Because of its properties are certain deficiencies, some tectonic measures must be enhanced.",2011
Impedance based Non-Destructive Evaluation of the FRP Adhesive Joints in Corrosive Environment with Re-usable Technique,EMI; adhesive bond joint; NDE; health monitoring; environmental effect; reusable sensor,STRUCTURAL HEALTH; DAMAGE DETECTION; CONCRETE; TRANSDUCERS; HYDRATION; SENSORS,"In this study, a Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) method is introduced for evaluating the effects of FRP adhesive joint bond strength subjected to various environmental conditions using electromechanical impedance (EMI) method. The applicability of Fibre Reinforced Plastics (FRP) as a construction material is being globally recognized for their high stiffness and strength to weight ratio and this method proposes a possibility of detecting any strength loss to the adhesive bond without damaging the structure, such as FRP joint itself. PZT (Lead-Zirconate-Titanate) patches were utilized to detect any changes to the bond strength of the FRP adhesive joint exposed to different kinds of environmental conditions by measuring the electrical admittance of the PZT sensors. In addition, a re-usable technique has been introduced with a utilization of magnet to allow multiple sensing of specimens with a single sensor. The results show a possibility of detecting decrease in the bond strength of FRP adhesive using the EMI method.",2011
Characterization of Mechanically Stabilized Layer by Resilient Modulus and Permanent Deformation Testing,,,"The majority of roadways in the United States are low volume. Pavement structures for low-volume roads (LVRs) are designed according to empirical procedures that are sometimes verified by a mechanistic-based design process. The flexible pavement structure for an LVR consists of a relatively thin asphalt concrete wearing course and an aggregate base course constructed on subgrade. An asphalt wearing course provides a good riding surface and moisture protection for the base course. Service life of a thin asphalt pavement depends on material quality and thickness of granular layers. A compelling need now exists for reducing the cost of building and maintaining the national transportation infrastructure. The limited lifespan of most construction materials due to continuing wear and tear requires more creative, innovative, economical, and sustainable roadway design techniques. Geogrid reinforcements in LVRs are seen as a particularly promising solution because they can be designed to provide an equivalent service life through use of less material. The combination of the aggregate and geogrid materials creates an improved or mechanically stabilized layer (MSL) with a significantly increased resilient modulus. The objective of this study was to use existing testing protocol to determine and to evaluate material design parameters for an unbound and a geogrid MSL. To determine the effects of an MSL, a test combination that included AASHTO T307 and NCHRP 598 was conducted on both unbound and mechanically stabilized aggregate specimens.",2011

Reuse of Municipal Wastewater Sludge for Construction Material,Municipal Wastewater Sludge; Reuse; Construction materials; Portland cement,ASH; AGGREGATE,"Treatment of municipal wastewater results worldwide in the production of large amounts of sewage sludge. The major part of the dry matter content of this sludge consists of nontoxic organic compounds, in general a combination of primary sludge and secondary (microbiological) sludge. The sludge also contains a substantial amount of inorganic material and a small amount of toxic components. The large volume of wastewater sludge generated requires enormous landfill space for disposal. Diverting the wastewater sludge from landfill would alleviate the shortage of landfill sites. Thus alternative applications have to be considered for the wastewater sludge diverted away from the landfills. The use of wastewater sludge for the production of construction materials is reviewed in this paper. Wastewater sludge can be used as raw materials for making bricks, concrete filler and concrete aggregates. The study reveals that the reuse of wastewater sludge as construction materials offers a technically feasible alternative for sludge disposal.",2011
The Influence of Different Urban Pavements on Water Chemistry,Pavement; Construction Materials; Urbanization; Water Quality,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; IMPERVIOUS SURFACE; BIODEGRADATION,"Urban pavements may influence water quality by leaching contaminants such as total hydrocarbons, nutrients and metals which can negatively influence receiving waters. We studied the influence of different pavement types on water chemistry using recirculating laboratory mesocosms. Pavement types tested were unsealed and sealed asphalt concrete pavement, recycled asphalt concrete pavement, Portland cement concrete (PCC), PCC with fly ash, PCC with ground-granulated blast furnace slag, and porous PCC. Pavement types variably influenced pH, metal, bromide, chloride, phosphate and sulfate concentrations relative to controls. Data suggest pavement types can act as a source of contaminants to receiving waters, not just a conduit.",2011
"Non-traditional (""geopolymer"") cements and concretes for construction of large CCS equipment",Geopolymers; metakaolin; fly ash; blast furnace slag; durability; carbon capture and storage; leaching; compressive strength; porosity,,"Geopolymer concrete is being proposed as a potential construction material in carbon capture and storage facilities, in particular the harsh chemical environments found in post-combustion capture solvent columns. Geopolymer concrete is synthesised by reacting industrial wastes (coal fly ash and/or metallurgical slags), with an alkali source to form the binder, blended with aggregates (sand and rocks). In addition to environmental benefits, and utilisation of currently-landfilled fly ashes (landfilled at the rate of several million tonnes p.a. in Australia alone, and hundreds of millions of tonnes p.a. worldwide), geopolymer concrete can provide some significant performance advantages over existing technologies. In particular, the chemical resistance of the geopolymer binder has been highlighted in laboratory testing over a number of years [1]. This paper examines a series of metakaolin, fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag binders. Durability studies, which include leaching and strength retained on exposure to solvents (monoethanolamine, potassium carbonate and distilled water), show high resistance to ethanolamine. Potassium carbonate resistance depends greatly on the formulation used. Porosity is a key factor in overall strength and chemical resistance. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2011
Optimization of Casting Process Parameters for Homogeneous Aggregate Distribution in Self-Compacting Concrete: A Feasibility Study,component; Self-Compacting Concrete; Flow simulation; Simulation based optimization; Genetic algorithms,,"The use of self-compacting concrete (SCC) as a construction material has been getting more attention from the industry. Its application area varies from standard structural elements in bridges and skyscrapers to modern architecture having geometrical challenges. However, heterogeneities induced during the casting process may lead to variations of local mechanical properties and hence to a potential decrease in load carrying capacity of the structure. This paper presents a methodology for optimization of SCC casting aiming at having a homogeneous aggregate distribution; a beam has been used as geometric example. The aggregate distribution is predicted by a numerical flow model coupled with a user defined volume fraction subroutine. The process parameters in casting with SCC in general are horizontal and vertical positions, movement, as well as the size of the inlet, and the duration of the filling etc., however since this work is the initial feasibility study in this field, only three process parameters are considered. Despite the reduction in the number of process parameters, the complexity involved in the considered casting process results in a non trivial optimal design set.",2011
Simple Analytical Model for Formwork Design of Self-Consolidating Concrete,formwork; placement; self-consolidating concrete,PRESSURE,"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is a recently developed innovative construction material. No additional compacting is needed because of its high filling ability; consequently, the labor cost of compacting is economical. SCC, however, needs a stronger formwork that can resist the higher lateral pressure of cases that use ordinary concrete. This study uses the proposed two-function model to: 1) characterize the pressure response of a fresh SCC mixture; and 2) evaluate the maximum pressure that develops on the formwork. Various SCC compositions were experimented with to show the validity of the evaluation. The experimental results and analytical interpretation suggest that the maximum lateral pressure allowed in the design of the SCC formwork could be determined from two parameters that depend on the placement rate and the duration of the placement.",2011
Experimental Study on Mechanical Properties of Concrete under Triaxial Compression,triaxial compression; concrete; mechanical properties; experimental study,,"Traxial compressive tests on concrete samples subjected to such stress ratios as 0.1:0.25:1, 0.1:0.5:1, 0.1:0.75: 1 and 0.1:1:1, were performed. Based on mechanical properties measured from the tests, strength and deformation behaviors of concrete under triaxial compression were explored, and then the failure criterion was proposed. The result indicated that the bearing capacity of concrete under triaxial compression is greater than that under uniaxial stress state. Construction material can be greatly reduced considering this factor in design.",2011
Effect of sonication on the reactivity of silica fume in Portland cement mortars,,POZZOLANIC REACTION; ACTIVATION; PASTES,"Currently, the use of silica fume for the production of mortars and high-performance concrete is of great importance to the construction materials sector. Different applications of silica fume have generated extensive studies about its high reactivity as a pozzolanic material, in addition to its effect on the properties of some materials within which it is incorporated. In this study a sonication process was applied by means of which the deagglomeration of the larger particles of densified silica fume (CSF) was achieved. The result is a CSF treated with the ultrasound probe, which is obtained for different tests where the parameters of sonication such as sonication power level and sonication time are varied. This treatment makes it possible to increase the quantity of submicrometric particles in the sample. The effect of sonication process on CSF produces a greater quantity of very fine particles, which improve the pozzolanic reactivity of silica fume and increase the fixation of hydrated lime. This behaviour also produces higher mechanical strength in mortars manufactured with sonicated silica fume (SSF). The mechanical strengths of SSF mortars were greater than those for control and CSF mortar. Different percentages of cement were substituted (between 0 and 15% by weight), and in all cases the SSF mortars showed important differences from the CSF mortar. It was observed that for the longest sonication times and highest sonication power levels, mechanical strengths were increased.",2011
Recycling of Crushed Clay Brick as Aggregate in Concrete,Construction waste material; Concrete; Crushed clay brick; Non-structural concrete products; Recycling,COARSE AGGREGATE,"Clay brick generated from construction project sites is usually delivered to landfills for disposal and thus they can damage environment. The use of crushed clay brick can solve the environmental problem. This paper presents the possible use of crushed clay brick as a construction material. This new material gathered from some construction project sites in Iran is used as 100% aggregate in the production of concrete. The results indicated that the crushed clay brick reduced the unit weight and compressive strength of concrete, and increase the water absorption value. This new concrete can be used in non-structural products.",2011
Alkali Reactivity of Construction Spoil Gravel from Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay Subsea Tunnel,Alkali reactivity; Spoil aggregate; Qingdao subsea tunnel; Swelling rate,CONCRETE,"Nowadays, a huge amount of concrete has been used as main construction material. This as a consequence will consume a large quantity of natural aggregates which quantity is not limitless. On the other hand, for instance, in the tunnel construction, a lot of spoil rocks could be produced. It will be beneficial both from the aspect of economy and ecology if these spoil rocks could be used as concrete aggregates. In this case, the alkali reactivity of the spoil aggregates will have to be determined to avoid the potential reaction between aggregates and cement. In this contribution, the spoil aggregates from Qingdao Jiaozhou Bay Subsea Tunnel have been used to prepared concrete specimens. And their alkali reactivity has been determined by swelling test. The results indicate that the swelling rates of all specimens made by spoil aggregates, both from 6 different places in underground part and from 13 places in subsea part of the Tunnel, are at most 0.08 %, which is not higher than the limit value of 0.1 % according to the standard. This means the tested spoil aggregates do not have potential alkali reactivity, and they can be used as concrete aggregates.",2011

Growth of the construction industry, which draws labor and materials from rural and periurban areas, is a key component of rural-urban interactions. Using a case study from the Perote Valley, Mexico, this article analyzes how urbandriven concrete aggregate mining affects rural agricultural lands and livelihoods. Land-cover changes associated with aggregate surface mining were examined by comparing aerial photographs, satellite images, and Global Positioning System field maps of the valley. In addition, sixty-six formal household interviews were conducted in three agrarian communities. Results indicate that between 1995 and 2006, mine surface area quadrupled, from 181 to 706 hectares, and the spatial distribution of surface mines followed a predictable pattern of extraction, from most to least accessible. Numerous factors persuaded farmers to convert fields to mines, including increased prices for aggregates, consumerist desires for new homes, and declining returns to agriculture. Moreover, farmers believed they could or would recultivate mined land following extraction. Yet, in 2006, among the three agrarian communities, 202 (45 percent) of the 482 hectares of agricultural land extracted were not recultivated. Although deep mines were more likely to be abandoned, findings suggest that land revalorization occurred among farmers, with the scarcity value of nonrenewable aggregates gradually surpassing the land's agricultural value. In the long term, diminished agricultural potential resulting from widespread mine abandonment might drive farmers to migrate to cities for employment, creating a positive feedback between urban demand for construction aggregates and mining of agricultural fields.",2011
Performance of sound insulation of AAC in massive buildings - experience with EN 12354-1,sound insulation; loss factor; EN 12354-1,,"Design and calculation of building sound performance is standardized in EN 12354. The calculation method of this relatively new standard requires a lot of precise input data. Besides the mass per area of a massive component, values like the vibration reduction index and the loss factor are required. As a consequence of the implementation of EN 12354, plenty of research was initiated about the acoustic properties of different construction materials. In collaboration with different research institutes and Universities numerous measurements on AAC structures were performed. The results have become the basis for the integration of the EN 12354 into the German standard DIN 4109. Based on the experience gained in applying the calculation method of EN 12354-1, this paper gives an overview about the acoustic performance of single leaf AAC structures in comparison with other building materials. The sound reduction indices of pure materials as AAC, lightweight concrete or calcium silicate bricks are compared. In a second step, the calculated sound reduction indices are compared with measurement results of real buildings. It could be confirmed, that the determined sound reduction indices in planning of a building are in sufficient agreement with the measured and quantified sound insulation in the real building. It is concluded that there is a good correlation between calculated performance on the basis of the material parameters, and the actual measured sound performance for AAC structures. This proves a high level of certainty in achieving the required sound insulation in design and construction of AAC buildings.",2011
Preliminary Study on Effect of NaOH Concentration on Early Age CoMpressive Strength of Kaolin-Based Green Cement,Kaolin; alkali activated binder; green cement,GEOPOLYMERISATION; ACTIVATION; MIXTURES; MINERALS,"Research works carried out in developing other alkali activated binders such as fly ash and metakaolin show that this new binder based on kaolin is likely to have enormous potential to become an alternative binder to current concrete. Sodium hydroxide was mixed with sodium silicate to prepare liquid alkali activator 24 h prior to use. Kaolin powder was mixed well with alkali activator using mixer. The fresh paste was then rapidly poured into steel mould and put into the oven at suitable temperature. This study aims to analyze the effect of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) concentration (6M-14M) on compressive strength of kaolin cement paste. The result shows that the kaolin binder has adequate compressive strength and is able to apply for non-loading construction materials. This paper outlines the potential of kaolin to produce an environmental friendly, energy saving, clean technology to conserve the natural environment and resources. Kaolin binders are still in the early stages of development and; hence, they need further research work in order to become technically and economically viable construction materials.",2011
Recycling of tailings from Korea Molybdenum Corporation as admixture for high-fluidity concrete,Tailings; Recycling; Admixture; High-fluidity concrete,WASTES,"The main objective of this study is to develop an eco-friendly and a large recycling technique of flotation Tailings from korea (TK) from metal mines as construction materials such as admixtures for high-fluidity concrete (HFC). TK used in this study was obtained from the Korea Molybdenum Corporation in operation. TK was used as the alternative material to adjust flowability and viscosity of HFC in the form of powder agent which enables adjustment of concrete compressive strength. In this study, we have performed concrete rheological tests and concrete flowability tests to obtain the quality characteristics of TK for using as the admixture in producing HFC. The results indicated that the adequate mix ratio of cement to TK should be 8:2 (vol%). It is more effective to use the TK as admixture to control flowability, viscosity and strength of HFC than the normal concrete. It was found that TK could be recycled construction materials in bulk such as admixture for HFC, in terms of the economic and eco-friendly aspects.",2011

Several reasons justify the long experience required to this material in order to be used in Civil Engineering technology. These reasons are both conceptual and technological. The former are related to the use of a diffused reinforcement that could not fully take advantage of the previous experience garnered through reinforced concrete knowledge, because the reinforcement works contradicting the conventional compatibility assumed between concrete matrix and steel reinforcing bars. Its efficiency is based on a large number of parameters and require the introduction of a new composite material, whose mechanical characteristics are mainly based on fracture mechanics. The latter are mainly connected with the problem of reduced workability due to fibre addition in a cement based matrix: the additives evolution allowed the designer to consider a very huge fan of performance possibilities, opening the door to a new profession, the material mix designer, not yet fully exploited, but still in strong evolution. The paper tries to explain both the aforementioned reasons starting from the dream, first drawn by Pier Luigi Nervi with the ""ferrocemento"" introduction, and reaching the border of the actual technology.",2011
GREEN CONCRETE - RECYCLING CONSTRUCTION WASTE,Concrete; recycled waste; mechanical properties; durability,,"Within the European Union, the construction and demolition wastes come to at least 180 million tons per year. Roughly 75% of the waste is disposed to landfill, despite its major recycling potential. The bulk constituents of demolition debris are concrete (50-55%) and masonry (30-40%) with only small percentages of other materials such as metals, glass and timber. In Cyprus, at present, recycling of waste materials is practically inexistent and almost the entire demolition waste products are disposed off in landfill sites. This research paper presents the evaluation and the effective reuse of waste construction materials disposed to landfill sites in Cyprus, due to the lack of a lucid recycling policy and knowledge. The following materials were investigated: (a) recycled concrete aggregates (RCA), as natural aggregate replacements and (b) lime filler from the crushing process of calcareous aggregates used in the production of asphalt concrete, as a partial cement replacement. The study investigates how the waste materials affect workability, as well as mechanical properties and durability indicators. A series of mechanical and durability tests are compared with corresponding values from concrete mixtures being currently utilized in the local construction industry.",2011
FIBER CONCRETE - CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL OF UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES,Steel fibre reinforced concrete; Sprayed concrete lining; Segmental lining; Tunnel lining,,"Concrete is undoubtedly dominating material used for the construction of underground structures. It can be used in three main forms related to its production: Sprayed concrete (shotcrete) used especially for the primary lining of the conventionally excavated structures, but it can be also used for the secondary linings or for single-shell (one pass) linings. Precast concrete used especially either for the segmental lining of the structures excavated by tunnel boring machines (shields) or for overfilled structures. Cast-in-place concrete used especially either for the secondary lining of the conventionally excavated structures or for cut and cover structures. The steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) is more and more frequently used as material for the lining of underground structures. SFRC has been already used for many applications of sprayed concrete (mostly as primary linings) and also for many applications as precast concrete as segmental lining constructed behind circular tunnelling machines. Polypropylene (PP) fibres are often added to the cast-in-place secondary lining to improve their fire resistance; the secondary linings are either from reinforced concrete or from plain concrete (cast-in-place SFRC is not used for this type of lining). There were two major applications of fibre reinforced concrete for underground structures in the Czech Republic. The SFRC was used for sprayed concrete plugs on the underground gas storage Pribram - Haje. The reinforced concrete with PP fibres was used for the secondary lining of the Klimkovice tunnel near Ostrava at the motorway D47. It is possible to expect further applications of fibre reinforced concrete in the Czech Republic. One option - use of SFRC for precast segmental lining - is currently evaluated.",2011
STRAIN MEASUREMENTS IN PRECAST CONCRETE SEGMENTS OF A SHIELD-DRIVEN TUNNEL,Tunnel; Strain monitoring; Precast concrete segments,,"Although the Liefkenshoek Rail Link in the Port of Antwerp consists of a new double track railway section of 16 km length, the principal part is the undertunnelling of the River Scheldt and the Port Canal. In order to construct this undercrossing, two single-track tunnels with an individual length of 6,100 m are being built using the mixshield method. At specified cross-sections of the tunnel lining each segment is equipped with strain gauges attached to the reinforcement bars and inner concrete surface. Some critical sections are to be considered, such as the one located below the Port Canal, taking into account the extremely shallow ground cover of merely 1.1 m. The obtained measurement data will allow assessing the real-time behaviour of the concrete segments under numerous loading conditions during construction of the tunnel lining. Results will show that despite the rough conditions on site, strain monitoring proves an important aid to evaluate both the applied construction materials and the theoretical models for tunnel design.",2011

LOAD-CARRYING BEHAVIOR OF SANDWICH PANELS AT ULTIMATE LIMITE STATE,TRC; Textile Reinforced Concrete; sandwich panel; connector; shear grid; foam,,"Textile reinforced concrete (TRC) is a new construction material that offers several advantages compared to steel reinforced concrete. These advantages dominate in those fields of application where thin-walled, structural elements with a high load-carrying capacity are required. For example, sandwich panels, made of two thin Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC) facings and a core of polymeric rigid foam present an attractive choice for modern building envelopes. These combine low weight with a high structural capacity and simultaneously fulfill the structural-physical demands. Furthermore, these elements enable the realization of superior surface qualities.

PROBABILISTIC AND OPTIMIZED DESIGN OF CONCRETE STRUCTURES,Fully probabilistic design; Partial reliability factor; Concrete structure design; Environmental assessment; Optimization; Monte Carlo Method,,"Some standards for the design of concrete structures (e.g. EC2 and the original eSN 73 1201-86) allow a structure to be designed via several methods. This paper documents the fact that even if a structure does not comply with the partial reliability factor method, according to EC2, it can satisfy the conditions required for the application of the fully probabilistic approach when using the same standard. A design example is presented: a prestressed spun concrete pole. The Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) modification of the Monte Carlo method has been used for the reliability calculation. Efficient design procedures can achieve not only cost savings during construction (materials and energy), erection, servicing, maintenance, disassembly and material recycling but also a more favourable environmental impact.",2011
SUSTAINABILITY OF RC STRUCTURES,Concrete; CO2 uptake; Sustainability; Accelerated Carbonation; Experimental determinations; pH test,,"Although concrete, in form of plain -, reinforced -, or prestressed concrete, is the leading construction material, it is considered non ecologic due to the great amount of CO2 emissions arrising mainly from the manufacturing of cement. On the other hand concrete has the ability to sequestrate carbon dioxide from the atmosphere due to the effect of carbonation. The aim of the authors is to quantify the amount of CO2 absorbed by concrete elements, in order to enhance the carbon footprint, implicitly the sustainability of RC structures. The paper includes a short overview of existing researches regarding CO2 uptake and an experimental method to determine the quantity of absorbed CO2. After 30 days of accelerated carbonation, an original procedure was used to determine how much CO2 was absorbed by the concrete samples: drying and weighting of the samples before and after carbonation. Intermediate results are presented and compared with other theoretical and experimental values.",2011

Engineering Proyect (Case Study) to Obtain Polymer Concrete through Recycled PET,Polyethylene terephthalate; polymer concrete; thermoplastic; commercial thermoplastics; engineering thermoplastics,,"We must continue to environmental awareness at all levels of education and even more on graduate students, thus engaging them in real trouble but looking for alternative solutions, this is a case study of a graduate student in materials engineering, in which the project was to develop a new composite material from recycled PET. It is necessary to generate activities recyclable solid waste processing, thereby decreasing the density of garbage and recyclable materials are harvested. The accumulation of solid waste is an environmental problem that, without recycling, reusing or reducing its potential value is wasted. The time taken for the decomposition of waste is variable depending on the type of material to be extremely slow in the case of plastics. Polyethylene terephthalate bottles (PET) take longer than 50 years to decompose and last longer if they are buried. This research work aims to take advantage of recyclable solid waste to generate new composite materials that help to minimize environmental contamination and allowing for sustainable development by giving economic value to waste. New materials to consider in this paper as the main application area of construction, is aimed at generating alternative construction materials comprising a mixture of recyclable material such as PET, to generate alternative building materials that improve the properties mechanical properties of traditional building materials. It also established a methodology feasible technique for the development of a new composite material to called ""polymer concrete with recycled PET"".",2011
Photocatalytic construction materials: An overview of recent developments and their application to permeable concrete,,BUILDING-MATERIALS; PERVIOUS CONCRETE; WATER; TIO2; DEGRADATION; ADSORPTION; RUNOFF,"Impermeable urban features such as roads, footpaths and car parks all act as significant catchments for run-off water. These waters contain heavy metals and hydrocarbons that can leach into soils and ground water and/or are flushed out to the sea. Research has shown that concrete pavements containing titanium dioxide (TiO2) have the ability to remove certain volatile organic compounds from water and air and help reduce pollution in urban areas. This paper reviews the major developments of photocatalysts such as TiO2 in recent years and their incorporation into construction materials to aid in the degradation of pollutants. It provides an overview of the photo induced redox reaction and super-hydrophilic conversion of TiO2 for the degredation of organic pollutants. The fundamental research and applications of TiO2 in the field of construction and building materials will be reviewed and discussed. The paper also introduces a new concept of incorporating TiO2 into permeable concrete for the degradation of pollution.",2011
INVESTIGATION OF STRUCTURAL BEHAVIORS OF GFRP REINFORCED BRIDGE DECK UNDER DYNAMIC TRAFFIC LOADS,nonlinear finite element analysis; GFRP; compressive membrane action; bridge decks; traffic loads,,"As crucial structural components in bridge structures, bridge deck slabs played an important role in integral structural behaviours and transportation. However, with the increasing of ages in services, the durability of reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs was influenced significantly by carbonation and corrosion. Due to the high corrosion-resistance ability in Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (GFRP), this reinforcement type is developing to be promising alternative reinforcement construction materials for concrete bridge decks currently. In the investigation of structural behaviours of concrete bridge deck slabs reinforced with Glass Fiber-Polymer Bars (GFRP Bars) under transportation loads, nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) on this structural type were carried out with consideration of compressive membrane action (CMA). In the study of existing GFRP reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs, current design standard and numerical results, it was found that the real required reinforcement percentage was lower than that predicted by design methods. Based on the good correlation between NLFEA and experimental tests, the serviceability of a GFRP reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs with consideration of CMA was investigated. The good structural behaviours were observed in the analysis of these non-metallic bridges under dynamic transportation loads.",2011

The Corrosion Resistance Properties and Precipitate of Common Artificial Reef Materials,Artificial Reef; Anodic Polarization Curves; Corrosion Rate; Precipitations,CONCRETE,"the corrosion properties of several common artificial reef materials were studied using electrochemical methods and by measuring corrosion rates in estuary water and seawater. Experimental results show that the 6063 aluminum alloy can be a reef construction material only in low velocity estuary water. Copper in seawater has high corrosion potential and can be passivated, but the high velocity water will destroy the passivation film and decrease the corrosion resistance of copper. Copper is a suitable reef material in low flow seawater and estuary water. With low open potential, high anode current and extensive corrosion, Q235 steel is only suggested as artificial reef material if applying sacrificial anode protection. Pine block and granite are natural materials whose degradation products won't harm the environment, but the pine block has short service life while granite has a minimal corrosion rate. PVC has small corrosion rate but leaches toxic substances after degradation, so it is not suitable for wide-ranging use.",2011
Long-gauge Dynamic Strain monitoring systems for bridges,Long gage fiber optic sensors; Bridge dynamic monitoring; Structural health monitoring,,"The dynamic monitoring of civil structures and bridges in particular is traditionally approached using acceleration and velocity sensors. When a monitoring program is designed to address concerns related to the level of strain in certain members, fatigue or displacements due to dynamic actions, it is sometimes advantageous to measure those parameters directly, instead of deriving them from acceleration or velocity data. Inhomogeneous construction materials such as concrete, stone or masonry require the use of long-gauge sensors to measure strain, since local sensors can provide erroneous data due to local material changes. In this context, the development of long-gauge-length fiber optic sensor systems, better known by the acronym SOFO, can be considered as a useful addition to the toolkit of those interested in the bridge dynamics. The system can monitor structures over long periods of time, and has been successfully embedded or surface-mounted in a variety of materials such as concrete, steel, and mortar in hundreds of structures. The sensors can have gauge length of up to 20 m and can measure deformations of up to 1% in elongation and 0.5% in shortening. With the appropriate measurement unit, the sensors can measure both long-term static as well as dynamic deformations at acquisition frequencies up to 10 kHz and with sub-microstrain resolution. The possibility of obtaining static and dynamic measurements from the same sensor is another advantage of this technology. This contribution will briefly introduce this fiber optic sensing technology and will than illustrate its application to bridge monitoring through several examples, including the I35W prestressed concrete bridge in Minneapolis USA, the Ile d'Orleans suspension Bridge in Quebec Canada and the Gummenen stone arch bridge in Switzerland.",2011
RAPID PROTOTYPING OF FULL SCALE HOUSE STRUCTURES,Waterjet; Aerated Concrete; Layered Manufacturing; Rapid Prototyping,,"This paper reports on the machining of a construction material (aerated concrete) with a rapid prototyping device, Shapemaker III, which is based on waterjet technology. Preliminary machining tests were carried out to investigate machining conditions (speed and pressure) of separation cuts. Cutting speeds for the waterjet were investigated for two aerated concrete construction materials; autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) in two strengths (348 and 580 psi compressive strength) and a non-autoclaved, fiber reinforced aerated concrete (FRAC) with a 450 psi compressive strength. Cutting samples were prepared in four thicknesses (0.5, 1, 2, and 3 inches) and cut at two pressures (40 and 60 ksi). The 0.5 and 1 inch specimens were cut with good surface finish at over 600 in/min at 40 ksi. The 2 and 3 inch specimens could be cut at 320 and 80 in/min at 40 ksi, respectively. The experimental data was used in the fabrication of rapid prototyping houses with a pure waterjet machine. As results, full scale houses were fabricated with FRAC and Styrofoam. Additionally, a sub-mold of an outdoor fireplace was manufactured with Styrofoam for casting of customized aerated concrete blocks.",2011

However, radium equivalent activities, total and annual effective dose rate and external (gamma), internal (alpha) hazard indexes were calculated and radon concentration, radon specific exhalation rate and effective radium content were measured. Also, indoor radon measurements carried out in each floor (uninhabited) of rough construction (newly construction). The specific concentrations of (238)U, (232)Th and (40)K, from selected building materials, ranged from 3.5 to 114.1 Bq/kg, 1.6-20.7 Bq/kg and 201.4-4928.0 Bq/kg, respectively. The lowest of Ra(eq) is 36.5 +/- 1.8 Bq/kg calculated in bricks while the highest value is 405.2 +/- 20.9 Bq/kg in gas concrete. The average indoor radon concentration is 364.3 Bqm(-3), which is higher than the global mean value, in newly constructed floor. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2011
The apparent thermal conductivity of pozzolana concrete,Lightweight concrete; Pozzolana concrete; Porous materials; Thermal insulation; Modeling; Building,,"The recent development of some lightweight construction materials, such as light concrete, can play an important role as an insulator, while maintaining sufficient levels of mechanical performance. The quality of insulation to provide depends on the climate, the exposure of the walls and also the materials used in the construction. The choice of a material to be used as an insulator, obviously, depends on its availability and its cost. This is a study of natural pozzolanas as basic components in building materials. It is intended to highlight their thermal advantage. It is economically advantageous to use pozzolana in substitution for a portion of the clinker as hydraulically active additions, as well as in compositions of lightweight concretes in the form of pozzolanic aggregate mixtures, which provide mechanical strengths that comply with current standards. A theoretical study is conducted on the apparent thermal conductivity of building materials, namely concrete containing pozzolana. Thermal modeling, apparent to that commonly used for porous materials, has been applied to pozzolana concrete. Experimental results on measurements of the apparent thermal conductivity of pozzolana concrete are reported in this study, using an approach that considers that concrete is composed of two solid ingredients, a binding matrix (hydrated cement paste) and all aggregates. A second comparative theoretical approach is used for the case where concrete consists of a solid phase and a fluid phase (air). (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B. V.

SHEAR CAPACITY OF REINFORCED CONCRETE BEAMS USING RECYCLED COARSE AGGREGATES,Shear capacity; Recycle aggregate; Concrete; Demolition debris; Slump test; Density; Compressive strength; Deflection; Flexural failure; Shear failure,STRENGTH,"An investigation into the shear capacity of reinforced concrete beams using recycled coarse aggregate from crushed graded inorganic particles processed from used construction materials and demolition debris is reported. Eighty (80) beams 150 x 150mm cross-sectional area and 1000mm length and twelve (12) cubes were cast. The concrete mix adopted was 1: 2: 4 (cement: sand: granite/recycled aggregate) with w/c ratio of 0.55 by weight. The percentage replacement of normal coarse aggregate by recycled aggregate was 0% for forty (40) beams and 30% for the remaining forty (40) beams. Six (6) cubes for each mix were cast. The specimens are subjected to line loads to determine their failure behaviour, deflection, crack patterns and post-crack performance. The results showed that the average density and strength of recycled aggregate concrete were slightly lower than that of normal aggregate concrete as the recycled aggregate concrete cubes densities and strengths averaged 97.8% and 88.7% of that of normal aggregate concrete. Each test beam specimen exhibited initial flexural failure at mid span. Diagonal cracks also propagated from each of the supports to the point of the application of load, indicating shear failure.

THE STUDY ON COW FARM AIR POLLUTION FROM DIFFERENT POLLUTION SOURCES,ammonia; carbon dioxide; emission; manure; construction; cow farm,AMMONIA EMISSIONS; LIVESTOCK BUILDINGS; EUROPE,"The objective of this study was to determine the sources and intensity of cow farms air pollution from different air pollution sources. The main gas emission sources in cow farms were estimated, samples were taken and under laboratory conditions gas emission intensity was determined. The highest CO(2) emission was found in solid manure -4065 +/- 59 mg / (m(2) . h). In semi-liquid and liquid manure amount of CO(2) was significantly lower 2340 +/- 39 mg / (m(2) h) and 1490 +/- 34 mg / (m(2) h), respectively. The highest ammonia emission was estimated in liquid manure -194 +/- 6 mg / (m(2) . h) and the lowest in solid manure - 85 +/- 4 mg / (m(2) . h). The time of gas excretion was significantly dependent on the materials of farm construction, e.g. from concrete gases were excreted for 99 h, from different sources of wood from 25 to 71 hours and from rubber coverage only for 8 hours. It was determined, that according to the regression equation is possible to predict the intensity and duration of CO(2) emission from the different construction materials contaminated with manure. It was concluded, that in order to reduce gas emission in the cow farm, it is inappropriate to use concrete waterproofing layer on the surface.",2011
Experimental study of hybrid FRP reinforced concrete beams,Flexural ductility; FRP; FRPRC; Hybrid; Over-reinforcement; Reinforced concrete; Steel,,"Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) has become a practical alternative construction material for replacing steel bars as reinforcement in concrete structures. However, the brittleness of FRP greatly reduces the ductility of FRP-reinforced concrete (FRPRC) beams. In order to improve its flexural ductility, and at the same time retain the high strength feature of the FRP bars, it is proposed that steel longitudinal reinforcement should be added to form a hybrid FRPRC beam. Twelve specimens consisting of plain concrete beams, steel-reinforced concrete (SRC) beams, pure FRPRC beams and hybrid FRPRC beams were fabricated and tested. The test results show the hybrid FRPRC beams behave in a more ductile manner when compared with the pure FRPRC beams. Also, it is observed that a higher degree of over-reinforcement in the beam specimen resulted in a more ductile FRPRC beams. Hence, the addition of steel reinforcement can improve the flexural ductility of FRPRC members, and over-reinforcement is a preferred approach in the design of FRPRC members. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

DISCARDED TYRE RUBBER AS CONCRETE AGGREGATE: A POSSIBLE OUTLET FOR USED TYRES,solid waste management; used vehicle tyres; rubberised concrete properties,,"Discarded vehicle tyres constitute one important part of solid waste which had historically been disposed of into landfills. Recent EU policies on the Landfilling of Waste (Council Directive 1999/31/EC) have however put a ban on the landfilling of whole or shredded tyres, creating an imminent need to investigate any possible viable uses of this waste product. An emerging use is the production of concrete, in which tyre rubber particles partially replace natural aggregates. This has the additional advantage of saving in natural aggregates used in the production of concrete which are becoming increasingly scarce. This research investigated a wide range of physical and mechanical properties of concrete containing recycled tyre aggregates, to assess its suitability as a construction material. The influence of factors such as rubber aggregate content and size, as well as curing time was also considered. The results showed that despite a great loss in strength, this type of concrete was acceptable for various applications requiring medium to low compressive strength. The quantities of concrete produced worldwide for such applications could ensure the viability of this product. Therefore, this type of concrete shows promise for becoming an additional sustainable solution for tyre rubber waste management.",2010
Investigation of Flexural Properties of Cement-Stabilized Macadam Reinforced with Polypropylene Fiber,Portland cement; Construction materials; Fiber-reinforced materials; Base course; Mechanical properties,PLASTIC SHRINKAGE CRACKING; CONCRETE,"With low modulus of elasticity, high strength, excellent ductility, excellent durability, and low price, polypropylene fiber is often used in cement-based materials to improve the toughness and anticracking performance of the matrix composite. The aim of this study was to investigate the flexural properties of cement-stabilized macadam reinforced with polypropylene fiber. Four different fiber volume fractions (0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.1%) and four different cement contents (4, 5, 6, and 7%) were used. Besides, a series of tests without mixing fibers was also carried out. By means of four-point loading method, the flexural strength and flexural modulus of elasticity of cement-stabilized macadam were measured. The results indicate that polypropylene fiber can increase the flexural strength and decrease the flexural modulus of elasticity of cement-stabilized macadam. The flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus are increasing with the increase in specimen curing period. When the fiber volume fraction is not beyond 0.1%, the flexural strength is gradually increasing and the flexural modulus of elasticity is gradually decreasing with the increase in fiber volume fraction. Besides, with the increase in cement content, there is a tendency to increase both in the flexural strength and flexural elastic modulus. Furthermore, polypropylene fiber appears to be highly effective in improving the nondeformability of cement-stabilized macadam.",2010
COMPOSITE BEAM COMPOSED OF STEEL AND PRECAST CONCRETE (MODULARIZED HYBRID SYSTEM). PART IV: APPLICATION FOR MULTI-RESIDENTIAL HOUSING,,COLUMNS; BEHAVIOR,"Multi-residential bearing wall apartments have been constructed to meet the needs of the population growth in metropolitan Korea since 1980. It is extremely difficult to remodel wall-type multi-residential apartments due to the nature of the bearing walls. Residents also experience noise and vibrations generated between floors. It is necessary to introduce a frame structure that enables easy remodelling for the realization of long life of apartment. This paper introduces an efficient, multi-residential modularized hybrid system (MHS). The material quantities, material cost and amount of CO(2) emission for the MHS are compared to that of bearing wall structures (linear rectangular shape and tower shape) and flat slab structures. A multi-residential apartment with an MHS composite girder ensures architectural plan flexibility and easy remodelling, while the floor heights are maintained at the same floor height as in bearing wall structures. The material cost of MHS multi-residential housing can be reduced by reducing the amount of concrete and reinforcement steels required for the slabs and walls. The MHS also reduces CO(2) emission in accordance with the reduction of construction materials. Dry-type construction can be environment friendly by reducing human resources, temporary materials and waste. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2010

The main reason for that was based on the need to classify the environmental impact levels through indicators to assess the damage level process. The scale allowed converting information to estimate the environmental impact caused. Indicators were defined trough the requirements and classification criteria of impact aspects considering the eco-design theory. Moreover, the scale allowed classifying the materials and processes environmental impact through four score categories which resulted in a single final impact score. It was concluded that the EI scale could be cheap, accessible, and relevant tool for environmental impact controlling and reduction, allowing the planning and material specification to minimize the construction negative effects caused in the environment.",2010
Behaviour of Slurry Infiltrated Fibre Concrete (SIFCON) under triaxial compression,Triaxial strength; Confining pressure; Steel fibre; SIFCON; Failure criterion,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; STRESS-STRAIN CURVES; STEEL-FIBER; REINFORCED-CONCRETE; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES,"Slurry infiltrated fibre concrete (SIFCON) is one of the recently developed construction material that can be considered as a special type of high performance fibre reinforced concrete (HPFRC) with higher fibre content. In the current research, triaxial compressive behaviours of high strength concrete (HSC), HPFRC and SIFCON were investigated. Purposefully, laboratory tests employed on four types of 75 x 150 mm cylindrical specimens with different steel fibres volumes (0, 2, 5 and 10%). All tests were conducted under four different confining pressure levels (0, 5, 15 and 21.5 MPa) according to triaxial conditions. Consequently, stress-strain curves were obtained and governing failure patterns and failure criterions of HSC, HPFRC and SIFCON samples were discussed. According to the results increasing of fibre volumes increases peak stress, energy absorption, toughness and Poisson's ratio while increasing confining pressures increases peak stress, energy absorption and toughness. Also, this may cause concrete to behave as a plastic material. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2010

Waste foundry sand and its leachate characteristics,Waste foundry sand; Leachate; Leaching test methods,LEACHING PROPERTIES; PRODUCTS; METALS,"Solid waste management has become one of the global environmental issues, as there is continuous increase in industrial by-products and waste materials. Due to lack of land filling space and its ever increasing cost, utilization of waste material and by-products has become an attractive alternative to disposal. Waste foundry sand (WFS) is one of such industrial by-product which could be used in various applications including construction materials such as Controlled Low-Strength Material (CLSM) and concrete. The beneficial use of such by-products in construction materials results in reducing the cost of construction materials' ingredients and also helps in reducing disposal problem. The leachate obtained from such materials may contain hazardous compounds, which may possibly effect the environment. So, it is important to know the characteristics of leachate obtained from waste foundry sand.

In this research, we took Beijing city, a rapid developing city as a case study, and examined material flows of urban residential building system based on a survey of typical residential buildings in the urban areas of Beijing city. The quantitative analysis were made to describe the input, transformation/accumulation, and output of building materials from the year 1949 to 2008, and a comparative analysis was done to identify the differences of material uses among the buildings with different architectural structures as masonry-concrete, and steel-concrete. During the period from 1949 to 2008, there were six main materials of cement, sand, gravel, steel, bricks and timber used in urban residential building system in Beijing. The total amount of material imported into the system was 5.1 x 10(8) t, among which the accumulated amount was 4.7 x 10(8) t, an accumulation rate of 92.5%, and the total of building wastes reached 3.9 x 10(7) t. Among the buildings with two architectural structures, the total amount of material use for buildings with steel-concrete structure was larger than masonry-concrete. It was found that the buildings with steel-concrete structure experienced a rapid increase since the year 1979 in Beijing. As a result of rapid urban development, the large-scale reformation and demolishment of urban old buildings also led to a rapid growth of the amount of building wastes. And the building wastes generated in the process of reformation and demolition began to exceed that produced in the process of new buildings construction. The amount of building wastes generated from 2004 to 2008 accounted for 52.2% of the total that generated from 1949 to 2008. From this research, the rapid development of Beijing's residential building system in the past 60 years became a big ecological pressure for urban sustainable building development. It is important to change the traditional model of urban construction, and develop some sustainable or ecologically friendly construction technologies to enhance the capacity of recycling and reuse of residential building wastes for realizing a sustainable urban building construction and management in Beijing.

Mechanical and thermal properties of SM 490 at high temperature for fire engineering design,metal; deformation; mechanical properties; tensile test; fire resistance,DEFORMATION-BEHAVIOR,"The use of structural steels is rapidly increasing in the high-rise building market in Korea because of its higher quality, construction period, and lower cost than the ordinary construction materials such as concrete. However, steel structures have a serious drawback. Severe fire conditions tend to weaken them and they can collapse. To overcome this weakness, steel structures must meet the fire resistance requirements in the building laws or building codes of the respective country. In Korea, the method for evaluating fire resistance in steel structures is currently being developed with performance based engineering. Fire engineering offers calculation methods for evaluating fire resistance. The calculation depends on the accurate mechanical and thermal data of the materials at high temperature. The purpose of this paper consists of two parts: one is to obtain data on mechanical properties at high temperature and to gather thermal data, and the other is to compare the calculation with an experimental fire test. By using the results of tensile strength tests conducted at high temperature, the regressive equation for yield strength and elastic modulus of structural steel were derived. Increasing patterns of temperature from cold to high were very similar between the results of analysis and those of fire tests. This similarity held until the half of fire resistance was obtained.",2010
GFRP bar element to strengthen timber connection systems,Timber structures; bending strength; longitudinal notched lap joint; glass Fibre reinforced plastic,,"Timber is an excellent construction material with a strength-to-weight ratio comparable with steel and concrete. It is necessary to strengthen the timber, particularly in the weak joint places, in order to obtain both durability and originality. The aims of strengthening in the connecting places are to decrease the stress concentration, keep on the fibre continuity, and reduce disadvantages of connection element including nail and bolts. Nowadays, Glass Fibre Reinforced Plastics, (GFRP) produced via pultrusion process, are used to strengthen the structural elements because of its high strength, light weight, corrosion resistance and easy application of the structures. The aim of this study is to obtain the fibre continuity of connecting places of timber using GFRP bar elements. Mechanical performances of the connecting places of longitudinal notched lap joints have been investigated. Specimens have been prepared from black pine timber. Seven different groups of specimens, one group massive timber, one group only adhesively bonded and remaining strengthened with pultruded GFRP bar samples, have been prepared to determine the performances of the connections. The specimens have been tested subjected to bending strength and the obtained results have been compared to with each others. The outcomes demonstrate the fact that the bending strength of the connection strengthened with GFRP bar has about 300% higher than adhesively bonded connection. Timber is an excellent construction material with a strength-to-weight ratio compare to with steel and concrete. However, its use to date in the construction industry has been hampered by the weakness of the jointing systems used. In order to decrease the stress concentration and reduce disadvantages of connection element it is necessary to strengthen timbers particularly in the weak joint places.",2010

Consequently, manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs) and nanocomposites are being considered for various uses in the construction and related infrastructure industries. To achieve environmentally responsible nanotechnology in construction, it is important to consider the lifecycle impacts of MNMs on the health of construction workers and dwellers, as well as unintended environmental effects at all stages of manufacturing, construction, use, demolition, and disposal. Here, we review state-of-the-art applications of MNMs that improve conventional construction materials, suggest likely environmental release scenarios, and summarize potential adverse biological and toxicological effects and their mitigation.

Increase of the bearing load of the joints for the bamboo tubes of the German-Chinese House of EXPO 2010 by optimization of the bamboo-concrete bond,,,"The German-Chinese-House at the EXPO 2010 in Shanghai impressively shows the combination of traditional (bamboo) and modern (membrane fabric) construction materials. The light, innovative structure causes low CO(2)-emissions as the main structural elements of the framework are bamboo tubes with a length of up to 8 m and diameters of up to 20 cm. As the joining technique of bamboo is difficult due to its tubular section and sleek surface, this article describes a new method to join bamboo by filling it locally at its ends with concrete. Steel bars within the infill can be then used for classic steel joints such as screws. The surface preparation and the concrete composition are crucial to allow for a durable bonding between concrete and bamboo. The configuration used here leads to design forces R(d) of more than 50 kN for tension and more than 150 kN for compression.",2010
A SOFTWARE PROGRAM FOR PLANNING AND DESIGNING BIOGAS PLANTS,Anaerobic digester; Biogas plant; Building material; Concrete construction; Mathematical modeling; Software program; Spark mapping,,"To plan and design biogas plants, several calculations should be carried out; this requires time and effort, with the possibility of making mistakes. The objective of this study was to develop a tool to assist designers in planning and designing biogas plants by providing a new mathematical model and software program to save time and effort. A mathematical model was developed to plan and design biogas plants and their concrete structures. Subsequently, an electronic spark map (decision tree) was developed, and the mathematical model was integrated into the electronic spark map. Afterwards, C# (C Sharp) programming language was used to develop a software program by integrating the electronic spark map and the mathematical model, and making the user interface. The developed software is able to plan and design biogas plants, specify the dimensions of the different tanks (raw slurry tank, liquid organic matter tank, digester tank, secondary digester tank, and residue storage tank), and compute the required amounts of construction materials (iron rods, cement, sand, and gravel) required to build the designed structures. Furthermore, it calculates the capital investment and the fixed, variable, and total costs of the construction. Data from seven biogas plants were used to carry out the model validation and to evaluate the software program. The differences between actual and calculated values were determined, and the standard deviations were calculated. The coefficients of variation range between 3% and 7%. Furthermore, the calculated accuracy of the software program is 98%.",2010
"Bioremediase a unique protein from a novel bacterium BKH1, ushering a new hope in concrete technology",Bioconcrete; Compressive strength; Hot spring bacteria; Mortar; Protein; Silica,BIOMINERALIZATION; DEPOSITION,"A novel hot spring bacterial strain was isolated and characterized from Bakreshwar, West Bengal, India. Phylogenetic analysis of partial 16 S-rRNA gene sequence (697 nucleotides) suggested that the isolate was affiliated with the family 'Firmicutes' and 99.8% homologous with Thermoanaerobactor thermohydrosulfuricus. A unique thermostable and high pH tolerant protein (28 kDa) secreted by the bacterium was isolated whose N-terminal partial sequence (25 AA) suggested that the protein was similar to mammalian carbonic anhydrase-II. This bacterium or its unique protein both increase the compressive (>25%) and tensile (>20%) strengths, hardness and elastic modulus of cementitious material when incorporated to the cement/cement-sand mixture. The protein (named as bioremediase) possesses silica leaching activity, which is increased by calcium ions. No esterase and/or proteolytic activities are present in the protein. The use of such isolated bacterium or its protein in concrete technology develops new construction material that may be used for self-healing concrete in future. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Bond Behavior of prestressed Strands in UHPC Part 1: Tests on Bond Strength and Transfer Length,,CONCRETE; BEAMS,"Bond Behavior of prestressed Strands in UHPC Part 1: Tests on Bond Strength and Transfer Length Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC) is an appropriate construction material for pretensioned girders To ensure an economic and safe design a detailed knowledge of the behavior of pretensioned strands in the anchorage zone is essential The dimension of the bond anchorage zone favors the cost-effective design of pretensioned girders, especially when the shear resistance is decisive However, a minimum concrete cover has to be maintained to avoid splitting cracks in the transmission zone, since they lead to an uncontrolled increase in transfer length and may cause a premature anchorage failure This paper, which resulted from the priority program SPP 1182 [1] funded by the German Research Foundation, presents the results of investigations on the bond behavior of strands in UHPC Part 1 deals with the experimental investigations and in part 2 a bond model is derived to design the transfer length.",2010
A new apartment construction technology with effective CO2 emission reduction capabilities,CO2 emission; Greenhouse gas; Bearing wall apartment; MHS (Modularized Hybrid System) apartment; Construction materials,,"This construction industry is responsible for over 30% of the total industrial CO2 emission in Korea, and bearing wall apartment housing represents more than 50% of all housing in Korea. A new multi-residential Modularized Hybrid System (MHS) for construction of apartment housing may reduce the amounts of construction material used as well as the amounts of CO2 emission. This paper collected and compared data on the CO2 emission properties of construction materials for bearing wail and new MHS apartments including concrete, reinforcing steels, formwork, and gypsum board. MHS construction techniques reduce CO2 emission by 25.1% by requiring less concrete and reinforcing steels for slabs and walls that would otherwise be needed in conventional bearing wall structures. This paper also shows that migration to a Rahmen structure utilizing an MHS frame can provide an alternative solution to reducing CO2 emission. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2010

Specifically, in the case of contaminated construction materials, the generation of an electroosmotic flux, with the corresponding dragging due to water transport, is a crucial mechanism to succeed in the treatment of decontamination. Therefore, it is of great interest trying to optimize the treatment by the addition of specific electrolytes enhancing the electrokinetic phenomena. Most of the data of zeta potential found in literature for construction materials are based in micro-electrophoresis measurements, which are quite far of the real conditions of application of the remediation treatments. In this paper, electrophoretic and electroosmotic experiments, with monolithic and powdered material respectively, have been carried out for mortar, brick and granite clean and contaminated with Cs, Sr, Co, Cd, Cu and Pb. The electrolytes tested have been distilled water (DW), Na(2)-EDTA, oxalic acid, acetic acid and citric acid.

Comparative Performance of the SMAC Made with the SBS- and ST-Modified Binders,Stone mastic asphalt; Modified binders; Optimization,FLEXIBLE PAVEMENTS; RECLAIMED POLYETHYLENE; MECHANISTIC APPROACH; ASPHALT; MIXTURES; BITUMENS; POLYMERS; EVA,"Styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) and starch (ST) have been used by many to modify asphalt cement and to improve the properties of asphalt concrete. In this investigation, SBS and ST were used to modify asphalt cement. The basic properties of modified asphalt binders and stone mastic asphalt concrete (SMAC) containing such asphalt binders were studied and compared with those of asphalt cement. Marshall stability, Marshall Quotient, tensile strength, tensile strength ratio, rutting resistance, flexural strength, and resilient modulus were carried out on the SMAC. A mechanistic-empirical design approach was used for estimating the improvement in service life of the pavement or reduction in thickness of SMAC and base layer for the same service life due to modification the SMAC. In addition, an optimization table was prepared to select the type of SMAC for any field applications. The analyzes of test results show that the performance of SBS-modified SMAC is slightly better when compared to ST-modified SMAC. The temperature susceptibility can be reduced by the inclusion of SBS and ST in the SMAC. The results of multilayer elastic analysis presented herein indicate that the pavement consisting of SBS and ST-modified SMAC as a surface layer is beneficial in reducing the construction materials. Actual savings would depend upon the option exercised by the designer for reducing the thickness of an individual layer.",2010
"Effect of Thermoplastic Aggregates Incorporation on Physical, Mechanical and Transfer Behaviour of Cementitious Materials",PET plastic aggregates; Cement; Physico-mechanical properties; Sound and thermal insulation,,"Plastic waste management is one of the major environmental concerns in the last decade. Theworld's annual consumption of plastic materials has increased from around 5 million tons in the 1950s to nearly 100million tons in 2001. The exponential growth of plastic waste has incited a search for alternative use as recyclingmaterials. Buildingmaterials is an interesting outlet. In this paper, mortars containing different amounts of polyethylene terephtalate (PET) particles, as partial replacement of sand, were prepared and characterised by destructive and non-destructive testing. Various volume fractions of sand 3, 10, 20 and 50% were replaced by the same volume of plastic, and two different thicknesses of PET aggregateswere used. Dry density, apparent porosity, intrinsic permeability, compressive strengths and ductile behaviour, elastic modulus, flexural strengths, ultrasonic wave velocity and thermal conductivity were investigated. The results of this study show the feasibility of the recycling of PET plastic materials as aggregates in cementitious materials. These new composites have low specific gravity, high level of sound insulation, relatively weak thermal conductivity and significant ductility; moreover, the use of plastic waste in concrete to develop new construction materials is valuable for both the construction and the plastic recycling industries.",2010
Effect of low quality aggregates on the mechanical properties of lightweight concrete,Ignimbrite; pumice; lightweight concrete; compressive strength; splitting tensile strength,ELASTIC-MODULI; STRENGTH; PREDICTION; IGNIMBRITE; TIME,"Ignimbrite is one of the pyroclastic volcanic rock formations. Its soundness, lightness and shape workability are the most advantageous properties. These properties get its usage since prehistoric ages as construction materials, like bricks and caves. This kind of pyroclastic volcanic rock exists all over the world, particularly in volcanic and high seismicity provinces. Some physical and mechanical properties of ignimbrite rock samples are obtained in order to interpret influence of aggregate strength on concrete produced and for comparing with other lightweight aggregate concretes. The ignimbrite and pumice are used as crushed aggregate in the present work. The aggregate concentration of concrete specimens is designed in four different groups by using 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100% ignimbrite and pumice, as a proportion of aggregate volume with the same water cement ratio of 0.6 and the dosage of 300 kg/m(3) lightweight concrete manufactured. All concrete specimen groups are settled in steel formworks and water cured for 7, 14 and 28 days. According to the pumice and perlite like lightweight concretes, the ignimbrite concretes had higher strength. So, its usage as a construction material like lightweight concrete, brick or panel is more advantageous in producing cheap anti-seismic constructions. Therefore, ignimbrite concretes lighter the building, get less earthquake loads and behave better than gas, pumice or perlite concrete. Another advantage of ignimbrite is its occurrence in active fault zones (earthquake areas) all over the world.",2010
Effect of partial replacement of sand with dry oyster shell on the long-term performance of concrete,Oyster shell; Substitution ratio; Long-term performance; Durability,AGGREGATE,"To evaluate the practical application of crushed oyster shells (OS) as construction materials, an experimental study was performed based on equal materials proportion and the partial replacement of saturated-surface-dry (SSD) sand with dry oyster shell. More specifically, the long-term mechanical properties and durability of concrete with OS partially substituted for fine aggregate were investigated. Test results indicate that long-term strength of concrete with 10% OS replacement is almost identical to that of normal concrete. However, the long-term strength of concrete with 20% OS replacement is appreciably lower than that of normal concrete. Therefore, higher OS substitution has the possibility of negatively influencing the concrete long-term strength increment. Elastic modulus of concrete with OS replacement decreases as the substitution mixture ratio increases. Specifically, the modulus is reduced by approximately 10-15% when OS are used for 20% of the fine aggregate. The drying shrinkage strain increases as the substitution ratio (SR) of OS is increased. In addition, the existing model code for drying shrinkage and creep does not coincide with the test results of the present study. A prediction equation for drying shrinkage has been developed. The utilization of OS as a fine aggregate in concrete has a positive effect on freezing and thawing resistance and water permeability is also considerably improved. However, OS has no apparent effect on carbonation and chemical attack of concrete. Finally, it is noted that the strength, elastic modulus, drying shrinkage, freezing and thawing resistance, and permeability are significantly affected by increased OS substitution, particularly for long-term performance, while other properties such as creep and carbonation, as well as chemical attack test results, were not substantially affected.

The Tectonic Integration of Louis I. Kahn's Exeter Library,Louis Kahn; tectonic; piping distribution,,"Louis Kahn's architectural works embody his rational tectonic epistemological perspective by exhibiting the ways he respected the nature of construction materials and how he built his structures in accordance to how he believed that space, itself, desired to be portrayed. From the Exeter Library, which was completed in 1972, it is evident that Kahn integrates two different structural systems, bricks and reinforced concrete, into a design concept that exhibits his profound respect for the innate characteristics of the chosen construction materials and the space that they create. The current study focuses on the concept of spatial formation, structural systems, piping distribution, and their integration into the construction of Louis I. Kahn's Exeter Library. A review of the literature is first presented, which is followed by a comparison and analysis of a number of various plans, and 3D simulation models of the project. The relationships existing between the methods that Louis Kahn employed and the nature of the materials he used during spatial formation are presented, which is followed by a description of how these techniques enabled Kahn to express his rational tectonic ideals in the integration of construction materials and piping distributions. It is shown, for example, that Kahn endeavored to integrate various types of piping distribution in relation to the demands of construction and structural forms. In this way, Kahn's work interprets different characteristics of space in various types of architecture to display a rational tectonic method that responds to the form of a space.",2010
Monitoring of Water Content in Building Materials Using a Wireless Passive Sensor,LC sensor; wireless; humidity; building materials,FOOD QUALITY,"This paper describes an innovative design of a wireless, passive LC sensor and its application for monitoring of water content in building materials. The sensor was embedded in test material samples so that the internal water content of the samples could be measured with an antenna by tracking the changes in the sensor's resonant frequency. Since the dielectric constant of water was much higher compared with that of the test samples, the presence of water in the samples increased the capacitance of the LC circuit, thus decreasing the sensor's resonant frequency. The sensor is made up of a printed circuit board in one metal layer and water content has been determined for clay brick and autoclaved aerated concrete block, both widely used construction materials. Measurements were conducted at room temperature using a HP-4194A Impedance/Gain-Phase Analyzer instrument.",2010
Pelletisation of fly ashes as a lightweight aggregate,,CONCRETE; STRENGTH; REUSE,"This study investigated the use of solid waste fly ash in the production of lightweight concrete. Fly ash is an industrial waste obtained from the coal-fired thermal generating power plant and it is used in the production of additive construction materials. In Turkey more than 15 million tonnes of fly ash is produced each year, but only a small amount is utilised. The industrial waste fly ashes used in this study came from the power plant at Iskenderun Sugozu, Cayirhan, Tuncbilek and Seyitomer. Lightweight aggregate manufactured from the fly ash and Na-bentonite was used in a pelletisation process. The lightweight concrete manufactured from fly ash aggregate was analysed in terms of the slump and density of fresh concrete and the density, compressive strength and tensile splitting strength of hardened concrete. In the present study, the effects of fly ash aggregates from different power plant when used for lightweight concrete production purposes were investigated and the results obtained were quite satisfactory for the related design requirements.",2010
Experimental study of using PCM in brick constructive solutions for passive cooling,PCM; Buildings; Energy savings; Passive cooling,THERMAL-ENERGY STORAGE; PHASE-CHANGE MATERIALS; HEAT-STORAGE; CONCRETE,"This work presents the results of an experimental set-up to test phase change materials with two typical construction materials (conventional and alveolar brick) for Mediterranean construction in real conditions. Several cubicles were constructed and their thermal performance throughout the time was measured. For each construction material, macroencapsulated PCM is added in one cubicle (RT-27 and SP-25 A8). The cubicles have a domestic heat pump as a cooling system and the energy consumption is registered to determine the energy savings achieved. The free-floating experiments show that the PCM can reduce the peak temperatures up to 1 degrees C and smooth out the daily fluctuations. moreover, in summer 2008 the electrical energy consumption was reduced in the PCM cubicles about 15%. These energy savings resulted in a reduction of the CO2 emissions about 1-1.5 kg/year/m(2). (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2010

This paper presents the effects of using a different character of mixing constituent such as size of sand, various amounts of gas foaming agent, and a range of superplasticizer content on the compressive strength and density of aerated concrete with and without POFA. POFA passing 300-mu m sieve was ground until its fineness is 99% passing 45-mu m sieve was incorporated as partial cement replacement. POFA cement-based aerated concrete was prepared by adding 20% of POFA by weight of cementitious materials. It was discovered that POFA cement-based aerated concrete continues to exhibit higher strength compared to ordinary portland cement aerated concrete throughout the experimental program. Thus, this newly found material could be used as environmental friendly construction material since it possess adequate strength fulfilling the requirement in ASTM allowing it to be used as nonload-bearing element yet having lower density below 1,000 kg/m(3).",2010
"Comprehensive Evaluation of AIMS Texture, Angularity, and Dimension Measurements",Aggregate; Texture; Angularity; Imaging; X-ray computed tomography; Material technology,WIDE-RANGE; PARTICLES; SHAPES,"Aggregates are the most widely used construction materials in the world in structures built from both asphaltic and portland cement concrete composites. The performance of these composites is affected by aggregate shape characteristics (e.g., angularity, texture, and dimensions). The aggregate imaging system (AIMS) is a computer automated system that was developed to measure aggregate shape characteristics using digital camera images of aggregates. This paper addresses four issues concerning AIMS measurements: (1) enhanced ways of handling and classifying the large data sets typically generated; (2) enhanced automation in processing fine aggregate images that appear to contain touching particles; (3) an improved consideration of measurement variability or repeatability between different operators, different AIMS units, and for aggregate placement and orientation; and (4) comparison of AIMS dimensional measurements with true three-dimensional measurements using X-ray computed tomography on a large coarse aggregate data set. The various aggregate sets used in this study covered a broad range of angularity and texture. The AIMS measurements of the ratios of dimensions were found to have excellent agreement with the more accurate X-ray computed tomography values, but the measurements of the individual dimensions were systematically low by about 10%.",2010
A NUMERICAL MODEL FOR MASONRY-LIKE STRUCTURES,masonry; descent methods; energy minimization; unilateral materials; plasticity,ADMISSIBLE STRESS-FIELDS; HOMOGENIZATION TECHNIQUE; INTEGRATION; EVOLUTION,"Masonry has historically been one of the most widely used construction materials. Despite this, there is a lack of computational tools for the analysis of masonry structures compared with what is available for steel and concrete structures. One of the main reasons is likely to be found in the peculiar mechanical behavior of masonry, which shows a small and unpredictable resistance in tension and a nonlinear inelastic behavior in compression. In this paper we put forward a constitutive model for masonry based on the extension to associate path-dependent plasticity of the classical normal, elastic, no-tension model. This new model allows the onset of fracture and irreversible crushing of the material and accounts for a wider variety of stress states within the structure, highlighting the progress of pseudorigid kinematics. The elastoplastic problem is decomposed into a sequence of nonlinear elastic problems formulated in variational form, which are solved by searching for the minimum of a suitable functional via descent methods. The model is implemented in variational finite element code and validated against analytical solutions and experimental tests. Applications to realistic cases are presented showing the capability of the model to reproduce nontrivial cracking and crushing patterns.",2010
The mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures with Recycled Concrete Aggregates,Mechanical properties; Asphalt mixtures; Recycled Concrete Aggregates; Low volume roads,,"The need for sustainable asphalt highway design and construction is becoming a priority within the asphalt transportation industry. This trend is necessitated by the high diminishing rate of construction materials, pressing demand on existing landfill sites, rising dumping fees, and reduced emissions into the environment. Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RCA) as sustainable aggregates in Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) is therefore investigated in this research project. The objective of this study is to characterize the mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures with recycled concrete aggregates for low volume roads (herein, the equivalent standard axle load number is low). In this study, the RCA is substituted for Michigan traprock virgin aggregates (VA) in a light traffic volume HMA (control mix) at the rate of 25, 35, 50 and 75. The hybrid VA-RCA HMA is then assessed using the Superpave (TM) mix performance specifications. The rutting potential using Asphalt Pavement Analyzer (APA), Dynamic Modulus (E*), Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) for moisture susceptibility, Indirect Tensile Test (IDT) resilient modulus and the Construction Energy Index (CEI) are determined to evaluate the field performance suitability or otherwise of the mix. All 4 hybrid VA-RCA HMA mixes passed the minimum rutting specification of 8 mm. The master curves for the hybrid mixes showed that the dynamic stiffness of the hybrid mixes were less than that of the control 4E1 mix, and it decreased when the RCA increased in the mix. In terms of moisture susceptibility, the tensile strength ratio increased with decreasing RCA; with only the 75% of RCA in the mix failing to meet the specification criterion. The compaction energy index proved that using RCA would save some amount of compaction energy. It is recommended that a certain amount of RCA in HMA is acceptable for low volume roads.

An investigation on the concrete properties containing colemanite,Colemanite; concrete; mechanical properties; concrete radiation shielding,CEMENT; BORON; TRANSMISSION; STRENGTH; WASTES,"A radiation dose above the maximum permissible limit is harmful to our environment and our bodies. Study of radiation absorption in material has become an important subject to protect living creature and environment from harmful effect of radiation. Thus it is desirable to have the knowledge about the effective materials for neutron and gamma ray shielding. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world for this purpose. The aggregate of concrete plays an essential role in modifying concrete properties and physical-mechanical properties of concrete affect significantly shielding properties of concrete. This paper summarizes the results of investigation carried out on the concrete containing colemanite at different ratios. The intent of this research was to investigate the effect of the colemanite on physical and mechanical properties of concrete using colemanite as replacement aggregate. Slump, air content, compressive strength, split tensile strength, Schmidt hardness, modulus of elasticity, freeze-thaw durability, unit weight and pulse velocity were physical and mechanical properties investigated.

Chemical Research and Climate Change as Drivers in the Commercial Adoption of Alkali Activated Materials,Alkali activated material; Inorganic polymer; Geopolymer; Climate change; Concrete,,"Portland cement production has been identified as a primary contributor to the world's Greenhouse gas emissions, calculated at around 5-8% of all manmade emissions worldwide. The majority of these emissions are inherent to the chemistry of cement and the high-temperature processing required for its synthesis, and so can only be avoided by radical changes in construction materials chemistry and synthesis pathways. Inorganic polymer (including ""geopolymer'') binders provide an alternative to traditional cements with approximately 80% less CO2 emissions, and are derived from industrial waste materials such as fly ash and metallurgical slags, which additionally provide a means of valorizing these wastes. This paper reviews the technical and commercial factors driving the growing commercial adoption of geopolymer technology, and explains that an understanding of the chemistry and mechanisms of geopolymer synthesis is pivotal for the optimal mix design of ""green'' concretes in industry. Demand pull by a carbon conscious market at a time of growing public awareness of climate change continues to be the key driver for the short term adoption of geopolymer concrete. A detailed chemical understanding of the properties of geopolymers, such as setting time, workability and durability, plays an enabling role in the commercialization process.",2010
A review of alternative materials for replacing existing timber sleepers,Railway sleepers; Replacement sleepers; Hardwood timber; Alternative materials; Fibre composites,CONCRETE SLEEPERS; RAILWAY SLEEPERS,"Timber is the most widely used material for railway sleepers, however, as a sleeper material it deteriorates with time and needs appropriate replacement.

One of the first patented applications concerned the protection of ornamental stone by means of a microbially deposited carbonate layer, i.e. biodeposition. The promising results of this technique encouraged different research groups to evaluate alternative approaches, each group commenting on the original patent and promoting its bacterial strain or method as the best performing. The goal of this review is to provide an in-depth comparison of these different approaches. Special attention was paid to the research background that could account for the choice of the microorganism and the metabolic pathway proposed. In addition, evaluation of the various methodologies allowed for a clear interpretation of the differences observed in effectiveness. Furthermore, recommendations to improve the in situ feasibility of the biodeposition method are postulated. In the second part of this paper, the use of microbially induced carbonates as a binder material, i.e. biocementation, is discussed. Bacteria have been added to concrete for the improvement of compressive strength and the remediation of cracks.

Utilization of power plant bottom ash as aggregates in fiber-reinforced cellular concrete,,PORTLAND-CEMENT PASTES; PORE STRUCTURE; MINERAL ADDITIVES; FLY-ASH; STRENGTH; POROSITY; MORTAR,"Recently, millions tons of bottom ash wastes from thermoelectric power plants have been disposed of in landfills and coastal areas, regardless of its recycling possibility in construction fields. Fiber-reinforced cellular concrete (FRCC) of low density and of high strength may be attainable through the addition of bottom ash due to its relatively high strength. This paper focuses on evaluating the feasibility of utilizing bottom ash of thermoelectric power plant wastes as aggregates in FRCC. The flow characteristics of cement mortar with bottom ash aggregates and the effect of aggregate type and size on concrete density and compressive strength were investigated. In addition, the effects of adding steel and polypropylene fibers for improving the strength of concrete were also investigated. The results from this study suggest that bottom ash can be applied as a construction material which may not only improve the compressive strength of FRCC significantly but also reduce problems related to bottom ash waste.

Sustainability of construction industry - Quality control of fly ash for its application into construction materials,quality control; fly ash; fluidity; superplasticizer; sedimentation volume,,"The use of industrial byproducts and recycling materials in construction is very favorable to the sustainable development of our modern society. The aim of this paper is to establish the quality control of concrete with fly ash, which is by-product from a coal-fired electrical power plant. In order to establish effective quality control of fly ash concrete, the effect of the quality of fly ash on fluidity of concrete were examined. The required dosage of superplasticizer and air entrained agents showed a high correlation with the methylene blue adsorption of fly ash. Sedimentation volume of cement-fly ash mixture had a high correlation with the fluidity of the fly ash concrete. Sedimentation also reflected the effect of quality of fly ash on the required dosage of superplasticizer. Therefore it could be concluded that the quality of fresh concrete with fly ash can be controlled by the sedimentation volume of cement-fly ash mixture.",2010
REVIEW OF k(M) COEFFICIENTS OF BUILDING MATERIALS,,,"The Design of a lightning protection system requires the determination of the separation distance according to DIN EN 62305-3 (VDE 0185-305-3). The coefficient km is used to take into account construction material in a given separation distance calculation. Only two values can be applied, 1 for air and 0.5 for concrete and bricks. Due to the introduction of new materials used in structures of buildings the question of a revision of the existing km coefficients came up.",2010

In particular, nanocomposite hybrids were prepared dispersing a commercial organomodified montmorillonite (Cloisite 30B) in two different polymeric matrices, one based on fluoroelastomers (Fluoline CP), the other on silane and siloxane (Antipluviol S). The obtained systems were characterized by several techniques (SAXD, DSC, TGA, FT-IR, contact angle measurements, colorimetry), before and after accelerated aging due to UV exposure, in order to evaluate the effect of the nanoscale dispersion of the organoclay on the properties and the UV stability of the treatments.",2010
Brick as a Construction Material in the Modernization Process of The Ottoman Architecture,brick; Ottoman; architecture; modernization; imported; factorial; traditional; local; catalogue; collection; inscription; sign; stamp,,"Brick used with stone in an alternate order -especially on monumental masonry buildings-is one of the basic construction materials in Ottoman classical architecture. Parallel to the announcement of Tanzimat Declaration (1839), to the political and economical relations improved with European states and to the industrial Revolution in Europe, an effective change had been seen on design concept and construction techniques in Ottoman architecture. Many new buildings were built using modern materials and imported techniques such as solid brick (in western norms) masonry walls, steel beams at the horizontal and vertical bearers, cement and concrete. The product of modern solid bricks in western standards had been realized in Ottoman territories in the last quarter of 19(th) century. The base of this research is constituted on 334 imported and local product solid bricks which remain to Zihni Goger's (firstly documented for this research), to Uzay Yergtin's, to Aynur Ciftci's and to the Yildiz Techical University, Department of Architectural Conservation's private collections. Most of the bricks are in a good condition, clean and have stamps. From the stamps one learns where they were produced, in which country or even city, the names of the plants, the logos and the dates of product. During the documentation every brick is numerated, photographed and a catalogue is prepared including the dimensions of the bricks. The demolotion of the buildings made of solid brick masonry walls-especially those which are not registered as an essential cultural asset- the interventions undertaken and the use of new materials during restoration of bearer walls have damaged the original bricks. Finally they were not conserved and documented. The aim of this paper is to determine the change of the production and the standarts of the bricks, to indicate their varieties, their fields of use and their conservation problems before and after the modernisation period of Ottoman architecture. It is intended to take into consideration the conservation and documentation of this material during renovations reflecting the original construction technique of the period that belongs to monumental and civil architecture.",2010
On 4R Principle in the Rehabilitation of Concrete Historic Buildings,Concrete; rehabilitation; micro-structure; reduce; reuse; recycle; regeneration,,"The 4R principle refers to reduce, reuse, recycle and regeneration, which should be implemented in the process of concrete treatment. In terms of the special micro-structural properties and self-repairing capacity, concrete is one kind of regenerative construction materials. Through proper handlings, self-repairing (crack close-up) of concrete cracks is possible in the concrete hydration damaged region. Due to the effect of heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent crystal growth of calcium hydroxide, a better bonding strength forms interlocking the new and old concrete interfaces. A proposal on the relationship between the self-repairing, regeneration function of concrete and the rehabilitation of historic buildings is suggested, this is based on the formed process of the bonding strength of the interfaces and the function on concrete repairing. Besides the constitution and features of the microstructure of concrete, the relationship between the micro-structure and the macro-mechanical property is also investigated in this paper.",2010
Retrofitting of Timber Beam Ceilings with the Timber-Concrete Composite Construction,Timber-concrete composite construction; timber beam ceilings; retrofitting,,Regarding the redevelopment of existing residential buildings the timber-concrete-composite (TCC) construction is an innovative possibility to toughen up timber beam ceilings. Thereby a concrete slab is added to the timber beams. Both parts of the construction are connected by using special shear connectors. In this case timber is mainly loaded in tension and concrete is generally loaded in compression. The bearing capacity as well as the serviceability of the ceiling can be improved by this composite construction. The idea of combining the construction materials timber and concrete in the way that they both can take and carry on loads is not new. In Germany it was mentioned in 1939 for the first time. The cityscape of Central European towns is mainly characterized by buildings constructed before the 50(th) of the last century. The protection of the historical main structure of these buildings is getting more important today. Floors built up till that time were primarily made of timber. Research in Germany has been intensified during the last decade. This paper will show the specific properties of timber-concrete composite floors. Several metallic combing agents exist currently. Type and distance of the connection members influence the load bearing behavior of the composite construction. The main types used in Germany will be presented in this paper. The possible ways of calculating timber-concrete composite ceilings will be given and the design basis will be explained.,2010
Early-Age Autogenous Shrinkage of High-Performance Concrete Columns by Embedded Fiber Bragg-Grating Sensor,high performance concrete column; early-age autogenous shrinkage; fiber Bragg-grating strain sensor; temperature compensation,,"High-performance concrete (HPC) as a promising construction material has been widely used in infrastructures and high-rise buildings etc. However, its pretty high autogenous shrinkage (AS) especially in its early age becomes one of the key problems endangering long-time durability of HPC structures. This paper carried out the early age AS research of large scaled HPC column specimens by embedded Fiber Bragg-Grating (FBG) strain sensor. Temperature compensation for FBG strain sensor by thermocouple was also attempted in this paper, and the results were reasonable and acceptable comparing with the result compensated by FBG temperature sensor.

The role of particle technology in developing sustainable construction materials,Concrete; Geopolymer; Particle packing; Particle shape; Porosity,HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE; FLY-ASH; INORGANIC POLYMER; VOIDS RATIO; GEOPOLYMER; PACKING; CEMENT; METAKAOLIN; MICROSTRUCTURE; SIMULATION,"This paper presents a brief review of the role of particle technology in the development Of low-CO(2) aluminosilicate 'geopolymer' binders and concretes as an alternative to traditional Portland cement-based materials. The role of particle shape in particular is highlighted, both in the context of its effect on paste rheology and on water demand. The spherical particles of fly ash and the platy particles of metakaolin show opposite effects in each of these areas, and this must be understood and controlled if an effective geopolymer concrete is to be designed. The angular particles of blast furnace slag are also important in determining paste rheology and porosity. The selection of the correct combination of aggregate gradings is critical in maximising concrete durability, as the ability of aggregates to pack sufficiently densely in a hardened concrete product then hinders the ability of aggressive external agents to migrate into the concrete and cause structural damage to either the binder or the embedded steel reinforcing.

SIMPLE QUALITY CONTROL METHOD FOR THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF STRAIN HARDENING CEMENTITIOUS COMPOSITES (SHCC),Quality control; Tensile strength; Strain Hardening Cementitious Composites (SHCC); Four point bending test,,"As an emerging advanced construction material, strain hardening cementitious composite (SHCC) has seen increasing field applications in recent years. Reliable data on tensile properties, including tensile strength and tensile strain capacity, are needed for structural design and for quality control. However, existing uniaxial tensile tests are relatively complicated and sometime difficult to implement, particularly for quality control purpose in the field. A simple inverse method based on beam bending test was presented by the authors [1] for indirect determination of tensile strain capacity, aimed at quality control of SHCC in field applications. This paper extends this method to also determining the tensile strength based on beam bending test data. This proposed method (UM method) has been validated with uniaxial tensile test results with reasonable agreement. In addition, this proposed method is also compared with the Japan Concrete Institute (JCI) method. Comparable accuracy is found, yet the present method is characterized by much simpler experiment setup requirement and data interpretation procedure. Therefore, it is expected that this proposed method can greatly simplify the quality control of SHCCs both in execution and interpretation phases, contributing to the wider acceptance of this type of new material in field applications.",2010
THE EFFECT OF FIRE EXPOSURE ON THE PERFORMANCE OF HIGH STRENGTH CONCRETE FRAMES,High strength concrete; fire; spalling; residual strength,ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; RESIDUAL STRENGTH,"High strength Concrete (HSC) is likely to be exposed to high temperatures during fire such as other construction material. The residual mechanical properties of HSC such as strength and elastic modulus after such exposures are still of great importance in terms of the serviceability of structures. The non-reversible changes due to the fire, may significantly weaken the HSC member(s) after the event of fire. In general view, the structural integrity and load bearing capacity of HSC structure might be affected considerably because of the fire. This paper presents the results of analytical study on the durability of HSC 2D frames after fire exposure. At first, the standard fire (ISO 834 elevated temperature) is applied on the ten HSC 2D frames (including HSC beam and columns) and then their post fire structural behaviour in lateral load is investigated numerically using push over method. The effect of reduction of the elastic modulus and the compressive strength has been considered in these analyses in beams and columns. The results of these ten models show the enormous effect of fire exposure in the lateral behaviour of the HSC frame in earthquake. In other hand, the results of these analysis showed that even a local fire in only one story could make a great affects on the lateral performance and reliability of HSC frames.",2010

The environmental parameters have led to the armor stones deteriorating faster than laboratory testing indicates. This paper provides an overview of the decomposition of the four rock types (limestone, granite, quartzite, and concrete) over the five field inspections. The meteorological variables were used to calculate the number of freeze-thaw events that occurred over the time period. The water wave height data were used to calculate stone deterioration from wave actions. The results from the field observations, together with the meteorological analysis, were used to help better parameterize the numerical model and assist in identifying problems in scalability from laboratory test samples to field samples.",2010
"Strengthening of Concrete, Metallic and Timber Construction Materials with FRP Composites",,INTERFACES,"This paper provides a review of research being conducted at The University of Hong Kong (HKU) on the strengthening of concrete, metallic and timber construction materials with externally bonded fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. The motivation of such research is to enhance our understanding of the interfacial behaviour between the FRP and the three different substrate materials via FRP-to-concrete, -metal, and-timber joint tests. Of the three substrate materials, concrete has clearly experienced the most research activity to date by the wider research community, followed by that of metal and then that of timber. In order to progress the extensive knowledge base of FRP-to- concrete behaviour, research at HKU is aimed at enhancing the bond strength of the FRP via the addition of anchorage. The anchor of choice is the so called FRP anchor and its effectiveness in anchoring FRP flexural strengthening applied to reinforced concrete (RC) slabs is also presented. For the metal and timber substrate materials, HKU research is more focused at this stage on understanding the influence of key fundamental variables affecting interfacial behaviour such as FRP geometry, surface preparation and substrate material characteristics.",2010
SETTING AND HARDENING OF AGRO/CEMENT COMPOSITES,Bagasse fiber; Unbleached bagasse pulp; Cement matrix; Mechanical strength,FIBER-CEMENT COMPOSITES,"In this study, the use of bagasse fiber (BF) and unbleached bagasse pulp (BP) in a cement matrix, as a raw material, to produce lightweight construction materials is reported. The bagasse was used as partial replacement of cement at different levels: 0% (control cement), 1%, 2% 3%, and 4% by weight. The average size of bagasse fibers was less than 2 mm. Although a reduction in the physical and mechanical strength was observed, the incorporation of either fiber or pulp increased the water of consistency and setting time. A composite containing 4% of bagasse fibers can be used for lightweight concrete. FT-IR spectra showed that the BF or BP adversely affect the rate of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) formation by decreasing its promotion.",2010
Composite UHPFRC-concrete construction for rehabilitation most recent advances and applications,,,"Ultra-High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concretes (UHPFRC) are characterized by a unique combination of extremely low permeability, high strength and deformation capacity (tensile strain hardening), Extensive R&D works performed during EU projects SAMARIS and ARCHES have demonstrated that the UHPFRC technology is fast, efficient and price competitive for the rehabilitation or reinforcement of reinforced concrete structures. Most challenging applications can be now addressed with this technique, using UHPFRC components available locally. The environmental assessment of the rehabilitation of a bridge in Slovenia, with a local UHPFRC, with a new ecological recipe (50% cement replacement) showed the major advantages of this technique in a perspective of sustainable use of construction materials. Basic concepts, material compositions and properties, as well as most recent applications in Switzerland and Slovenia are presented and discussed in the paper.",2010

The compressive strengths and ultrasound pulse velocities, resonance frequencies, bending strengths, and setting times of prepared samples have been determined by conducting tests on 4 cm x 4 cm x 16 cm samples prepared for this purpose at 2, 7, and 28 d. When the setting times are evaluated, the heat released as a result of hydration declines, and the initial heat is reduced. A significant increase in the early compressive strength as an effect of prehydration method has been observed. It is evaluated that prehydration is an economical and practical method that call be enhanced and used in the production of the ready-mix concrete and prefabricated construction materials.",2010
Effects of remediation and hauling on the air void stability of self-consolidating concrete,,,"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is a highly flowable construction material that commonly experiences high slump flow loss due to long hauling times. The main objective of this study was to compare two different techniques of remediating slump flow loss, overdosing and retempering, and their effect on the air void characteristics of SCC. One 635 mm (25 in.) slump flow mixture was subjected to hauling times between 20 and 90 minutes and subsequently remediated back to the target slump flow. The air void characteristics (specific surface and spacing factor) were measured on the fresh concrete using an Air Void Analyzer. The two forms of remediation investigated were able to produce SCC mixtures that met the target air void characteristics for adequate freeze-thaw durability and target fresh properties required for self-consolidating concrete. Both forms of remediation necessitated an increased dosage of high range water reducing admixture with increasing hauling time.",2010
Investigation of the effect of aggregate on the performance of permeable concrete,,,"Presently natural resources are increasingly consumed due to rapid urbanization, so that various strategies are being investigated by engineers to protect and restore natural ecosystems all over the world. Permeable pavement, due to its high porosity and permeability, is considered as an alternative to traditional impervious hard pavements for the sake of controlling stormwater in an economical and friendly environmental way. Concrete as a construction material has been used in pavement surfaces since 1865 and during the past 20 years, permeable concrete developed into a subset of the broader family of pervious pavements. It is normally made of single sized aggregate bound together by Portland cement. Considering about influences of aggregate properties in the concrete compositions, different aggregate types and sizes were tried and their effects on the compressive strength and permeability of permeable concrete were investigated. The optimum aggregate for pervious concrete is consequently recommended.",2010
Investigations on flexural behavior of high strength manufactured sand concrete,,,"Sand is basic concrete making construction material required in large quantities. Hence, in the present scenario, it is necessary to find the most suitable substitute for sand, easy to produce and has all the required qualities for use in concrete. Manufactured sand is one among such materials to replace river sand, which can be used as an alternative fine aggregate in mortars and concretes. To attain the set out objectives of the present investigation, M50 grade concrete has been considered. Strength properties such as cube compressive strength and flexural strength of beams, and load carrying capacity, moment carrying capacity, behavior of strains in compression as well as tension fibers and cracking patterns have been studied for the grade of concrete. In this paper a total of 15 cube specimens 150 x 150 x 150 mm and 10 beam specimens of size 1500 x 150 x 230 mm were ea for testing.

Experimental evaluation of fiber reinforced concrete fracture properties,Fibers; Fracture; Mechanical properties; Mechanical testing,EPSILON-DESIGN METHOD; RILEM TC 162-TDF; COMPRESSION; BEHAVIOR,"Concrete is now universally recognized a construction material vital and essential for the regeneration and rehabilitation of the infrastructure of a Country. The last few decades have now shown that high strength concrete, with a compressive strength of 100-120 MPa can be readily designed and manufactured. There have also been several advances made in the development of fiber reinforced concrete to control cracking and crack propagation in plain concrete. and to increase the overall ductility of the material. However, there are now many types of fibers with different material and geometric properties, and the exact fracture behavior of fiber reinforced concrete materials is not clearly understood. The overall aim of this paper is to establish the fracture properties and fracture behavior of concrete containing two widely used types of fibers, namely, steel (high modulus) and polypropylene (low modulus). The experimental investigation consisted of tests on cubes and notched prismatic specimens made from plain concrete and fiber concrete with 1% and 2% of steel or polypropylene fibers. The cube tests and the three point [)ending tests on notched specimens were carried Out according to RILEM specifications, and extensive data on their compressive and flexural tensile behavior and fracture energy were recorded and analyzed. The results obtained from the tests are critically assessed. and it is shown that fibers contribute immensely to the structural integrity and structural stability of concrete elements and thereby improve their durable service life.

Optimisation of the Mixing Process for Producing Self-Compacting High-Performance Concrete,,,"Today's concrete structures call for high-tech construction materials, for example self-compacting high-performance concrete (SCHPC) as self-compacting high-strength concrete (SCHSC) and self-compacting ultra-high-strength concrete (SCUHSC). These concretes are defined as concretes with special properties. This development aims to increase the packing density through the selection of coarse and fine aggregates combined with a reduction in the water-to-binder ratio (w/b). To achieve this goal, state-of-the-art concrete plants need to meet certain minimum requirements. In an effort to realize shorter construction times and develop new concrete process technologies, and in view of ever-increasing degrees of component loading, international research has been going on for approximately 30 years for materials that have led, among other things, to the development of high-performance concrete. A trend towards the development of customized concretes, for example of SCHPC, can also be observed in the German construction industry.",2010
Prediction of the Impact of Flow-Induced Inhomogeneities in Self-Compacting Concrete (SCC),,,"SCC is nowadays a worldwide used construction material. However, heterogeneities induced by casting may lead to variations of local properties and hence to a potential decrease of the structure's load carrying capacity. The heterogeneities in SCC are primarily caused by static and dynamic segregation. The present paper reports property maps for a beam based on particle distributions at the end of casting derived from numerical flow simulations. A finite volume based numerical model is used to predict particle distributions at the end of casting, which are then converted into property maps using semi-empirical relations from the literature.",2010
Experimental Study on Thermal Characteristics of Environment-Friendly Blocks with Water-Absorbing Polymer,Heat island; Highly absorbing polymer; Bottom ash; Recycle; Block,PEAT; ADSORPTION; SPHAGNUM; PAVEMENT,"Urbanization together with increased population and industrialization has increased impermeable areas including asphalt and concrete pavement, leading to potential dangers of environmental disasters in urban area. While environmental pavements have been investigated to mitigate these problems in some countries such as Germany and Japan, little work has been done in Korea. Furthermore, most studies on environmental pavements have focused on permeable asphalt pavements. This study was intended to develop new materials for water-absorbing pavement blocks to control pavement temperature and storm water runoff. Bottom ash, which is a coal combustion by-products, was used as a composing material for these blocks. A polymer with water absorption ratio of 76% was used as a water-retention material for the pavement blocks. The effect of block compositions on mechanical characteristics, compressive strength and porosity were examined as well as thermal characteristics. This water-absorbing polymer is likely to be suitable to be used with the bottom ash blocks. The time required to fill the pores of the blocks with the polymer ranged from 9 to 14 sec, indication that the polymer can be readily applied to the blocks. The final products with optimum compositions satisfied the Korean Standard for blocks and possessed an excellent water-retentive ability. Experiments are ongoing to measure the properties of the blocks for further application as a new construction material.",2010
Strength Enhancement of Geopolymer-based Concretes by Mixed Alkaline Activators,Geopolymer; concrete; water glass; concrete sludge,,"As a relatively new material, geopolymer concrete offers benefits as a construction material for sustainable development.

It's reported that geopolymer based concrete releases only 1/6 CO2 compared to those of based Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). In this study, to obtain a new type of construction material with lower CO2 emission and energy consumption, fly ash, waste concrete sludge and metakaolin were used as the main components. Solution of NaOH/KOH and water glass were applied as alkaline activator. The amount of water glass and the ratio of alkaline/water glass were varied to reach an optimal value.

Improvement of Urban Land use and Land cover Classification Approach in Arid Areas,remote sensing; classification approach; arid areas; object-oriented classification method,IMAGE SEGMENTATION TECHNIQUES; ACCURACY ASSESSMENT; EXTRACTION,"Extraction of urban land-use information is base step of urban change detection. However, challenges remain in automatic delineation of urban areas and differentiation of finer inner-city land cover types. The extraction accuracy of built-up area is still unsatisfactory. This is mainly due to the heterogeneity nature of urban areas, where continuous and discrete elements occur side by side. Another reason is the mixed pixel problem, which is particularly serious in an urban environment. The built-up areas in arid areas may confuse with nearby bare soil and stony desert, which present very similar spectral characteristics as construction materials such as concrete, while they are often surrounded by farmland. This study focuses on improving urban land use and land cover classification approach in typical city of China's west arid areas using multi-sensor data. Pixel-based classification of the NDBI and Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) and object-oriented image classification were used in the study and the classification dataset including Landsat ETM (1999), CBERS (2005), and Beijing-1 (2006).

PALM OIL FUEL ASH (POFA): AN ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY SUPPLEMENTAL CEMENTITIOUS MATERIAL FOR CONCRETE PRODUCTION,Palm oil fuel ash; Mechanical properties; Durability; Concrete,BLENDED PORTLAND-CEMENT; HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; RICE HUSK ASH; REPLACEMENT MATERIAL; MORTAR; WASTE; RESISTANCE,"As the amount of concrete being produced and consumed around the world continues to increase, environmental concerns about the high levels of carbon dioxide emissions from the production of cement have resulted in growing interest in the field of supplemental cementitious materials in order to reduce the amount of cement required for making concrete. Various studies have been conducted on different industrial waste products in order to determine the effectiveness of their use as a partial replacement for cement in concrete. One such industrial by-product is palm oil fuel ash (POFA), which is produced by burning palm oil shell and husk as fuel in a palm oil mill boiler in order to produce steam to generate electricity for the palm oil extraction process. Although POFA is a hazardous material that is usually sent to the landfill without any commercial gain, POFA has been found to have pozzolanic properties; it is highly reactive and can be used as a unique cement replacement for building construction materials if the POFA is ground to reduce the particle size (GPOFA). Studies conducted on the use of POFA as a pozzolanic material to improve the mechanical properties and durability of concrete has obtained satisfactory results. Consequently, POFA can be considered an environmentally-friendly substitute for cement when employed as a supplemental cementitious material in concrete.",2010
PRINCIPLES AND USE OF ACID-RESISTANT CONCRETES,,,"The requirements on constructions materials for industrial reinforced-concrete structures have risen notably in recent years, because these building objects have been assuming ever greater and more technically demanding dimensions. This trend is placing greater importance on the use of special high-performance concretes. Acid resistance is a special requirement. Concretes with high acid resistance can be used in wastewater systems, industrial plants, agricultural buildings and in the construction of the cooling towers of power plants. Acids can damage the binder matrix, the reinforcing steel and, to some extent, the aggregate of the concretes. The resistance of reinforced-concrete structures to attack from acid can be guaranteed through coatings or by an appropriate choice of materials for the composition of the concrete. With the high-performance concrete Duracrete (R) bevo, which can be used in prefabricated and ready-mixed form in many ways, it has been possible to develop a construction material with outstanding resistance to acid attack.",2010

The leachates were treated with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) and the APDC complexes of As(III), Sb(III) and Se(IV) were retained on a non-polar (C-18) sorbent, whereas As(V), Sb(V) and Se(VI) passed through. The SPE method was optimized in a multivariate approach: the effect of sample pH, APDC concentration, mixing time and sample percolation rate on the extraction of the analyte species was studied, and the optimum conditions of the significant parameters, i.e. sample pH and APDC concentration, were identified and experimentally verified. The two oxidation states of the elements can be separated using the SPE method from solutions of pH 3-8 (As), pH 4-10 (Sb) and pH 3-9 (Se) treated with 0.08% (w/v) APDC. The effect of matrix interferences was studied and the use of benzene sulfonate to remove interfering matrix metal ions by ion-pair SPE was demonstrated. The limit of detection of As(V), Sb(V) and Se(VI) by ICP-MS was 0.09, 0.14 and 0.37 mu g L-1, respectively. A condition was established for the preconcentration of As(III), Sb(III) and Se(IV) by elution with 3.0 M HNO3 in a back-flushing mode. With a preconcentration factor of 50, concentrations of As(III), Sb(III) and Se(IV) down to 1 6 ng L-1 could be detected using the SPE method in combination with ICP-MS. The SPE method was validated using spike recovery tests, and was used to determine the oxidation states of the target elements in leachates of a concrete material.

One potential product, insulating concrete forms (ICFs), offers possible advantages in energy and environmental performance when compared with traditional construction materials. Even though ICFs are in part derived from a petroleum-based product, the benefits in the use phase outweigh the impacts of the raw material extraction and manufacturing phase. This paper quantitatively measures ICFs' performance through a comparative life cycle assessment of wall sections comprised of ICF and traditional wood-frame. The life cycle stages included raw materials extraction and manufacturing, construction, use and end of life for a 2,450 square foot house in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Results showed that even though building products such as ICFs are energy intensive to produce and thus have higher environmental impacts in the raw materials extraction and manufacturing phase, the use phase dominated in the life cycle. For the use phase, the home constructed of ICFs consumed 20 percent less energy when compared to a traditional wood-frame structure. The results of the impact assessment show that ICFs have higher impacts over wood homes in most impact categories. The high impacts arise from the raw materials extraction and manufacturing phase of ICFs. But there are a number of embedded unit processes such as disposal of solid waste and transport of natural gas that contribute to this high impact and identifying the top unit process and substance contributors to the impact category is not intuitive. Selecting different unit processes or impact assessment methods will yield dissimilar results and the tradeoffs associated with every building product should be considered after studying the entire life cycle in detail.",2010
An Experimental Investigation on the Structural Behavior of FRP-Concrete Composite Compression Members,FRP; FRP-concrete composite pile; flexural strength; CFFT; RCFFT,,"In construction industries, new construction materials are needed to overcome some problems associated with the use of conventional construction materials due to the change of environmental and social requirements. Accordingly, the requirements to be satisfied in the design of civil engineering structures are diversified. As a new construction material in the civil engineering industries, fiber reinforced polymeric plastic (FRP) has a superior corrosion resistance, high specific strength/stiffness, etc. Therefore, such properties can be used to mitigate the problems associated with the use of conventional construction materials. Nowadays, new types of bridge piers and marine piles are being studied for new construction. They are made of concrete filled fiber reinforced polymeric plastic tubes (CFFT). In this paper, a new type of FRP-concrete composite pile which is composed of reinforced concrete filled FRP tube (RCFFT) is proposed to improve compressive strength as well as flexural strength of an RCFFT. The load carrying capacity of proposed RCFFT is discussed based on the result of experimental and analytical investigations.",2010
Form Factor for the Design of Pultruded FRP Structural Members under Compression,Buckling and post-buckling; compression member; pultruded structural shape; form factor; design; experiment,,"As a new construction material, fiber reinforced polymeric plastic structural shapes are readily available. Therefore, construction and structure rehabilitation using FRP materials are an ever increasing trend because of FRP material's superior chemical and mechanical properties compared with those of conventional construction materials such as steel and concrete. Among the FRP materials, pultruded fiber reinforced polymeric plastics are the most popular for civil engineering applications. However, it has relatively low modulus of elasticity and also cross-section of structural shapes is composed of plate components such as flange and web. Therefore, stability is an important issue in the design of pultruded structural shapes. For the design of pultruded structural member under compression, buckling and post-buckling strengths of plate components should be taken into account. In the structural steel design following AISC/ LRFD, this effect, in addition to the buckling strength, is incorporated with a form factor. In this research, the form factor for the design of pultruded structural shapes under compression is investigated. Based on the analytical study, the form factor for the design of pultruded structural shapes have been suggested.",2010
DURABILITY OF FIBER REINFORCED POLYMER MATERIAL FOR CIVIL ENGINEERING APPLICATION,Durability; bridge structures; testing; freeze-thaw; environment loads,COMPOSITE STRUCTURES; TEMPERATURE; STRENGTH,"Fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) materials are considered to be advantageous for longevity, particularly for civil engineering application since durability is of significant concern. They are increasingly used due to the perceived durability over other traditional construction materials, such as steel and concrete. However, this perception needs to be quantified in relevant specifications, so that engineers can better understand the material and have the confidence to specify them for routine application. To that end, this research effort had a focus on durability testing procedure for FRP materials for bridge engineering application. The following destructive and non-destructive tests were studied in the test program of this research effort. 1) Ultimate strength test under bending. 2) Frequency test using nondestructive experimental dynamic analysis. 3) Loss factor test also using nondestructive experimental dynamic analysis. These tests were performed on FRP material samples typically used for bridge deck, which has been the most popular FRP structural component in bridges. The tests were performed in a variety of media encountered in civil engineering application. 1) Frozen. 2) Freeze-thaw in distilled water with 2-hour and 5-hour cycles. 3) Freeze-thaw in salt water with 2-hour and 5-hour cycles. The test results show that the tested FRP material is able to sustain the harsh environmental conditions with little or no damage. The developed procedure is also recommended to be the basis for standard acceptance testing for the material and the intended application.",2010
INVESTIGATION OF STRUCTURAL BEHAVIOURS IN CONCRETE BRIDGE DECK SLABS REINFORCED BY GFRP BARS WITH CONSIDERATION OF COMPRESSIVE MEMBRANE ACTION,nonlinear finite element analysis; GFRP; compressive membrane action; bridge decks,,"With increasing of ages in service, the durability of reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs became significantly influenced by corrosion. Due to the high corrosion-resistance ability in Glass Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (GFRP), this reinforcement type is developing to be a promising alternative reinforcement construction material for concrete bridge decks. This paper reveals the study of structural behaviours of GFRP reinforced concrete bridge deck slabs through nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) with consideration of compressive membrane action (CMA). In the comparison of current design standards, it was found that, due to CMA, the loading capacities were far larger than those predicted by traditional methods. Based on the previous research on bridge deck slabs, finite element models were established and used to be compared with experimental tests. According to the accurate validation results, the analysis results are discussed and conclusions on the compressive membrane action in the bridge decks are presented.",2010
HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE FOR GREEN CONSTRUCTION,carbon footprint; green construction; sustainable development,,"Concrete is a widely used construction material. However, the production of concrete for new buildings and the eventual demolition of old buildings generate a large carbon footprint that causes global warming and a large volume of solid waste that uses up valuable landfill space. In order to mitigate these problems, there is a pressing need to reduce the consumption of concrete and extend the service life of concrete buildings. For such purposes, the authors have been advocating the usage of more high-performance concrete (HPC), which has higher strength, durability and workability than normal concrete. The higher strength could reduce the volume of concrete needed whereas the higher durability could extend the service life of concrete buildings. In this regard, there is often the misunderstanding that HPC, which usually contains more cementitious materials, would generate a larger carbon footprint. Herein, life-cycle analysis of the carbon footprint of concrete construction is conducted to demonstrate that although HPC. tends to have a higher cementitious material content per unit volume, due to the reduced volume of concrete needed and the extended service life of buildings, its carbon footprint is actually much lower.",2010
PRECAST TO LAST - HONG KONG PUBLIC HOUSING EXPERIENCE,high-rise domestic blocks; prefabrication; public housing; sustainable development; volumetric precast components,,"Around 30% of the families in Hong Kong are living in about 680,000 public rental housing units provided by the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HA) in a high-rise high density urban living environment. We are building an average of about 15,000 flats per year. One way to achieve sustainable development is through the use of precast and prefabrication construction technologies to bring forth sustainability benefits that include: better quality of works, enhanced buildability and site safety, and more environment-friendly site operations conservation of construction materials and minimization of construction wastes. Since its introduction of precast facades, semi-precast slabs and precast staircases in the 1980's, the HA has viewed prefabrication as a change for sustainability benefits and a challenge to explore prefabrication opportunities amidst constraints. As a result, the HA has made good progress on this front, from planar to volumetric and from minor to major structural prefabrication. In 2008, the HA completed a pilot project that pioneered two prefabrication innovations: precast structural shear walls and large-scale volumetric precast components (VPC). For each domestic block, the precast concrete volume reaches a record of 60%, involving about 10,000 pieces of precast elements which include about 1,200 VPCs per block. Its completion bears witness to the fruit of success of Research & Development and lays good foundation for further technological advancements for enhanced sustainable construction in future public housing developments.",2010
IMPROVING THE COST AND VALUE OF TALL BUILDINGS USING COMPUTATIONAL DESIGN OPTIMISATION,performance-based design; structural optimisation; sustainable development; tall buildings,REINFORCED-CONCRETE BUILDINGS; STIFFNESS DESIGN; STEEL BUILDINGS,"Contemporary tall buildings are expensive structures. Not only does a tall building demand greater consumption of construction materials, but it also requires higher operational and maintenance costs over its lifetime. Structural engineers are facing the challenge of making structures more efficient and economical while ensuring improved green values and sustainability. The quest for a way of performing a cost effective and environmentally efficient design in a short period of time has led to the development of advanced numerical optimisation techniques for structural design of tall buildings. This paper presents an innovative computer based technique that minimises the material cost while maximising floor area efficiency with enhanced habitability of tall buildings. Specifically, a formal treatment of the iterative analysis and design procedure is made so that the structural design decision-making process involved in tall building design can be formulated and solved by a numerical optimisation algorithm. An overview of the computer based structural optimisation and its recent advances will be summarised with practical applications to a number of notable tallest building projects in Hong Kong. The value and significance of the computer based structural optimisation will be illustrated through the 118-story International Commerce Center and the 74-story Harbourside Development.",2010
ANALYSIS OF MOMENT ROTATION RELATIONSHIPS OF ULTRA-HIGH PERFORMANCE CONCRETE SLABS,UHPC; Moment rotation relationship; Steel fibres,,"The analysis and design of NSC (normal strength concrete) members against air blast loads needs the moment rotation relationships of these members. Ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is a new high strength, high deformation capacity and high toughness construction material by comparison with conventional concrete. Thus the conventional method may not be suitable to determine the required moment rotation curves for UHPC members. In this paper, the member performance is analyzed using two approaches, moment curvature and moment rotation. The first stage of analysis considers the elastic response while a moment-rotation relationship is used to predict the plastic response when a crack forms. The moment-rotation approach was designed to incorporate any parameters necessary so that members of varying sectional and material properties could be modeled for. This has allowed a number of parametric analyses to be conducted investigating the effects of steel fibres within UHPC. The findings show that steel fibres add to the energy absorption capacity of UHPC members, hence making these members more suitable for surviving large blasts in comparison with conventional RC members.",2010
REDUCING EARLY THERMAL CRACKING AND CARBON FOOTPRINT OF CONCRETE BY ADDING PULVERIZED FUEL ASH,Adiabatic temperature rise; carbon footprint; pulverized fuel ash; sustainability,ADIABATIC TEMPERATURE RISE; SHRINKAGE; AGGREGATE; CEMENT,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the urbanization of mankind. However, there are inherent problems pertaining to concrete. Firstly, concrete is prone to cracking which can adversely affect the serviceability and durability of concrete structures. Secondly, since the manufacturing of cement emits a lot of carbon dioxide, concrete contributes a large carbon footprint to planet earth. These two problems may be ameliorated by incorporating pulverized fuel ash (PFA) into concrete mixes. With addition of PFA to reduce the cement content, the adiabatic temperature rise due to cement hydration can be reduced, thereby abating the thermal contraction during cool-down phase and hence the early thermal cracking. The reduced cement content also directly reduces the carbon footprint of concrete. To quantify the benefits of PFA, a testing programme consisting of 7 concrete mixes without PFA added and 14 concrete mixes with PFA dosages at 20% and 40% was launched. It is found that the incorporation of PFA suppressed the adiabatic temperature rise by 4 degrees C to 14 degrees C, and the carbon footprint of PFA concrete mixes was 22% to 43% less than that of cement concrete.",2010
Laboratory and Field Comparison of Long-Gauge Strain Sensing Technologies,,,"Strain is one of the most interesting parameters to be measured for the monitoring of civil and industrial structures. When the global behavior of the structure is of interest, it is important to select a sensor that integrates the strain measurement over a basis that is much larger than the size and distance of local defects in the construction material. For reinforced concrete structures, this means that a gauge length of ten times the aggregate size or ten times the average distance between cracks is recommended in order to obtain an average measurement of strain which is representative of the global behavior of the element under investigation. Many different sensing techniques are available nowadays to measure long-gauge strain, each with advantages and limitation. This paper compares the performance of the most widely used techniques with regards to the precision, accuracy and thermal influence. The sensors were first tested in identical laboratory conditions and then installed side-by-side in a reinforced concrete bridge to evaluate their field performance under real conditions, in particular under the daily temperature variations.",2010
Performance of Mud Bricks with Shred Tires as Sustainable Construction Materials,Shred Tires; Kaolin; Mud Bricks; Sustainable Materials; Recycle,,"This paper presents a survey on the role of the shred tires in the mud brick compressive strength. Mud brick construction is very compatible with the laws of ecology and harmonizing with the environment. Mud brick consists of clay, water and other different materials. The massive implementation of mud bricks in construction can make an evolution due to its low cost and its high compressive strength compared to concrete blocks, which are massively used nowadays. Many experiments have been recently conducted on mud blocks without additional materials, and they resulted in weak compressive strength. Therefore, many testing in mud bricks with different material were needed. Experiments on the role of shred tires in the compressive strength of the mud bricks were performed. The survey used this cheap material in the experiments, since it's considered as part of the environmental pollution and is not very used after the consumption in the automotive industry. The results showed an increase in the compressive strength of the mud bricks with shred tires.",2010
Loam Building Techniques and Typologies in the Urban Planning Context,alternative building materials; sustainable architecture; appropriate building construction; low cost construction; loam construction; urban planning,,"Urban development is a prime concern of the developing world. Due to limited resources and the high costs of imported materials the focus is increasingly directed on locally available materials such as loam. Buildings of loam have been constructed in many regions worldwide ever since. The modern building context is widely detached from these old traditions and is focused on globally contemporary materials such as concrete and steel. Compared with these contemporary materials loam is inexpensive, locally available and advantageous concerning the building climate. The aim of this paper is to introduce a catalog of housing typologies for different urban densities. These typologies are categorized based on their building structures consisting of different contemporary and alternative construction materials. Contemporary materials are represented by reinforced concrete and masonry. Alternative structures focus on loam and timber as building materials. A table provides the planner with essential information on dimensions, material consumption and embodied energy of different building typologies and materials.",2010
Design and construction of permanent waterproof tunnel linings based on sprayed concrete and spray-applied double-bonded membrane,,,"Design and construction issues for permanent waterproof tunnel linings based on sprayed concrete are reported. This method considers sprayed concrete as a permanent and long-term durable construction material for the final support of tunnels. The waterproofing of this type of lining is realized by the use of a double-bonded spray-applied membrane which is embedded in the sprayed concrete lining in a sandwich structure. Hence, the final lining consists of a composite system in which the waterproofing membrane and the sprayed concrete primary ground support and the sprayed concrete inner lining act together mechanically in a continuous structure. Two recent projects have successfully employed this system; the Tunnel de Viret of Lausanne Metro M2 in Switzerland and the A3 Hindhead road tunnel in the UK. Specific experiences from these two projects are reported. The specific experiences reported in this paper refer to the sprayed membrane system Masterseal 345 supplied by BASF Construction Chemicals.",2010
Micro- and Nanoscale Characterization of Effect of Interfacial Transition Zone on Tensile Creep of Ultra-High-Performance Concrete,,ELASTIC-MODULUS; MODEL; SHRINKAGE,"Ultra-high-performance concretes (UHPCs) are nano- to microstructurally optimized construction materials whose use presents significant opportunities for improving the performance of prestressed bridge girders. In UHPC girders, transverse shear reinforcement may be eliminated because of the high tensile strength of the material achieved through the use of short dispersed steel fibers as part of the mix. Use of the concrete's tensile strength requires that the long-term tensile performance be understood to avoid brittle shear failure in service. The scope of the present study was characterization of the tensile creep of UHPCs under different thermal treatment regimens, with complementary assessment of the underlying mechanisms by characterization by nanoindentation and scanning electron microscopy. In this study, tensile-creep tests were conducted for a period of 1 year with UHPCs subjected to three different moist thermal curing regimes (i.e., early curing at 90 degrees C, early curing at 60 degrees C, and curing at 23 degrees C). The effects of the curing conditions were further examined by nanoindentation and scanning electron microscopy, with particular emphasis being placed on the influence of thermal curing on the fiber-matrix interface. On the basis of the findings of this multiscale study, it is proposed that an enhanced fiber-cementitious matrix interfacial region, created by thermal curing, contributes significantly to the observed reductions in tensile-creep deformation.",2010
"Characterization of High Early-Strength, Self-Consolidating Concrete for Design of Pretensioned Bridge Elements",,,"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is an innovative construction material that can be placed into forms without mechanical vibration. Precast, prestressed concrete plants require that the concrete used to fabricate their structural members attain high early strength. High early-strength SCC could provide significant value for precast plants. However, the high early-strength SCC mixture constituents, proportions, and construction may affect the hardened properties, and SCC may not provide the same performance as conventional concrete. SCC and conventional concrete mixture proportions designed for precast, prestressed bridge elements were evaluated to characterize the associated mechanical properties, shear characteristics, bond characteristics, and creep. To assess the applicability of SCC in prestressed girder systems, four full-scale girder deck systems containing conventional concrete and SCC precast girders were fabricated and tested. Results from this research indicate that the AASHTO Load and Resistance Factor Design Specifications can be used to estimate the mechanical properties of high early-strength SCC. With respect to shear characteristics, a more appropriate expression is proposed to estimate the concrete shear strength for SCC girders with a compressive strength greater than 10 ksi (69 MPa). Bridge girder deck systems containing relatively small (Texas Type A) girders containing high early-strength SCC exhibited similar flexural performance as bridge girder deck systems with girders containing conventional concrete. Results indicate that the AASHTO equations for computing the nominal moment capacity, strand transfer length, and strand development length may be used fir SCC girder deck systems similar to those tested in this study.",2010
Ceramic tiles adding waste foundry sand to different clays,recycling; construction materials foundry sand red clay,MOLDING SANDS; CONCRETE,"This work continues the research on recycling of waste foundry sand as aggregate in the manufacture of bricks and red clay tiles Initially, clay with a major content of soil was used The obtained specimens showed high porosity due to the combustion of the organic matter present Moreover, this type of raw material has properties that vary greatly according to the extraction sites In order to improve quality and achieve uniformity in the properties of the obtained products, samples with commercial clay in similar composition are studied in this work The commercial clay (from Olavarria, Argentina) is composed of a mixture of mineral clays without any content of black soil Several samples were obtained with aggregates of different percentages of foundry sand to the commercial clay, with a compaction pressure of 25 MPa These samples were heat treated to 930 C for three hours The characterization of raw materials and products was carried out by using different techniques optical and scanning electron microscopies, porosity and density measurements and mechanical properties determination, among others The results were analyzed on a comparative basis with those of samples produced from clays containing black soil The obtained materials meet the standards required for commercial products",2010
Study on cement mortar and concrete made with sewage sludge ash,construction materials; resource; thermal power sludge ash,,"This study investigated the feasibility of reusing wastewater sludge ash in construction materials to replace partial materials Wastewater sludge sampled from thermal power plant was burned into sludge ash at 800 degrees C in the laboratory The sludge incineration ash has low heavy metal including Pb, Cd, Cr and Cu, so it belongs to general enterprise waste The chemical composition of sludge incineration ash was summed up in SiO(2), CaO, Fe(2)O(3) and MgO Then the wastewater sludge ash is also found to be a porous material with irregular surface When the sludge ash was used to replace mortar or concrete cement, its water-adsorption capability will result in the reduction of mortar workability and compressive strength Cement is being substituted for sludge ash, and 10 percent of sludge ash is more appropriate Sludge ash is reused to take the place of construction materials and satisfies the requests of standard specification except for higher water absorption",2010
A field survey of the causes of lining cracks in irrigation channels of Shadegan network,Crack; geotechnical conditions; irrigation channel; lining,,"In order to investigate the causes of deterioration of concrete channels of Shadegan irrigation network, first preliminary studies, data collection and field observations were conducted then the damaged points were identified and these points were individually characterized and sampled accordingly. Tests were carried out to determine characteristics such as grain size, density, etc., while chemical tests such as soluble salts, pH, etc. and mechanical test like swelling test by consolidation device were conducted, By analyzing the field and laboratory data obtained and combining them one can conclude that the most affecting causes in damaging the Shadegan irrigation network in short term are geotechnical conditions of the channel embankment such as swelling and existence of salt materials such as gypsum. Other causes such as soil divergence, inefficient project execution, low-quality construction materials and unsuitable operation maintenance strategies can devastate the concrete cover of the channels.",2009
Experimental Study of PCM Inclusion in Different Building Envelopes,brick; building management systems; concrete; heat pumps; HVAC; phase change materials; power conversion,PHASE-CHANGE MATERIAL; THERMAL-ENERGY STORAGE; SIMULATION; WALLS; ART,"The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate experimentally that it is possible to improve the thermal comfort and reduce the energy consumption of a building without substantial increase in the weight of the construction materials with the inclusion of phase change materials (PCM). PCM are a suitable and promising technology for this application. This paper presents an experimental setup to test PCM with various typical insulation and construction materials in real conditions in Puigverd de Lleida (Lleida, Spain). Nine small house-sized cubicles were constructed: two with concrete, five with conventional brick, and two with alveolar brick. PCM was added in one cubicle of each typology. For each type of construction specific experiments were done. In all cubicles, free-floating temperature experiments were performed to determine the benefits of using PCM. A Trombe wall was added in both concrete cubicles and its influence was investigated. All brick cubicles were equipped with domestic heat pumps as Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system; therefore, the energy consumption was registered, providing real information about the energy savings. Results were very good for the concrete cubicles, since temperature oscillation were reduced by up to 4 degrees C through the use of PCM and also peak temperatures in the PCM cubicle were shifted in later hours. In the brick cubicles, the energy consumption of the HVAC system in summer was reduced by using PCM for set points higher than 20 degrees C. During winter an insulation effect of the PCM is observed, keeping the temperatures of the cubicles warmer, especially during the cold hours of the day.",2009
The evolution of Sagrada Familia construction,Gaudi; Sagrada Familia; construction; evolution; materials,,"Despite its unfinished state, the Temple of the Holy Family, or Sagrada Familia, is Antoni Gaudi's most widely recognized work and one of the most important milestones in the development of Catalan Modernism. This article follows and describes the evolution of the construction of the temple, highlighting the challenges which it has faced when searching for viable constructive solutions for Caudi's architecture. Throughout history the construction materials have been adapted to the needs of each of the elements which had to be built. Although, at the end of s. XIX, Gaudi built mostly in traditional masonry, he spent years studying the rest of the Temple and the different materials that could be built. This text continues to describe as collaborators of Gaudi's work could continue the construction after his death and how, in recent years, recent advances in constructive processes and materials have been introduced in the Temple.

"Long-term environmental impact of coral mining at the Wakatobi marine park, Indonesia",,REEFS; MANAGEMENT; TANZANIA; MALDIVES,"Coral mining for use as construction material is a major cause of reef degradation in several coastal nations. We studied the long-term impact of coral mining at the Wakatobi marine park, Indonesia, where a substantial mining event was undertaken two decades ago in order to supply building material for a jetty. The mined area shows significant differences in reef viability compared to a control reef 1000 m away: the percentage of dead coral in the substrate, the percentage of live coral coverage, the species richness and abundance of hard corals are all greatly reduced. For the most part, soft corals and other (non-coral) invertebrates do not show significant differences in richness, abundance or diversity, but their species composition differs greatly: the control site abounds giant clams, whereas these are absent at the mined site; instead, the dominant species there is Strombus, an algae-grazing gastropod associated with stressed reefs. We conclude that the mined reef flat failed to recover from the severe mining event, despite being un-mined for over 20 years. Our results demonstrate that without effective management and enforcement, coral mining may cause a long-term, destructive impact on the coral reef ecosystem. We propose the following management steps: first, law enforcement measures must become more stringent: second, alternative income sources such as aquaculture, ecotourism, or even land-based alternatives need to be actively promoted and financed; third, alternative building materials such as landrock and concrete should become more accessible and affordable; and fourth, education and awareness regarding both the MPA regulations and the environmental impact of coral mining have to be strengthened.

Prediction of the compressive strength of vacuum processed concretes using artificial neural network and regression techniques,Artificial neural network; vacuum processed concrete; nondestructive testing; statistical analysis,FLY-ASH,"Concrete which is a composite material is one of the most important construction materials. For the improvement of concrete quality some advanced technologies are used for curing and placement of concrete. Vacuum processing is one of these technologies. With the vacuum application, water content of the mixture is decreased and by this way a better water/cement ratio is obtained. Since most of the empirical equations which use nondestructive test results are developed for normal concretes, their prediction performance for vacuum processed concrete is unclear. In this study regression equations and an artificial neural network (ANN) were developed for the estimation of compressive strength of vacuum processed concrete. For the experimental set up, three different concretes were prepared by applying variable vacuum application duration. On these concrete samples, Windsor probe penetration tests, Schmidt hammer tests, pulse velocity determination tests, were performed. In addition to these; densities, void ratios, water absorption values and capillary water absorption values of extracted core samples were determined. Several equations using single independent variables for the estimation of compressive strength were developed, a multi linear regression equation which uses Windsor probe exposed length, pulse velocity, density and water absorption ratio as predictor variables was developed. A neural network was developed for the estimation of compressive strength. Finally prediction performances of previously published empirical equations, single and multiple variable regression equations developed during this study and ANN were compared. According to this comparison, best prediction performance belongs to ANN.",2009

The particleboard specimens with waste tire rubber were not generally resistant against four fungi tested. Only MUF-containing specimens showed considerably better performance in decay resistance tests using the brown-rot fungus, Postia placenta; however, addition of waste tire rubber into those specimens did not provide resistance in comparison with control specimens without tire rubber.

THE ENGINEERING PROPERTIES OF FIRED BRICK INCORPORATING TEXTILE WASTE ASH AND BASALTIC PUMICE,Fired brick; waste ash; basaltic pumice; ultrasonic sound; microstructure,FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; STRENGTH,"Main objective of this study is to use side product of waste ash of textile factory, which also causes environmental pollution, in the production of high strength clay bricks. Beside waste ash, basaltic pumice, which includes high amount of silica and are readily available in our country, used as an additive material in the production of high-strength clay bricks. Turkey has very rich basaltic pumice reserve in various regions and most of them have not been used efficiently. One of the reasons of this is that domestic consumption areas of the basaltic pumice and the amount of usage in these areas have been very low. With this study, consumption of the basaltic pumice in Turkey will be increased by its use in the production of construction materials. So, waste ash and basaltic pumice will have economical value due to their use in construction materials. Basaltic pumice and clay are also readily available in the same region. Chemical and mechanical characteristics of the obtained materials were determined, Clay bricks with/without waste ash and basaltic pumice were produced. Moreover, behavior of clay bricks in different environments were also determined experimentally. Each sample was fired at 700, 900 and 1050 degrees C for 8 h. The bulk density, harmful magnesia and lime, shrinkage, water absorption, compressive and flexural strength, ultrasonic sound velocity and Scanning Electron Microscopy tests were carried out. The test results were compared with the standard values and they were found to be satisfactory. Finally, it was concluded that both waste ash and basaltic pumice were suitable additions and could be used efficiently in fired brick production at 900 degrees C.",2009
Electrical resistance of carbon-nanofiber concrete,,NANO-PARTICLES; SHORT FIBERS; CEMENT; MATRIX,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material, and carbon nanofibers have many advantages in both mechanical and electrical properties such as high strength, high Young's modulus and high conductivity. In this paper, the mechanical and electrical properties of concrete containing carbon nanofibers (CNF) are experimentally studied. The test results indicate that the compressive strength and per cent reduction in electrical resistance while loading concrete containing CNF are much greater than those of plain concrete. Finally, a reasonable concentration of CNF is obtained for use in concrete which not only enhances compressive strength, but also improves the electrical properties required for strain monitoring, damage evaluation and self-health monitoring of concrete.",2009
Pakistani bentonite in mortars and concrete as low cost construction material,Ordinary Portland cement; Bentonite; Mortar; Concrete; Mechanical properties,FLY-ASH; STRENGTH; POZZOLANS,"A Pakistani bentonite, in ""as is"" (21 degrees C) and ""heated"" (150 degrees C, 250 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 750 degrees C and 950 degrees C) conditions, was incorporated in mortar cubes, concrete cylinders and concrete beams as a partial substitute for Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and studied in detail. Results showed that OPC mortars and concrete containing 20% ""as is"" and 25% ""heated to 150 degrees C"" bentonite could be used as low-cost construction materials. They will also reduce energy consumption, preserve natural resources and solve environmental problems related to cement production as well as augment the durability and life cycle of the concrete structures. The X-ray diffraction patterns showed that bentonite possessed both crystalline and amorphous phases. The strength activity indices (SAI) after 7 and 28 days were higher than 75% for ""as is"" and ""heated"" bentonite, except for the 950 degrees C samples, which was below the ASTM C618 specified limit of 75%. The maximum SAI was shown by ""150 degrees C heated"" bentonite. The compressive strength data also showed similar results for OPC mortar cubes and concrete cylinders containing ""150 degrees C heated"" bentonite. When compared with the control mixture, the compressive strength values were the same as for mortar containing 25% bentonite as replacement of OPC. However, these values decreased in concrete initially and started to gain strength remarkably after 28 days. Resistance to sulphate attack and water absorption tests on mortar cubes soaked in 2% magnesium sulphate and 5% sodium sulphate solutions demonstrated consistent improvement as the bentonite content in them was increased. The modulus of rupture of all concrete beams decreased as the OPC substitution level by bentonite increased from 20% to 40%. Bond strength of OPC mortar containing 20% ""as is"" and 25% ""heated to 150 degrees C"" bentonite in brick prisms was almost the same as that of control mixture. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Influence of mineral additions on the performance of 100% recycled aggregate concrete,Durability; Fine recycled aggregate; Fly ash; Pull-out strength; Shrinkage; Recycled aggregate; Supplementary cementing materials; Sustainability,2-STAGE MIXING APPROACH; FLY-ASH; CEMENT; STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR,"A judicious use of resources, by using by-products and waste materials, and a lower environmental impact, by reducing carbon dioxide emission and virgin aggregate extraction, allow to approach sustainable building development. Recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) containing supplementary cementitious materials (SCM), if satisfactory concrete properties are achieved, can be an example of such sustainable construction materials. In this work concrete specimens were manufactured by completely replacing fine and coarse aggregates with recycled aggregates from a rubble recycling plant. Also RAC with fly ash (RA + FA) or silica fume (RA + SF) were studied. Concrete properties were evaluated by means of compressive strength and modulus of elasticity in the first experimental part. In the second experimental part, compressive and tensile splitting strength, dynamic modulus of elasticity, drying shrinkage, reinforcing bond strength, carbonation, chloride penetration were studied. Satisfactory concrete properties can be developed with recycled fine and coarse aggregates with proper selection and proportioning of the concrete materials. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanistic analysis of ST and SBS-modified flexible pavements,Styrene-butadiene-styrene; Starch; Anisotropic; Pavement design,ASPHALT CONCRETE; MIXTURES; BEHAVIOR; POLYETHYLENE; ANISOTROPY; SAND,"This paper deals with the viability of using starch (ST) and styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) as an additive in stone matrix asphalt (SMA) mixtures. A 5% of ST and SBS by weight of bitumen were blended with (70/100)-paving grade asphalt. Unmodified and modified bitumen were Subjected to physiochemical tests. The performance tests including, Marshall stability, tensile strength, tensile strength ratio and resilient modulus were carried out on unmodified and modified SMA mixtures. A mechanistic-empirical design approach was used for estimating the improvement in service life of the pavement or reduction in thickness of SMA and base layer for the same service life due to modification the SMA mixtures. The analyses of test results show that the moisture damage and temperature susceptibility can be reduced by the inclusion of ST and SBS in the asphalt mixture. The results also revealed that ST-modifier can be used as anti-stripping agent, and reduced plant emissions and energy consumption by 30%, as well as it shows resistant to fuels, most common chemicals and solvents. The results of multi-layer elastic analysis presented herein indicate that the pavement consisting of ST and SBS-modified SMA as a surface layer is beneficial in reducing the construction materials. In addition, the safe pavement design criteria of unmodified and modified SMA mixtures based on the anisotropic elasticity analysis through finite-element simulation were obtained and reported herein.

Mechanical and microstructural characterization of an alkali-activated slag/limestone fine aggregate concrete,Slag; Alkali-activated cement; Environment; C-S-H,BLAST-FURNACE SLAG; CALCIUM SILICATE HYDRATE; CEMENT PASTES; PRODUCTS; STRENGTH; MORTARS; MICROANALYSIS; GEOPOLYMER; METAL,"Four limestone-based, alkali-activated slag fine aggregate concretes, two of which contained amorphous silica in the form of diatomaceous earth, were fabricated using different activating solutions (NaOH/waterglass or Na(2)CO(3)). Emphasis in this work was placed on using simple manufacturing methods and widely available materials, to ensure that these formulae are practical as construction materials in the developing world. Although cured only at room temperature, these fine aggregate concretes have good compressive strengths (similar to 45 MPa) and their tensile strengths increased from similar to 2.6 MPa after I day of curing to similar to 4 MPa after 28 day for the NaOH-activated formulae. Samples activated with Na(2)CO(3) had negligible tensile strengths after I day, increasing to similar to 2.5 MPa after 28 day. The main cementing phase was shown to be calcium-silicate-hydrates in all formulae; those activated with Na(2)CO(3) also showed the presence of hydrotalcite. No evidence of geopolymeric phases was found, though incorporation of Na to form N-S-H that balance charges arising from Al substitution of Si in C-S-H is likely. Despite the short (similar to 120s) pot life of the strongest formula, NaCl was shown to be an effective retarding agent, which reduced the strengths of different formulae, at worst, by less than 25% after 28 day of curing.

Retained properties of concrete exposed to high temperatures: Size effect,concrete; fire; high temperatures; strength; UPV; rebound number; SEM,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; ELEVATED-TEMPERATURES; FIRE; BEHAVIOR; DAMAGE; MODEL,"Concrete as a construction material is likely exposed to high temperatures during fire. The retained properties of concrete after such exposures are still of great importance in terms of the serviceability of structures. This paper presents the effects of high temperatures on the physical, mechanical, and microstructural properties of concrete. Specimens with different sizes were exposed to high temperatures ranging from 200 to 1200 degrees C. The compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and rebound numbers of the specimens were determined. The microstructures of the specimens were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses. The test results indicated that the retained compressive strength of concrete considerably decreased with increase in temperature. The effect of specimen size on the retained compressive strength was not pronounced. The retained splitting tensile strength of concrete remarkably reduced as the temperature was increased. The specimen size played an important role on the retained splitting tensile strength of concrete up to 400 degrees C. The test results revealed that ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) test can be successfully used in order to check the uniformity of fire-damaged structures. The rebound numbers decreased with increase in exposure temperature. SEM studies on specimens exposed to 800 degrees C revealed significant changes in the microstructure of the concrete.

"Mobility of trace metals associated with urban particles exposed to natural waters of various salinities from the Gironde Estuary, France",Bulk deposition; Desorption; Garonne River; Road dust; Salinity gradient; Urban particulate metals,GARONNE RIVER SYSTEM; HEAVY-METALS; LAND-USE; SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA; STREET SEDIMENTS; DISSOLVED MOLYBDENUM; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; GEOCHEMICAL SIGNALS; SEASONAL-VARIATIONS; COASTAL SEDIMENTS,"Urban systems are hot spots of environmental pollution caused by manifold anthropogenic activities generating traffic-related, industrial and domestic emissions. Besides air, soil and groundwater pollution, pollution of surface water systems is of major concern because they are often (ab)used to export waste of various consistence out of urban areas and become contaminated on varying scales. The Gironde Estuary (southwest France) is affected by various anthropogenic contaminations derived from historic polymetallic pollution mainly due to former mining and ore-treatment and, additionally, from agriculture and urban areas. Although detailed knowledge is available on the impact of mining and anthropogenic activities on the water quality of the Gironde Estuary, almost nothing is known on the urban impact, even though the Garonne Branch which is one tributary of the Gironde system crosses the large urban agglomeration of Bordeaux. The present work links urban geochemistry and estuary research and aims at evaluating the mobility of potentially toxic trace elements (Cd, Cu, Zn, V, Co, Mo, Pb) associated with urban particles under estuarine conditions owing to the particles' role as potential vectors transporting urban pollutants into the estuary. For this, environmentally available fractions of trace elements in representative urban particles (urban dust, road sediment, riverbank sediment, construction materials) from the city of Bordeaux were extracted by natural estuarine waters of varying salinities and compared to commonly applied HNO(3) extractions. For the assessment of the urban particles' contribution to the pollution of the Gironde/Garonne system, various particle types were sampled in Bordeaux: road sediments, urban bulk deposition, construction materials (concrete, asphalt, tile and gravel) and flood sediments. Potentially environmental available fractions of Cd, Cu, Zn, V, Co, Mo and Pb were extracted by means of concentrated HNO(3), estuarine freshwaters and waters of two different salinities (S = 15 and S = 31). Analysis of trace elements was carried out by means of quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, single particles from road sediments were characterised with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM analysis clearly showed that some particles contained fairly high concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements. Extractions of materials investigated by varying acidities and salinities documented that the potentially bioavailable fractions extracted by concentrated HNO(3) may cover wide concentration ranges. Natural estuarine waters of various salinities (S = 0.5; S = 15; S = 31) extracted high proportions of Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd from urban particles, especially for high-salinity water (S = 31). Extractions with freshwater revealed the lowest concentrations of desorbed trace elements. Particulate Mo, Pb and V showed similar or lower mobility in saline water compared with freshwater, depending on the sample type. Trace element mobility in estuarine waters varied according to the type of urban particles and depended on salinity for Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd. This is of high importance for towns located directly at the coast or for cities like Bordeaux, where water courses crossing the agglomerations are connected to saline water masses. Since trace elements desorbed from particles in saline waters may become highly bioavailable, they bear a potential risk for organisms. Comprehensive studies on the behaviour of urban particles in estuarine waters and the related potential environmental impact are still missing. Saline waters mobilise relatively high amounts of Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd from urban particles suggesting considerable metal fluxes from riverine urban systems into coastal waters. Although estimates of trace metal inputs by urban bulk deposition (urban dust) and other types of urban particles are preliminary for Bordeaux and may bear important uncertainties due to several assumptions and extrapolation to the annual timescale, the orders of magnitude are probably realistic. Thus, these fluxes are not negligible and need (1) further and improved observation and (2) to be taken into account in both mass budgets at the estuary scale and emission control strategies. New approaches combining geochemical and mineralogical characterisation of single urban particle types help identify their role in metal emission into the environment and develop potential limitation strategies (e.g. the ban of priority pollutants in tyres, etc.). Therefore, prioritisation of urban particle sources in terms of fluxes, reactivity of associated pollutants and feasibility of emission reduction is strongly recommended. Coastal cities should integrate extractions of urban particles with saline water into their environmental monitoring programs owing to the fact that saline conditions might cause efficient desorption of potentially toxic trace elements. In continental cities, winter salting is likely to induce intense mobilisation of metals from road sediments that may then reach the aquatic environment, instead of being retained in runoff decantation reservoirs followed by subsequent disposal/treatment with road sediments. However, also particles from continental cities reach coastal waters via rivers and have to be assessed with respect to trace metal desorption under various salinities. There is a strong need for the quantification of fluxes and for the identification of carrier phases and reactivity of metals exported from urban areas to aquatic systems.",2009
The correlation dimension: A robust chaotic feature for classifying acoustic emission signals generated in construction materials,,STRANGE ATTRACTORS; MUTUAL INFORMATION; CONCRETE; CLASSIFICATION; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS,"In the field of acoustic emission (AE) source recognition, this paper presents a classification feature based on the paradigm of nonlinear dynamical systems, often referred to as chaos theory. The approach considers signals as time series expressing an underlying dynamical phenomenon and enclosing all the information regarding the dynamics. The scientific knowledge on nonlinear dynamical systems has considerably improved for the past 40 years. The dynamical behavior is analyzed in the phase space, which is the space generated by the state variables of the system. The time evolution of a system is expressed in the phase space by trajectories, and the asymptotic behavior of trajectories defines a space area which is referred to as a system attractor. Dynamical systems may be characterized by the topological properties of attractors, such as the correlation dimension, which is a fractal dimension. According to Takens theorem, even if the system is not clearly defined, it is possible to infer topological information about the attractor from experimental observations. Such a method, which is called phase space reconstruction, was successfully applied for the classification of acoustic emission waveforms propagating in more or less complex materials such as granite and concrete. Laboratory tests were carried out in order to collect numerous AE waveforms from various controlled acoustic sources. Then, each signal was processed to extract a reconstructed attractor from which the correlation dimension was computed. The first results of this research show that the correlation dimension assessed after phase space reconstruction is very relevant and robust for classifying AE signals. These promising results may be explained by the fact that the totality of the signal is used to achieve classifying information. Moreover, due to the self-similar nature of attractors, the correlation dimension, and thus a correlation dimension-based classification approach, is theoretically insensitive to signal absorption.

CONSTRUCTION RESOURCE USE OF TWO DIFFERENT TYPES AND SCALES OF IOWA SWINE PRODUCTION FACILITIES,Building materials; Construction costs; Hoop barn; Swine production,,"As global populations and affluence rise, there is increasing demand for energy, animal protein, and construction materials. In many cases, available resource pools are insufficient to meet growing market demands, resulting in increased prices and competition for limited resources. This study evaluates key construction resources needed to build different types and scales of Iowa swine production facilities. Two types of facilities - conventional confinement and hoop barn-based within farrow-to-finish pig production systems scaled to produce either 5,200 or 15,600 market pigs annually arc, examined. Conventional confinement facilities are typical of pork industry practice in the United States and are characterized by individual gestation stalls and 1,200 head grow-finish buildings with slatted concrete floors and liquid manure systems. The hoop barn-based alternative uses bedded group pens in hoop barns for gestation and finishing. Five building materials: concrete, steel, lumber, thermoplastics, insulation, as well as crushed rock and diesel fuel used for building site preparation are considered. Land surface area required for buildings and pig production infrastructure are also compared. Relative market costs of newly constructed swine facilities are compared under several material price scenarios. Using hoop barns for grow-finish and gestation results in lower construction costs. Increasing the scale of pig production results in lower construction costs per pig space, however the construction costs per pig space for a 5,200 head hoop barn-based complex is less than the construction costs per pig space for a 15,600 head conventional confinement system. lit terms of construction resource use and cost, hoop barns for swine are a viable alternative that are less dependent on the scale of production than conventional confinement facilities.",2009
Timber-concrete composite structures: a rational technique for bridges of vicinal roads,structural system; connection system; horizontal shear; durability; composite panel,LONG-TERM; BEAMS; PERFORMANCE; CONNECTION; BEHAVIOR; JOINTS; SHEAR,"In general, the rational application of construction materials requires the development or improvement of building techniques. Thus, the use of concrete and timber, traditional materials largely accepted in rural buildings, making composite structures, constitutes a possible solution for presenting adequate structural and economical performances and durability too. In particular, the effectiveness of this structural system must be assured by a connection at the interface of the materials, and it can be of discrete (metallic elements: screws, steel bars, nails etc) or continuous types (epoxy adhesive). Several kinds of civil construction applications can be contemplated by this structural system, as in restorations or construction of new bridges. In fact, along the vicinal roads, there is a large number of timber bridges that need restorations and there is a need to construct new bridges as well. General speaking, bridges are exposed to severe weather and loading conditions, and, thus, they must be carefully studied, so that the connection mechanisms can be more precisely evaluated, as well as the composite structure behavior during its entire life. In this context, by analyzing the several aspects that involve the performance of the timber-concrete composite structures and, also the mechanical behavior of the connections in these structures, we conclude, in this article, that this construction technique is feasible for bridges in vicinal roads. Further, additional research on the long-term loading effects, temperature and moisture variations, is necessary to improve the simulation models.",2009
A novel aggregate classification technique using moment invariants and cascaded multilayered perceptron network,Aggregate classification; Pattern classification; Moment invariants; Image processing; Discriminant analysis; Cascaded multilayered perceptron (c-MLP) network; Artificial neural network,PATTERN-RECOGNITION; COARSE AGGREGATE,"Occupying more than 70% of the concrete's volume, aggregates play a vital role as the raw feed for construction materials; particularly in the production of concrete and concrete products. Often, the characteristics such as shape, size and surface texture of aggregates significantly affect the quality of the construction materials produced. This article discusses a novel method for automatic classification of aggregate shapes using moment invariants and artificial neural networks. In the processing stage, Hu, Zernike and Affine moments are used to extract features from binary boundary and area images. in the feature selection stage. discriminant analysis is employed to select the optimum features for the aggregate shape classification. In the classification stage, a cascaded multilayered perceptron (c-MLP) network is proposed to categorize the aggregate into six shapes. The c-MLP network consists of three MLPs which are arranged in a serial combination and trained with the same learning algorithm. The proposed method has been tested and compared with twelve machine learning algorithms namely Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno quasi-newton (BFG), Resilient back propagation (RP), Scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), Conjugate gradient with Powell-Beale restarts (CGB), Conjugate gradient with Fletcher-Reeves updates (CGF), Conjugate gradient with Polak-Ribiere updates (CGP), One step secant (OSS), Bayesian regularization (BR), Gradient descent (GD), Gradient descent with momentum and adaptive learning rate (GDX) and Gradient descent with momentum (GDM) algorithms. Also, the classification performance of the c-MLP network is compared with those of the hybrid multilayered perceptron (HMLP), the radial basis function (RBF) as well as discriminant analysis classifiers. Concerning the cascaded MLP, 3 stage c-MLP gives the best accuracy compared to the 2 stage c-MLP and the standard MLP. Compared to other learning algorithms, LM algorithm achieved the best result. As far as the overall conclusion is concerned, cMLP gives better classification performance than that of the HMLP, RBF and discriminant analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2009
Analysis of geopolymer concrete columns,Column; Geopolymer concrete; Fly ash; Stress-strain relationship,ENGINEERING PROPERTIES,"Ordinary portland cement (OPC) has been traditionally used as the binding agent in concrete. However, it is also necessary to search for alternative low-emission binding agents for concrete to reduce the environmental impact caused by manufacturing of cement. Geopolymer, also known as inorganic polymer, is one such material that uses by-product material such as fly ash instead of cement. Recent research has shown that fly ash-based geopolymer concrete has suitable properties for its use as a construction material. Since the strength development mechanism of geopolymer is different from that of OPC binder, it is necessary to obtain a suitable constitutive model for geopolymer concrete to predict the load-deflection behaviour and strength of geopolymer concrete structural members. This article has investigated the suitability of using an existing stress-strain model originally proposed by Popovics for OPC concrete. It is found that the equation of Popovics can be used for geopolymer concrete with minor modification to the expression for the curve fitting factor, to better fit with the post-peak parts of the experimental stress-strain curves. The slightly modified set of stress-strain equations was then used in a non-linear analysis for reinforced concrete columns. A good correlation is achieved between the predicted and measured ultimate loads, load-deflection curves and deflected shapes for 12 slender test columns.",2009

SUSTAINABLE MEDIUM-STRENGTH CONCRETE (CS-CONCRETE) FROM COLLIERY SPOIL IN SOUTH WALES UK,coal; mining; waste; colliery; stabilization; wastepaper; sludge; ash,PAVING BLOCKS; AGGREGATE; SLUDGE,"This paper reviews one way in which colliery spoil can be utilized in low-strength concrete. Colliery Spoil (CS) (minestone), a by-product of coal mining, is abundant in most parts of the world. It has potential as a construction material but it has not been fully appreciated. This is partly because colliery spoil is not easy to utilize, due a number of drawbacks. The major problems identified in attempts to utilize CS in construction include excessive wear, expansive behaviour, leaching of heavy metals and even radioactivity. Thus, to date, the bulk of the CS utilization is limited to isolated cases of highway embankments, backfilling of mines, quarries and other surface tips, or in extreme cases subjected to marine and other disposal. This paper reports on the scope of technological benefits of utilizing colliery spoil (CS) in low to medium strength concrete. There has been intermittent pursuance of the benefits of utilizing colliery spoil in the United Kingdom. However, there is still no well-accepted and/or positive feedback on any colliery-based technology and/or construction material, apart from that relating its use for bulk fill. This research was triggered by proximity of large supplies of both CS and stag in South Wales, UK, as well as the authors' interest in advances in sustainable construction. Two fractions of colliery spoil were mixed in equal proportions and used for concrete where the binder was PC, or novel binders comprising of either Wastepaper Sludge Ash (WSA) or WSA combined in equal proportions with Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), themselves industrial wastes or by-product materials. Compressive strength of compacted cube specimens was monitored for a period of up to 56 days of curing. Results indicate that the performance of systems incorporating CS and WSA were of very poor workability, but the resultant strength was within the low to medium category usable for blinding concrete and or for use in bound granular fill or foundations.",2009
USING DURABILITY TO ENHANCE CONCRETE SUSTAINABILITY,,,"The sustainability of concrete buildings and infrastructure must be considered both in terms of its benefits to society and the environmental impact associated with its use in construction. Production of Portland cement (PC), in particular, is energy intensive and generates a significant amount of carbon dioxide. Cement is, however, only a relatively small component of concrete and overall the material is resource efficient and has moderate embodied energy and carbon dioxide footprint. Concrete is widely used due to its low cost, ease Of use, good track record, versatility, local availability, thermal benefits, acoustic dampening, and durability. Durability performance of construction materials is important, and concrete is often considered to be inherently durable due to its chemical and physical resistance to various environments and dimensional stability. Concrete structures are assumed to be largely maintenance-free and to provide long service lives. Figure 1 shows an 80-year-old concrete bridge in South Africa that is still providing good performance under severe weather conditions. This assumption is not true in all environments and service conditions unless special attention is given to ensuring a high level of durability performance. With an understanding of concrete microstructure and potential deterioration mechanisms, it is possible to engineer almost any level of durability performance. In creasing the service life of buildings and infrastructure through improved durability has clear advantages in terms of optimizing resources and reducing waste, thus enhancing efficiency. Other advantages associated with improved durability that enhance the sustainability of concrete include improved structural performance, reduced labour, and improved understanding of concrete materials, which will assist in development of new technologies.",2009
The contemporary cement cycle of the United States,Material flow analysis; Cement; Construction and demolition waste; United States; Sustainable infrastructure,REINFORCED POLYMER COMPOSITES; MULTILEVEL CYCLE; DEMOLITION WASTE; CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE; COPPER,"A country-level stock and flow model for cement, an important construction material, was developed based on a material flow analysis framework. Using this model, the contemporary cement cycle of the United States was constructed by analyzing production, import, and export data for different stages of the cement cycle. The United States currently supplies approximately 80% of its cement consumption through domestic production and the rest is imported. The average annual net addition of in-use new cement stock over the period 2000-2004 was approximately 83 million metric tons and amounts to 2.3 tons per capita of concrete. Nonfuel carbon dioxide emissions (42 million metric tons per year) from the calcination phase of cement manufacture account for 62% of the total 68 million tons per year of cement production residues. The end-of-life cement discards are estimated to be 33 million metric tons per year, of which between 30% and 80% is recycled. A significant portion of the infrastructure in the United States is reaching the end of its useful life and will need to be replaced or rehabilitated; this could require far more cement than might be expected from economic forecasts of demand for cement.",2009
FLY ASH AS THE POTENTIAL RAW MIXTURE COMPONENT FOR PORTLAND CEMENT CLINKER SYNTHESIS,characterization; fly ash; thermal properties,CONCRETE; MORTAR,"This paper presents the results of investigation of properties of fly ash from four major thermal power plants in Serbia.

This paper examines the current worldwide situation regarding cement manufacture and consumption and examines various options for future development and replacement of cement. It is concluded that while a number of technical replacements for Portland cement are already possible, there are still some major challenges for most of the innovative cements currently being developed. It is thus likely that Portland cements, albeit with significantly reduced clinker contents, will still dominate the world construction market for the foreseeable future.",2009
Possibility of using waste tire rubber and fly ash with Portland cement as construction materials,,TYRE RUBBER; CONCRETE; PERFORMANCE,"The growing amount of waste rubber produced from used tires has resulted in an environmental problem. Recycling waste tires has been widely studied for the last 20 years in applications such as asphalt pavement, waterproofing systems and membrane liners. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and rubber waste with Portland cement as a composite material for masonry applications. Class C fly ash and waste automobile tires in three different sizes were used with Portland cement. Compressive and flexural strength, dry unit weight and water absorption tests were performed on the composite specimens containing waste tire rubber. The compressive strength decreased by increasing the rubber content while increased by increasing the fly ash content for all curing periods. This trend is slightly influenced by particle size. For flexural strength, the specimens with waste tire rubber showed higher values than the control mix probably due to the effect of rubber fibers. The dry unit weight of all specimens decreased with increasing rubber content, which can be explained by the low specific gravity of rubber particles. Water absorption decreased slightly with the increase in rubber particles size. These composite materials containing 10% Portland cement, 70% and 60% fly ash and 20% and 30% tire rubber particles have sufficient strength for masonry applications. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Application of the Sharp Front Model to capillary absorption in a vuggy limestone,Vuggy limestone; Transport properties; Microstructure; Pore size distribution; Capillary absorption,POROUS BUILDING-MATERIALS; WATER-MOVEMENT; UNSATURATED FLOW; SORPTIVITY; CONCRETE; LAYERS; BRICK,"The unusual pore size distribution and in particular the presence of large pores in certain construction materials, results in an anomalous sorptivity and a marked deviation from the standard t(1/2) law. In this paper, we report the results of water and ethanol uptake tests carried out in order to investigate the imbibition behaviour of a vuggy limestone. The experimental data confirm that capillary absorption into a natural building stone with bimodal pore size distribution does not obey simple t(1/2) kinetics. Sharp Front (SF) analysis is therefore used to model the liquid transport properties of this material as a linear combination of absorption into the coarse pores and into the finer matrix pores. The results of the analysis indicate that the overall capillary absorption into a vuggy limestone may be described reasonably well as the sum of two processes: a capillary absorption into the large pores with the low capillary suction, which does not follow the classical t(1/2) behaviour; and a slow capillary absorption into the fine pores which obeys the standard t(1/2) law. We also note that water matrix sorptivity is almost 50% lower than expected for a simple complete-wetting capillary scaling. This is an example of a water sorptivity anomaly in natural building stones which is attributed to incomplete wetting. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2009

Mechanistic approach for polypropylene-modified flexible pavements,Polypropylene; Stone matrix asphalt; Flexible pavements,,"The present study investigates the benefits of modifying the asphalt and stone matrix asphalt (SMA) mixture in flexible pavement. Fifty/sixty penetration grade asphalt cement and four proportion of pyrolisis polypropylene (PP) were selected. Unmodified and modified asphalt binders were subjected to rheological and homogeneity tests. The performance tests including, Marshall stability, tensile strength and compressive strength were conducted on unmodified and modified SMA mixtures. The regression relationships between the performance tests were obtained. A mechanistic-empirical design approach was used for estimating the improvement in service life of the pavement or reduction in thickness of SMA and base layer for the same service life due to modification the SMA mixtures. The analyses of test results show that the performance of PP-modified asphalt mixtures are better when compared to conventional mixtures. The temperature Susceptibility can be reduced by the inclusion of PP in the asphalt mixture. A PP content of 5% by weight of asphalt is recommended for the improvement of the performance of asphalt concrete mixtures similar to that investigated in this study. The results of multi-layer elastic analysis presented herein indicate that the pavement consisting of PP-modified SMA as a surface layer is beneficial in reducing the construction materials. Actual savings would depend upon the option exercised by the designer for reducing the thickness of an individual layer. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2009
Measurement of radon emanation in construction materials,Radon emanation; Construction materials,,"Due to the new proposed Israeli approach for radioactivity in construction materials (IS 5098) issued in 2007, the radon emanation of a construction material, a brick in the form of a box (a rectangular parallelepiped), should be checked when its four faces are insulated in order to achieve the same simulation effect when a concrete block is embedded into a wall. A physical model was developed in order to measure the insulation level (quality) of a building product (bulk concrete, building block, tiles, etc.) when its four sides are insulated by various materials. Under the experimental conditions it was found that the insulation level for bulk concrete was 99.5 +/- 0.04% which is in good agreement with the requirement of the new Israeli Standard IS 5098. The influence of aging of concrete materials on radon emanation and the emanation ratio, deduced from measurements of insulated and non-insulated materials, was investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Low-temperature electrolysis of aluminum in a bath made of corundum high-alumina concrete,aluminum electrolysis; potassium cryolite; high-alumina concrete; construction materials; corrosion,ANODES; SYSTEM,"Low-cement high-alumina corundum concrete is tested as a lining material for the electrolysis of aluminum from the KF-AlF(3)-Al(2)O(3) melt at 750A degrees C. From the results of a 100-h experiment, it was revealed that the process is stable with a rather high current efficiency. Concrete lining did not corrode during this time. The material under investigation does not significantly affect the quality of the obtained metal. Based on the results of a chemical analysis of the cathode metal before and after the experiments, the calcium and potassium content satisfies the requirements of GOST (State Standard) 11069-2001 for technically pure primary aluminum. The investigated high-alumina concrete can be suggested as a lining material in the design of an aluminum electrolyzer bath with a low-temperature potassium-containing electrolyte.",2009
A new technique of processing for waste-expanded polystyrene foams as aggregates,Waste recycling process; Modified polymer foams; Environment,CONCRETE; EPS; CEMENT,"In daily life, expanded polystyrene foams (EPS) are widely used as packaging material, construction material, and in household appliances as well as many others. On the other hand, waste EPS has caused lots of environmental pollutions because it cannot be decomposed in nature. Utilization of waste EPS in concrete technology is more common. In this study, a new recycling process developed of the waste EPS foams by using heat treatment. Its characters and process are described in this paper, as well as its experimental system. This technique reduces the volume of waste EPS about 20 times of the original. Before the heat treatment, the average density, thermal conductivity and compressive strength of waste EPS foams were 10 kg/m(3), 0.0368 W/mK, and 0.12 MPa, respectively. The best result of modification was determined at 130 degrees C and 15 min. After the modification, density, thermal conductivity and compressive strength of waste EPS, increased to 217 kg/m(3), 0.0555 W/mK and 8.29 MPa, respectively. This new material, which is obtained after the heat treatment, is called modified waste EPS (MEPS). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.",2009
Coupled effect of time and temperature on variations of plastic viscosity of highly flowable mortar,Temperature; Fresh concrete; High-range water reducers; Rheology; Plastic viscosity,SELF-CONSOLIDATING CONCRETE; YIELD-STRESS; FLY-ASH; MODIFYING AGENTS; CEMENT PASTES; SUPERPLASTICIZERS; ADSORPTION; BEHAVIOR; MODELS; FLUID,"Self-consolidating concrete (SCC) is being increasingly used as construction material for its workability. However, the theological properties of such concrete, which is made with significant concentration of high-range water-reducing admixture (HRWRA), depend in most cases on the casting temperature of the material. The study presented herein aimed at evaluating the coupled influence of time and temperature on the variations of plastic viscosity (mu) of micro mortar made with polymelamine (PMS), polynaphtalene (PNS) and polycarboxylate (PCP) polymer. In total, seven micro mortar mixtures proportioned with various binder compositions and water-to-binder ratios of 0.42 and 0.53 were prepared at 10 to 33 degrees C. Test results show that the plastic viscosity varies linearly with the coupled effect of time and temperature for mixtures made with PNS or PMS HRWRA. However, for mixtures made with PCP-HRWRA, both temperature and mixture proportioning have influence on the variation of viscosity with time. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2009
The influence of SiMn slag on chemical resistance of blended cement pastes,SiMn slag; Blended cements; Chemical resistance; Physico-mechanical properties,POZZOLANIC MATERIAL; METAKAOLIN; HYDRATION,"During the last decades, industrial by-products and wastes recycling as complementary building materials is focusing a large number of researching studies, most of them dedicated to the cement and concrete production, studying technical, economical and environmental aspects. This paper presents an original contribution to this tendency, which consists on the possibility of recycling a SiMn slag from ferroalloys industry as a complementary construction material and its influence on the resistance of cement paste in different aggressive solutions. Different parameters, such as waste nature, additions, mechanical resistance, different aggressive solutions or morphological and microporosity changes were investigated. The results have showed that blended cement pastes elaborated with SiMn slag (5% and 15% additions) after 56 days of Curing have a good resistance in some aggressive solutions, no losing weight and presenting all excellent resistance index compared to the reference matrix. Aggressive solutions presence do not alter elaborated pastes microporosity not minding if they are prepared with and without SiMn slag additions in the working conditions studied in this study.

Novel concept for producing energy integrating a solar collector with a man made mountain hollow,Solar collector; Chimney; Turbine generators; Mountain hollow,CHIMNEY POWER-PLANT; FLOW-THROUGH; SYSTEMS,"The concept of the solar chimney thermal power technology was proven with the successful operation of the Manzanares prototype built in the 1980s. However, all previous attempts engineering commercial solar chimney thermal power plant on a large scale have failed because of bad and safety. A novel concept for producing energy by integrating a solar collector with a mountain hollow is presented and described. Solar energy is collected in the collector and heats the ground, which is used to store heat energy and heat the indoor air. Then, the hot air is forced by the pressure difference between it and the ambient air to move along the tilted segment and up the vertical segment of the 'chimney', driving the turbine generators to generate electricity. The mountain hollow, formed by excavation in a large-elevation mountain, can avoid the safety issues of erecting a gigantic concrete chimney, which is needed for commercial solar chimney thermal power plants. Furthermore, it can also save a great amount of construction materials for constructing a robust chimney structure and reduce the energy cost to a level less than that of a clean coal power plant, providing a good solution to the reclamation and utilization of undeveloped mountains, especially in mountainous countries.

Carbon implications of end-of-life management of building materials,Carbon dioxide; Concrete; Carbonation; Wood; Post-use material; Construction materials,GREENHOUSE-GAS; WOOD PRODUCTS; ENERGY; CONCRETE; SUBSTITUTION; IMPACTS; CONSTRUCTION; BALANCES; NORWAY; MARKET,"In this study we investigate the effects of post-use material management on the life cycle carbon balance of buildings, and compare the carbon balance of a concrete-frame building to that of a wood-frame building. The demolished concrete is either landfilled. or is crushed into aggregate followed by exposure to air for periods ranging from 4 months to 30 years to increase carbonation uptake of CO2. The demolished wood is assumed to be used for energy to replace fossil fuels. We calculate the carbon flows associated with fossil fuel used for material production, calcination emission from cement manufacture, carbonation of concrete during and after its service life, substitution of fossil fuels by recovered wood residues, recycling of steel, and fossil fuel used for post-use material management. We find that carbonation of crushed concrete results in significant uptake of CO2. However, the CO2 emission from fossil fuel used to crush the concrete significantly reduces the carbon benefits obtained from the increased carbonation due to crushing. Stockpiling crushed concrete for a longer time will increase the carbonation uptake, but may not be practical due to space constraints. Overall. the effect of carbonation of post-use concrete is small. The post-use energy recovery of wood and the recycling of reinforcing steel both give higher carbon benefit than the post-use carbonation. We conclude that carbonation of concrete in the post-use phase does not affect the validity of earlier studies reporting that wood-frame buildings have substantially lower carbon emission than concrete-frame buildings.

Modelling and simulation of concrete leaching under outdoor exposure conditions,Concrete; Modeling; Environmental assessment; Leaching; PHREEQC,TESTS,"Recently, a demand regarding the assessment of release of dangerous substances from construction products was raised by European Commission which has issued the Mandate M/366 addressed to CEN. This action is in relation with the Essential Requirement No. 3 ""Hygiene, Health and Environment"" of the Construction Products Directive (89/106/EC). The potential hazard for environment and health may arise in different life cycle stages of a construction product. During the service life stage, the release of substances due to contact with the rain water is the main potential hazard source, as a consequence of the leaching phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to present the development of a coupled chemical-transport model for the case of a concrete based construction product, i.e. concrete paving slabs, exposed to rain water under outdoor exposure conditions. The development of the model is based on an iterative process of comparing the experimental results with the simulated results up to an acceptable fit. The experiments were conducted at laboratory scale (equilibrium and dynamic leaching tests) and field scale. The product was exposed for one year in two types of leaching scenarios under outdoor conditions, ""runoff"" and ""stagnation"", and the element release was monitored. The model was calibrated using the experimental data obtained at laboratory scale and validated against measured field data, by taking into account the specific rain water balance and the atmospheric CO(2) uptake as input parameters. The numerical tool used in order to model and simulate the leaching behaviour was PHREEQC, coupled with the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) thermodynamic data base. The simulation results are satisfying and the paper demonstrates the feasibility of the modelling approach for the leaching behaviour assessment of concrete type construction materials.

Performance of repaired fire affected RC beams,Fire exposure; flexural strength; paint repair technique; temperature gradient,,"Structural concrete is one of the most commonly used construction materials in the world. Concrete elements exposed to fire experience temperature gradients and, as a result, undergo physical changes or spalling, thereby exposing steel reinforcement. The structural property of concrete that has been most widely studied as a function of temperature exposure is compressive strength. Relatively few studies have been undertaken on flexural strength of reinforced cement concrete (RCC) beams and their repair. Therefore, this study was carried out to generate experimental data on residual flexural strength of heated RCC beams and their strengthening using various repair techniques. A total of 25 RCC beams were cast with similar cross-sectional details, length and grade of concrete and clear cover. Twenty beams were meant for fire exposure and the remaining five were used as companion beams. The beams were heated in two stages. In the first stage, two beams were kept at each temperature for 3 h between 100 degrees C and 1000 degrees C, in increments of 100 degrees C. Beams exposed to temperature ranging between 100 and 500 degrees C were repaired by applying paint. The beams exposed to temperature ranging between 600 and 1000 degrees C were repaired for spalling. In the second stage, all repaired specimens were again heated. These test specimens were tested for flexural strength after bringing them to room temperature. The variation of flexural strength of repaired RCC beams with increase in temperature has been studied and the flexural strength of beams before and after the repair was compared.",2009
A novel cement-based hybrid material,,WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; MATRIX COMPOSITES; GROWTH; MONOXIDE; CATALYSTS; MICROSTRUCTURE; TEMPERATURE; BEHAVIOR; OXIDE,"Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers (CNFs) are known to possess exceptional tensile strength, elastic modulus and electrical and thermal conductivity. They are promising candidates for the next-generation high-performance structural and multi-functional composite materials. However, one of the largest obstacles to creating strong, electrically or thermally conductive CNT/CNF composites is the difficulty of getting a good dispersion of the carbon nanomaterials in a matrix. Typically, time-consuming steps of purification and functionalization of the carbon nanomaterial are required. We propose a new approach to grow CNTs/CNFs directly on the surface of matrix particles. As the matrix we selected cement, the most important construction material. We synthesized in a simple one-step process a novel cement hybrid material (CHM), wherein CNTs and CNFs are attached to the cement particles. The CHM has been proven to increase 2 times the compressive strength and 40 times the electrical conductivity of the hardened paste, i.e. concrete without sand.",2009
Microbial activity on the microstructure of bacteria modified mortar,Bacteria; Image analysis; Mortar matrix; Microstructure; Concrete,SILICA PRECIPITATION; DIVERSITY; CULTURE; WATERS,"Microbial modified mortar or concrete has become all important area of research for high-performance construction materials. This study investigates the effects of incorporating a facultative anaerobic hot spring bacterium on the microstructure of a cement-sand mortar. Environmental scanning electron microscopic (ESEM) views and image analysis (IA) of the bacteria modified mortar (thin-section) showed significant textural differences with respect to the control (without bacteria) samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) study confirmed the formation of new phases of silicates (Gehlenite) within the matrix of such mortar material, which causes an improvement in the strength of the material. Electron probe microstructure analysis (EPMA) suggested that the bacterial treatment promoted uniform distribution of silicate phases and increased the calcium/silicon ratio within CSH gel of the matrices. The bacterium is found to leach a novel protein, which is capable of isolating silica from its source. The addition Of Such isolated protein, instead of the bacteria, into mortar also improves the strength of mortar. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2009
Effect of used-foundry sand on the mechanical properties of concrete,Concrete; Used-foundry sand; Compressive strength; Tensile properties; Elastic moduli,PRODUCTS,"Used-foundry sand is a by-product of ferrous and nonferrous metal casting industries. Foundries successfully recycle and reuse the sand many times in a foundry. When the sand can no longer be reused in the foundry, it is removed from the foundry and is termed used/spent foundry sand. In an effort to utilize used-foundry sand in large volumes, research is being carried out for its possible large-scale utilization in making concrete as partial replacement of fine aggregate. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation carried out to evaluate the mechanical properties of concrete mixtures in which fine aggregate (regular sand) was partially replaced with used-foundry sand (UFS). Fine aggregate was replaced with three percentages (10%, 20%, and 30%) of UFS by weight. Tests were performed for the properties of fresh concrete. Compressive strength, splitting-tensile strength, flexural strength, and modulus of elasticity were determined at 28, 56, 91, and 365 days. Test results indicated a marginal increase in the strength properties of plain concrete by the inclusion of UFS as partial replacement of fine aggregate (sand) and that can be effectively used in making good quality concrete and construction materials.

Simulation on Improving Imaging Resolution of SAFT,ultrasonic test; concrete; SAFT; WDT,CONCRETE; ULTRASOUND,"Concrete is one of the main construction materials in civil engineering. Among the existing Nondestructive Testing (NDT) methods, the imaging techniques that can give a graphic display of the inner structure of the concrete elements have received great attention. Because of several kinds of disturbing signals in the concrete structures imaging by low frequency ultrasound, low signal-noise ratio and poor resolution are engendered. Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT) is one of effect methods in lite ultrasonic NDT area, and can focus effectively to reflected waves, and improve the reconstructed image's resolution through rough B-scan method For low-frequency excitation signal, however, wavepacket distortion is produced during the focusing process, which decreases test resolution. Therefore, Wavepacket Decomposition Technique (WDT), which can put the whole reflected wavepacket into focusing calculation, is introduced here to improve the reconstructed resolution. This technique solves the problem of wavepacket distortion, and better focusing effect and resolution are obtained Furthermore, calculating velocity is increased because the points joined into SAFT calculation are cut down greatly. The presented technique has been verified by the simulation experiment. From the results, the method can improve more the ability of localizing object and give better imaging effect",2009

DEVELOPMENT OF CARBON NANOFIBER SELF-CONSOLIDATING CONCRETE,Carbon Nano-Fiber; Self-Consolidating Concrete; Compressive Strength; Electrical Resistivity; Electrical Resistance Variation; Health Monitoring,CEMENT,"Concrete is a ubiquitous construction material used since ancient times. Cement, the binding component of concrete, develops microcracks during casting and loading which weaken the final concrete structure. Microcracks range in size from picometers to micrometers and eventually lead to abrupt failure if not detected and repaired. In order to restrict the growth of microcracks, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were added to the concrete mix. CNFs have tensile strengths over 7.0 GPa (1015 ksi) and an average length of 20 mu m. These characteristics enable the nanofibers to bridge microcracks and absorb the energy normally released during crack propagation. Additionally, if a continuous circuit of CNFs can be formed throughout the cement matrix, the high conductivity of CNFs makes non-destructive electrical monitoring of concrete structures possible. Due to large Van der Waals forces between CNFs, however, uniform dispersion of the carbon nanofibers throughout the cement matrix is difficult to achieve. In order to improve the dispersal of CNFs, Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) was used to increase flowability throughout the wet concrete. The surfactant sodium lauryl sulfate was used to chemically suspend CNFs in the hydrophilic cement matrix. Ideal mix proportions were characterized by a visual stability index. The electrical resistivity and compressive strength of cylinders were investigated.",2009
EFFECT OF FREEZING-THAWING CYCLES ON THE PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF CONCRETE,concrete; frost action; damage; permeability,CEMENT-BASED MATERIALS; PERMEABILITY; DAMAGE,"Concrete is the most used construction material in practically all of civil engineering fields due to its economical and technical advantages. However, its microstructure is porous and may be completely or partially water saturated. In severely cold climates, this water freezes and degradations develop gradually with the freezing-thawing cycle's number, in forms of internal cracking, chipping and scaling. Frost behaviour is based on the coupling between the 9% volumetric increase during water transformation into ice, the cryo-suction phenomena, the non frozen water transport within the porous network and the thermo-mechanical behaviour of each component of the frozen media. It is thus obvious that the frost resistance depends on the microstructure (pore size distribution and permeability) and the mechanical characteristics of the material. In this paper, physical and mechanical characteristics evolution during freezing-thawing cycles was followed. The results show that the reduction in the mechanical resistance and the elastic modulus is accompanied with an increase in the intrinsic permeability. The damage can be characterized by a scalar parameter, Df, due to frost action. With this parameter, the resistance reduction as well as the permeability evolution may be described, with a good agreement, as a function of cracks development.",2009
LONG TERM BEHAVIOUR OF SELF COMPACTING FIBRE-REINFORCED CONCRETE BEAMS,,EARLY-AGE; SHRINKAGE; CRACKING; SLABS; CREEP,"Self-compacting fibre reinforced concrete extends the versatility of concrete as a construction material, by providing an effective method of overcoming its intrinsic brittleness, and by simplifying the activities necessary for the RC structures construction. The behaviour of this material has been studied by many researchers but the level of knowledge concerning its long term behaviour is still limited. This work describes the first results of an experimental campaign aimed at investigating and comparing the long term behaviour of self-compacting-concrete beams containing steel fibres as well as standard re-bars. In the first stage of the tests the beams were notched in the mid-span section and loaded in order to pre-crack the concrete up to an opening of 0.2 mm. In the second stage of the tests the long term behaviour of the beams was studied by monitoring the mid-span deflection and the crack opening for 200 days, during which the beams were loaded using a four point bending scheme. During this phase the beams were kept in climate controlled room. The results show that the steel fibres are able to reduce, respect to the conventional reinforcement, the crack opening also under long-term loading thus improving the durability and reducing the deformability.",2009

Larger countries may be able to afford the old model of urban sprawl, where the city boundary grows outwards. However, in countries like Singapore, evolving our city of the future will be very different. Singapore has grown without choking on its own exhaust. Its uniqueness as a city state in Southeast Asia requires development of holistic sustainable technologies and solutions for sustainable infrastructure to meet the future social and economic needs of the nation.

"An Observation on the Technical Continuity of Stone Architecture in Kaleici, Antalya",,,"Although Antalya may display traces of some of her cultural past, she is one of the cities that have lost most of that past. Earthquakes and time are among the natural factors, but certainly the biggest of them all is thee cultures that have settled in the city uninterruptedly and been shaped under different religious beliefs. Each of the many social cultural concepts that formed in the course of this process was either denied or altered by the succeeding one and thus many of such concepts disappeared. In this process, concepts regarding construction materials, motifs, forms and techniques, which are not part of the social and modifiable culture, have survived to the present. Although it is not possible to identify the constructional past of, Antalya to a great extent, careful observations and scientific studies on Kaleici, the focal point of the settlement and environs, will shed some light on this darkness. Our study has developed in this direction and concentrated on an important detail on the facade of a 19(th) century Rum, mansion on Kocatepe Street today but which faced a small square known as Kuyu Onu originally. The building studied here does not have the modern reinforced concrete Construction or the traditional timber skeleton architecture; the juxtaposition of clamps and dowels in the walls, the facing blocks on the facade and particularly the characteristics of its doors and windows on both facades indicate that some structural, decorative, technical and static elements arising from construction materials of Antiquity were transferred until the beginning of the 20(th) century. The relieving systems observed above a door on the main facade are worth noting for its wide use in the ancient city Centre of Antalya and nearby ancient cities. What is even more important is that this technical property has been used in Kaleici until recently and its presence has also been attested on Hidirlik Tower which was built in the Early Roman period. This technical detail continued in use during the Byzantine, Seljuq and Ottoman periods as seen on Kesik Minare, Imaret Madrasa and Tekelioglu Mehmet Pasha Mosque, and it is not limited to the door and windows of the mansion studied here but rather was preferred to a certain extent on some other 19,h and 20(th) century buildings both inside and outside the Kaleici, thus extending through every cultural phase of the city.",2009
APPLICATION OF EROSION-CONTROL MATERIALS AND SPONTANEOUS VEGETATION IN THE PROTECTION OF RESERVOIRS IN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SERBIA,Reservoirs; catchments; erosion-control materials; stone; concrete; vegetation; examination; ecological quality; water,,"The quality and stability of erosion-control materials in protection of reservoirs in Southern and Eastern Serbia have been examined both in the field and in accredited laboratories in our country. Field investigations have been carried out over a period of 15 years in Eastern Serbia and for up to 30 years in Southern Serbia, and they are still being conducted by monitoring the state and possible damage of consolidation-retention check dams, walls, and other erosion-control structures. The materials used in protection of the Selova and Grliste Reservoirs are typical construction materials, such as resistant natural stone, concrete of the BI group, i.e., MB 20, aggregate, synthetic elements, etc. Longterm monitoring of their state and minor deformations has shown that the materials were well-chosen and stable, and that there has been no significant damage, except for some minor crumbling and smaller cracks due to negligible scouring. This is all the result of prior thorough empirical and laboratory testing of applied materials, which helped to achieve stability and functionality of structures erected to prevent silting-up of the reservoir. Such a state has contributed to stabilization of erosion processes and reduction of sediment quantities, improvement of water quality, and advancement of the autochthonous vegetation (Salix L., Cornus L., Quercus L.). Vegetation has further mitigated erosion, decreased floods, and consolidated the structures, thereby improving the ecological quality of the catchments as well as the entire study area.",2009

Mechanical properties considered were compressive strength, and flexural strength. The durability properties considered was: sulphate resistance, In general strength and sulphate resistance of High Volume Fly Ash (HVFA) were considerably affected by amount of fly ash. Also, the strength properties for the 20 % fly ash mixtures were either comparable or superior to the no-fly ash concrete.

During eightieth years, awareness of disadvantages of concrete structures change as well as the approach to durability design. Ninetieth years bring accelerated highway construction as well as work on the large number of structures. During this period, main criterion in bridge structure design is rapidity and simplicity of construction in spite of obvious disadvantages. Nowadays, new European codes have been accepted and expected service life of bridge structures is between seventy and hundred years.

One laminated bamboo-frame house per hectare per year,Bamboo; Laminated bamboo; Renewable resources; Construction materials; Innovation,,"This paper presents an outline of a quantitative analysis that demonstrates the global potential of bamboo as a ""modern"" construction material. The underlying goal is to contribute to a real shift in resource management by focussing on renewable resources in general and on the high brow, modern use of bamboo as an alternative for construction products such as concrete, brick and (hard) wood in particular. The analysis illustrates how laminated bamboo-frame building could be a direct alternative for wood-frame building, bamboo having a great advantage in yearly yield per forest area compared to wood. Current and potential bamboo resources in Colombia are posed against required material volumes for constructing a model house, resulting in a practical and realistic view on bamboo's global potential on lowering the environmental impact of the built environment.

A design for de-fragmentation of concrete materials to decline the vulnerability in the reconstruction of houses,fiber reinforced concrete; seismic application; material de-fragmentation; structural safety element; externally bonded FRP,CEMENTITIOUS COMPOSITES,"In an integrated building system optimization of the sub-systems and the segments is a key issue. Improving the structural elements and materials for a reconstruction after an earthquake is even more important than a normal construction. Because earthquakes annually cause big economic and human impacts on world's society such as losses of energy (causing depletion of natural resources in a large scale), efforts, and lives. With building destruction in seismic areas, the collapse of construction materials and their weight is the main reason for fatalities and severe injuries. Houses as the major inhabited buildings are the main subject of the collapse or damages in earthquakes.

Developing viable products using recycled rubber tyres in concrete,,PARTICLES,"The growing problem of waste tyre disposal in the UK can be alleviated if new recycling routes can be found for the anticipated surplus of tyres. One of the largest potential routes is in construction, but usage of waste tyres in civil engineering is currently very low. This study investigates the potential of incorporating recycled rubber tyres into Cement CEM 1 concrete and concrete blocks. It was found that rubberised concrete exhibited very low workability and a marked reduction in strength which inhibits its use for general structural applications. However, the potential was found for producing low strength products such as rubberised concrete block with beneficial properties. The production method replicated that used in industry was produced successfully. As part of the effort in developing new construction materials, it is essential to establish its economic viability as well as its technical viability.",2009

Building of a Sustainable Ecological Village in the Amazon - Related Projects and Activities,,,"The location and implementation of a Green Materials and Processes Program centered in environmental themes; at Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM), has gained momentum with the ""First Amazonian Meeting of Green Materials and Processes"", held on August 18-20, 2008, in Manaus, Amazonas, at Universidade Federal do Amazonas. This motivation was mainly the result of a project of a multi-family house village; utilizing green building processes and comprising rain water utilization and ecological sewage treatment. Besides traditional construction materials (cement, sand, clay, wood, and ceramic tiles), bamboo based wall panels were used. Wall panel structures were prefabricated with a wood frame, whole bamboo culms placed as studs and bamboo strips on the outside. Wood and treated bamboo elements were dried in a solar drying kiln. Concrete blocks were used for foundation placing the wall panel at 20 cm above ground level. Plastic sewage pipes were installed below ground. After wall framing and bracing, roof framing took place using wood elements covered by clay tiles. Water and electrical pipes and fixtures were installed in the wall framing of the building according to plans. Earth of high clay content from the construction site was mixed with bamboo chips, and filled into the wall gaps. This bamboo-clay mixture produced a lighter and more stable filling than regular clay soil abundant in the region. After drying, usual plaster was applied to protect the wall. An industrial residue (hydrated lime of carburet) was used to paint the walls. This prototype ecological village comprised of eight houses was constructed at Adolpho Ducke Forest Reserve, in Manaus. The group being consolidated is involved in establishing a Doctorate Program at UFAM, and initiating research in areas such as high performance green composites (Professor Anil Netravali), modification of cellulose surface by plasma and layer by layer deposition (Professor Juan P Hinestroza), preparation and utilization of cellulose nanofibrils (Professor Orlando Rojas), and concrete-cellulose fibers (Professor Romildo D. Toledo Filho).",2009
Improvement of the Strength of Acrylic Emulsion Polymer-modified Mortar in High Temperature and High Humidity by Blast Furnace Slag,polymer-modified mortar; high temperature and high humidity cycles; blast furnace slag,REPAIR MORTARS,"Polymer modification was widely used to improve the properties of construction materials. The concept of polymer modification for mortar and concrete was put forward 80 years ago. It was known that the use of polymers for modification can greatly improve the strength, adhesion, resilience, impermeability, chemical resistance and durability properties of mortars and concrete. In southern Vietnam, a tropical weather country, the environment was usually hot with high humidity. The durability of mortar or concrete coating was reduced over time in such a condition. This study examines the strength of polymer-modified mortars in high temperature and high humidity. Moreover, the results included the improvement of strength of acrylic emulsion polymer-modified mortar (PMM) by the addition of blast furnace slag. Fifteen percent cement was replaced with blast furnace slag (BFS) in a mix proportion in order to improve strength of PMM. The specimens were cured in cycles 50 +/- 2 degrees C, RH 90 +/- 3%, for 5 hours and 20 +/- 2 degrees C, RH 60 +/- 3 %, for 19 hours per day. The strength of PMM was measured at the age of 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days, 3 and 6 months and 1 year in a high temperature and high humidity cycles.",2009

Progress in Nanoscale Studies of Hydrogen Reactions in Construction Materials,,RESONANCE REACTION ANALYSIS; TRICALCIUM SILICATE; HYDRATION,"Nuclear resonance reaction analysis (NRRA) has been applied to measure the nanoscale distribution of hydrogen with depth in the hydration of cementitious phases. This has provided a better understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics of cement hydration during the induction period that is critical to improved concrete technology. NRRA was also applied to measure the hydrogen depth profiles in other materials used in concrete construction such as fly ash and steel. By varying the incident beam energy one measures a profile with a depth resolution of a few nanometers. Time-resolved measurements are achieved by stopping the chemical reactions at specific times. Effects of temperature, sulfate concentration, accelerators and retarders, and superplasticizers have been investigated. Hydration of fly ashes has been studied with synthetic glass specimens whose chemical compositions are modeled on those of actual fly ashes. A combinatorial chemistry approach was used where glasses of different compositions are hydrated in various solutions for a fixed time. The resulting hydrogen depth profiles show significant differences in hydrated phases, rates of depth penetration and amount of surface etching. Hydrogen embrittlement of steel was studied on slow strain rate specimens under different corrosion potentials.",2009

THE INFLUENCE OF THE BAUHAUS ON CROATIAN INTERWAR ARCHITECTURE,,,"The investigation of the Bauhaus - as one of the most intriguing artistic and educational experiments in contemporary European cultural and art history - does not lose its momentum and relevance right up to the present day. The research on the impact and significance of this famous avant-garde school is especially emphasized this year, when we celebrate go years from the school's foundation. This essay follows in such efforts and is dedicated to locating the influence that the Bauhaus had on the development of architectural thinking in Croatia in the period between the two world wars. In 1919, the year when the Bauhaus was founded in Weimar, Zagreb established its Technical Faculty, with a separate Architectural Department - a moment that marked the beginning of the university-level education of architects in Croatia. In 1926, the year when the Bauhaus moved to Dessau and opened a new period in the academic orientation and program of this avant-garde school, Zagreb witnessed the foundation of a new, quite specific and progressive architecture school, the so-called ""Ibler School"", run by Drago Ibler at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts. just like the Bauhaus, the ""Ibler School"" would not last for long, and would be closed in 1942 due to unfavorable war circumstances, but it will just like the Bauhaus itself - leave the deep and lasting imprint on the artistic life of its environment. More than this curious overlapping of dates and formats of the academic frameworks, what interests us here is a possible closer and more consequential correspondence of the two artistic environments. In that sense we might observe the architecture of Zagreb in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and compare it with the contemporary works of the Bauhaus teachers and students. Such comparison would soon reveal a convincing synchronicity and simultaneity of compared architectures, both in terms of the date of their appearance, and in terms of their aesthetics, expressions, materials, effects and forms. That would point to some more substantial closeness ad correspondence of the two creative environments. This closeness might be explained by the early appearance of the Bauhaus thought and ideas in Zagreb. By the early 1920s Zagreb had two bookstores that kept Bauhaus editions; various local art journals of the time were reporting on the profile and programs of that avant-garde school, and numerous texts of the Bauhaus leading theorists (Gropius, Kandinsky) were published on their pages, just as the works of the prominent Bauhaus teachers (H. Meyer, L. Moholy-Nagy). Recorded were also several visits of Bauhaus teachers and students. As a direct channel of influences we should stress the line of Croatian students who studied at the Bauhaus, in its various phases and in various artistic fields, from the textile art to photography - O. Berger, M. Baranyai and I. Tomljenovic. To confirm a direct architectural link with that vanguard school it is essential to mention the Croatian architect Gustav Bohutinsky, who studied at the Bauhaus in the summer semester Of 1930. And yet, regardless of such undoubtedly important and productive direct contacts, the key moment in understanding the genuine closeness of the two creative environments is the deeper correspondence of their artistic sensibilities, i.e., the already formed proclivity of Croatian architects towards creative approaches and procedures that were cultivated by the Bauhaus. Namely, as the prominent Bauhaus student Farkas Molnar would claim, the architectural forms that we usually recognize as ""Bauhaus forms"" or ""Bauhaus style"" were not the issue of some arbitrary aesthetic, formal and stylistic choice, but rather a true and correct architectural answer to questions and problems raised by the immediate social context. It is such essential matters that then directed the socially conscious and responsible architecture to the ideas of functionality, rationality, and technological and structural objectivity, which then in turn - mediated by inevitable artistic intervention and experiment - ended up producing just such innovative formal outcomes and results. It is precisely in such deeper reasons and in the very method of thinking and working that we should try to look for genuine closeness and connections. That Croatian architecture has been, all throughout its past, due to unfavorable political and economic circumstances, marked by a note of restraint, rigor, and formal discipline, and guided by ideas of usefulness, rationality and objectivity is a fact already very well known. Yet as an answer to such limited means, it always reacted with heightened conceptual precision and quality, along with sharpened innovation and experiment. In such way Croatian architecture formed its own authentic method of working and design procedure, which relied more on the logic and clarity of creative and spatial concept than on the richness of formal expression. When such inherent rational tradition encountered severe social problems of the interwar period, there came to a particularly objective, functional and socially responsible architectural reaction. This starts to explain the surprising correspondence in thinking and creative approaches of the Bauhaus and the local architectural scene, just as in their ensuing formal outcomes and results. Such was the platform on which architectural students at the Technical Faculty were brought up and raised. And with the establishment, in 1926, of that experimental and progressive ""Ibler School"", the correspondence with the Bauhaus poetics became even stronger. As an especially convincing testimony of ideological proximity of the two schools, one ought to stress that Ibler himself was deeply devoted to social issues. As a matter of fact, together with his like-minded colleagues he founded in 1929 the group ""Zemlja"", a group of progressive painters, sculptors, applied artists and architects, dedicated to social issues, which they intended to solve through joint artistic intervention. Small wonder then that it is precisely from this ""Ibler School"" that its student Gustav Bohutinsky, after completing third year of his study, decided to leave for the Bauhaus. After one semester spent at the Bauhaus, in spring Of 1930, and exposure to the ideas of Meyer and Hilberseimer, Bohutinsky returned to Zagreb, graduated at the ""Ibler School"", and started to produce architecture which then rightfully and justly reminds of familiar Bauhaus forms, and not out of some arbitrary stylistic choice. The influence of the Bauhaus in Bohutinsky's oeuvre is most evident in the atelier that he built for his brother, the sculptor Emil Bohutinsky, in 1945 in Zagreb. With its simple cubic form, large glass front, functional spatial organization and exposed construction materials - concrete, brick and glass - it most convincingly testifies to the presence of Bauhaus thought. And yet, it is not just Bohutinsky, as the immediate Bauhaus student, but that whole generation of Croatian architects - faithful to their deeply embraced method of creation and rational functional experiments - that will end up producing architectural works which would recall the familiar Bauhaus forms, testifying thereby not to mere import of style but to the genuine correspondence of their respective artistic and social goals.",2009
Stone arch bridges and traditional repairing techniques in eastern Blacksea region of Turkey,,,"Anatolia (Turkey) is one of the oldest settlements all over the world due to the geographical location. Thus, it has accommodated innumerable historical structures remain from the past civilizations. Stone arch bridges are one of the most invaluable historical structures between them. Transportation and trading were among the important reasons for people to built arch bridges on the rivers. They were built with stone before iron, steel or concrete bridges were introduced and most of them are still in strong condition. There are so many stone arch bridges of different periods, which are protected by the state and have the status of ""Cultural Heritage"". The Cender Suyu Bridge, Karamagara Bridge and the Justinianus Bridge are the examples of Roman bridges in Turkey. The perfect workmanship in the construction of the cut stones put the beauty of the Seljuk Bridges forward; however, the best examples of bridge architecture in Turkey are the works constructed in the 16th century of Master Builder Sinan who constructed 11 bridges. However, many arch bridges have been frequently damaged or collapsed due to the natural disasters, time effects and also manmade damages. In this paper, it is aimed to present the general characteristics of historical stone arch bridges located in the East Blacksea Region of Turkey. Besides, some deterioration in the construction materials, damages and failure patterns are classified into main groups and discussed with some illustrative photos. Some traditional repairing techniques and their practices are described with detailed information and illustrative photos.",2009
ROLE OF REACTIVE VITREOUS COATINGS IN REINFORCED CONCRETE IN NUCLEAR PLANT CONSTRUCTION,,,"Reinforced concrete is the basic construction material in commercial nuclear power plants in the United States. The continued performance of these critical concrete structures is necessary to ensure the safety of plant personnel and the public in the surrounding area. Designs for complex concrete and steel structures such as containment domes, where steel frames and steel reinforcement have to bond securely to the surrounding concrete, encounter the problem making concrete adhere to steel. Concrete condition surveys conducted at nuclear power plants have shown that problems can develop at nuclear plants during operations that are typical of aging reinforced concrete structural members. Corrosion of the embedded steel is especially a problem where the concrete is exposed to moisture and oxygen can diffuse down to the concrete-steel interface and cause rust formation, expansion and cracking. The recent development of new engineered coatings for reinforcing steel that are based on using an alkali-resistant vitreous enamel to coat the steel and to fuse reactive calcium silicates and aluminates to the surface of the steel can be used to address both the bonding and the corrosion problem in reinforced concrete",2009
Application of Waste Sands for Making Industrial Floors,,REINFORCED CONCRETE SLABS; FIBER,"Concrete is the most commonly known composite material used in civil engineering, thus concrete production influences significantly the natural environment especially in developing countries. The main component of cement composite is aggregate which covers from 60% to 80% of cement composite volume. Global annual production of concrete, mortar and other cement based composites consumes 20 billion tonne of different aggregate. It means that about 3 tonne of aggregate is used per person per year. The production of ordinary concrete usually consumes coarse aggregate (e.g. gravel) and fine aggregate (e.g. sand) in weight proportion approximately equal to 3:1. If the weight proportion of the occurring of coarse aggregate and fine aggregate in a specific geographical region were close to 3:1, then the production of cement composites would be entirely balanced and would be carried out without any aggregate waste. Unfortunately, natural resources of coarse and fine aggregates can be found in very different weight proportions. For example, natural aggregates in Pomerania region in Poland are of glacial origin and they occur in a form of sands and all-in-aggregates. Production of ordinary concrete based on such, locally available fine aggregate is hindered. High transport costs of coarse aggregate from distant pit deposits (often over 200km) to the production facility, force producers to use the process of hydroclassification of natural all-in-aggregate in order to receive coarse aggregate. Approximately half of documented deposits of aggregate in the Pomerania region is constituted by deposits hydroclassified during the exploitation. Process of hydroclassification allows to divide all-in-aggregate into coarse aggregate and fine aggregate. Waste fine aggregate is a by-product of hydroclassification process. Because of a huge deficit of coarse aggregate in the region, coarse aggregate obtained during hydroclassification of all-in-aggregate is constantly being sold and always on demand enlarging heaps of waste sand. In the paper an issue of waste sand utilization was raised. Various civil engineering applications of waste fine aggregate cement composites have proved that meticulously made fine aggregate cement composite is characterized by satisfactory strength and durability in order to be applied in civil engineering as a standard construction material. One of examples how to resolve the waste sand utilization problem could be its application for the production of steel fiber reinforced mineral composites used for industrial floors. The authors introduced their tests results based on selected properties of fine aggregate fibrous composites with different amounts of steel fiber. The study is a small part of a broad research program.",2009
Characterization of Wasted Wash-Stone for a Possible Re-Use in Construction Materials,Wasted wash-stone; recycling material characterization; light-weight concrete; sustainable building,,"Wasted wash-stone, based on pumice and expandable clay, deriving from textile treatment in industrial laundries is generally land-filled. It is also well known that natural pumice is used as aggregate for manufacturing light-weight concrete. The use of light-weight concrete is becoming more and more relevant due to its lightness and thermal-acoustic insulation properties in accordance with sustainable building principles. The possibility of replacing natural pumice with wasted wash-stone of laundries could lead to a decrease in the waste flux to disposal, to exempt companies from the related taxes and to a reduction in the extraction of non-renewable raw materials from quarries. The results obtained in this work show that the properties of the characterized wasted wash-stone are comparable with those of a commercial pumice used as aggregate to manufacture light-weight concretes. The main negative characteristics of the analyzed samples, in view of a possible re-use as aggregate in concrete, are the low reproducibility and the significant presence of organic substances (congruent to 8%) which could slow down the set time and the hardening process of the cementitious materials. However, the problem could be overcome by changing the sampling point of the waste material in the processing cycle before disposal.",2009
Wastewater Treatment Using Eco Bio-Construction Material Technology,aerobic; biomaterials; construction; performance; pollution; wastewater,,"Reclaimed wastewater can be considered as additional water resources and its planned reuse for lower grade purposes (other than drinking) will result in large saving of potable water supplies. Polluted water has to be cleaned up immediately by a suitable natural ecological system. In this paper, research inputs on water supply and wastewater treatment systems by using eco bio-construction (EBC) material technology have been presented. EBC constructed households, industries and farms are efficient for natural cleaning of discharged effluents according to environmental standards for the design period of ten years. EBC materials are obtained from volcanic resource called volcanic ashes. They are highly porous in nature. In India, porous rock-soil materials blasted from various kinds of Himalayan rocks and other geological structures are the common sources of EBC material. It is the main ingredient in EBC material technology. EBC materials cleanup water through coexistence with microorganisms called aerobic microbiological process. This natural clean up systems using aerobic microbiological process are effective and efficient for wastewater treatment. Aerobic bacteria are a kind of grass bacillus taken from sea bottom and mountains. They are safe microorganisms with a determined DNA sequence. In porous biomaterials, mixture of this effective aerobic bacteria and feed are sprayed and get sealed. Such aerobic bacteria propagate and function as cleanup mechanisms by fermentation. During the cleaning process, aerobic bacteria come into contact with water. Fermentation process occurs in porous media and bacteria start propagation and go out of media. The bacteria degrade organic matter and convert into carbon dioxide and water and thus cleans up sewage water. Since, feed (that is food) for the bacteria are already enclosed, its effectiveness and efficiency is constantly achieved. EBC materials are made up of paste mixture containing volcanic porous stones or ashes, strong alkaline cement, appropriate quantity of water and effective bacteria sealed in a live and propagation state. Volcanic stones are rich in minerals and their fine porous structure is optimal for habitation of microorganisms. EBC material concrete technology made from a kind of fermented-soybeans bacillus which can be simulated from the sources of aerobic bacteria grow in mulch made from leaves in nature. These bacteria are viable in air and water. It degrades e.coli and anaerobic putrefactive bacteria thus sanitizing the environment. EBC microbes kill mosquito larva, which is of medical importance. By getting rid of mosquito larva, it can be used for controlling communicable diseases. This paper has provided overview of this technology applied in water supply and wastewater treatment projects. Such projects investigated are namely domestic sewerage treatment systems. storm sewerage systems, combined sewerage systems, industrial sewerage systems, water channels, constructed wetlands and public sewers, river channels, industrial wastewater sewers, constructed wetlands, wastewater treatment systems, sewage farms, pearl and fish farms and other ocean constructions. EBC material technology has also been applied to water purification systems. Wastewater quality has been achieved in such a way that aquatic vegetation can grow and fish can inhabitant in it. The EBC material structures works on the principle of ""natural way of cleaning water"" by absorbing pollutants and removing bad odor. EBC technological projects have an effective working life of ten seven years in running water and have been successfully tested in various construction projects for the purification of industrial wastewater and polluted water bodies. These remove total dissolved solids (TDS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) suspended particulate matter (TSS), organic pollutants, color and odor, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand, nitrogen and phosphorus and bad odor from water and kill mosquito larvae. EBC management practices have been investigated in open drains. It is has been reported that there is a drastic reduction in the content of total suspended solids (TSS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Treatment of sewage using this construction material can prevent pollution. It is a one-time investment. It can cut off 40-45 % power consumption and 55-60% cost of maintenance (COM) compared to other conventional wastewater treatments plants. There were EBC material structures laid down for about 500 meters in open drain. Samples have been collected and their results are very much a satisfactory. Such results are (1) killing of larval mosquitoes to considerable extent, (ii) 70% rate of reduction of Total suspended solids, nitrates and phosphates (iii) total detention time (iv) removal of color and foul smell to an extent of 90%. EBC materials structures could be used in house sewers. The results of performance tests undertaken in various wastewater supply and sanitation projects are provided in this research paper. This eco-friendly technology has been evaluated for its performance with a particular reference to techno-commercial, economical and environmental aspects. The construction method is cost effective, durable and efficient. It is recommended that EBC material technology can be used in water supply and wastewater treatment construction projects and thus the reclaimed wastewater can be used as additional water resources for sustainable water development.",2009

While enhanced efficiency in the production of concrete is not likely to dramatically reduce the CO2 emissions, cement replacement by a supplementary material or mineral additive, such as silica fume, which is not associated with CO2 emission, can substantially reduce the aforementioned problem. The present work discusses the benefits of incorporating mineral additives in concrete and shows that these additives can improve both the mechanical and physical properties of the end-product, and hence its durability, albeit with a reduction in cement content.",2009
Investigations of Durability Parameters of Concrete by Means of Embedded Flexible Fiber-Optic Fabry-Perot Interferometers,Concrete; durability; fiber-optic sensor; Fabry-Perot interferometer,,"The primary intention of construction materials research is to refer the durability of concrete members to a measurable parameter. Setting, shrinkage, and temperature deformations compromise the durability of high-performance concrete. The respective deformation measurement technology is becoming an indispensible method for the targeted and economic development of concrete mixtures with respect to durability. A flexible EFPI sensor enables the survey of early age deformations directly after placing the concrete. The paper deals with the sensor principle, investigations concerning in-situ referencing, and possible effects of the sensor on the matrix as well as its application in the field of materials research.",2009
Damage detection of a steel-concrete composite frame by a multilevel approach: Experimental measurements and modal identification,steel-concrete composite frame; capacity design; partial-strength joints; system identification; damage assessment; vibration monitoring,JOINTS,"Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) have revealed to be really efficient tools For the damage detection of structures and structural elements in many engineering fields (Shock Vib. Dig. 11998 30(2):91-105: Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 2007; 365(1851):303-315; Mecil. Syst.Signal Process. 2003: 17(1):133-142; Philos. Trans. R. Soc.: Math. Phys. Eng.

Unfortunately the great variety of morphologies, construction materials and Structural schemes makes these techniques not easily applicable to buildings, due to inherent problems related to the location and the extent of damage, the sensitivity of the dynamic response to damage, the choice of damage indexes to be used, the sensors' location. etc. On the other hand, the modern seismic capacity design of buildings in earthquake-prone areas tends to locate dissipative zones in well-determined portions of structures (CEN, European Committee for Standardization. EN 1998-1. Eurocode 8: Design of Structures for Earthquake Resistance. Part 1: General Rides. Seismic Actions and Rules for Buildings. European Community, Brussels, Belgium, 2005); thus, the application of vibration-based damage detection techniques to earthquake-resistant structures seems to be very promising even if nowadays there are only few studies on these arguments. The present paper reports the experiences of a vibration-based damage identification study applied to a steel-concrete composite frame structure, suitably designed to be high ductile according to Eurocode 8 and localizing the seismic energy dissipation in the beam-to-column joints. The structure was subjected to series of pseudo-dynamic (PsD) and cyclic tests with increasing peak ground acceleration at the European Laboratory for Structural Assessment of Joint Research Centre at Ispra (VA. Italy). The damaging phenomena, caused by PsD tests, were assessed and quantified by means of a multi-level vibration-based approach suitably designed in order to evaluate the changes in the global dynamic structural response and to experimentally estimate the reduction in joint stiffness.

The Interaction between High-Alumina Concrete and Low-Temperature Melt on the Base of Potassium Cryolite,,,"Using the gravimetrical method, the kinetics of the interaction of high-alumina concrete with the melt of fluoride KF-AlF(3) in the temperature range from 700 to 800 degrees C is considered. Such analysis allows one to observe the variation in the weight of the examined material placed into the molten salt mixture during the experiment and to calculate the rate of the weight increment. As a result of the investigations, the way the concrete binding material interacts with the melt is revealed. The character and kinetics of this interaction are affected by the concentration of dissolved Al(2)O(3), melt temperature, and preliminary thermal treatment of the concrete. After the experiments with the melt saturated by alumina (5 wt % Al(2)O(3), T = 700 degrees C), the samples totally kept their form and sizes. When the alumina content in the melt is lower than 2.5 wt %, the samples are subjected to corrosion.

Energy and environmental indicators related to construction of office buildings,Construction materials environmental assessment; Embodied energy; Sustainable construction,LIFE-CYCLE ENERGY; RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION; EMBODIED ENERGY; WOOD; PERFORMANCE; CONCRETE; TECHNOLOGIES; EMISSIONS; BALANCES; SAVINGS,"Buildings' construction has a major determining role on the environment through consumption of land and raw materials and generation of waste. It is also a significant user of non-renewable energy and an emitter of greenhouse gases and other gaseous wastes. As environmental issues continue to become increasingly significant, buildings become more energy efficient and the energy needs for their operation decreases. Thus, the energy required for construction and consequently, for the material production, is getting of greater importance. The present paper investigates the role of different construction materials and quantifies them in terms of the embodied energy and the equivalent emissions Of CO(2) and SO(2) in contemporary office buildings. It also assesses the importance of the embodied energy of the building's structure as compared to the operational energy of the building. It was shown that the embodied energy of the structure's building materials (concrete and reinforcement steel) represents the largest component in the building's total embodied energy of the examined buildings, varing from 66.73% to 59.57%, while the embodied energy of the building envelope's materials represents a lower but significant proportion of the building's total embodied energy. When the construction elements are examined, the slabs have the higher contribution at the embodied energy of the studied buildings and from the envelope elements, the external wall is contributing the maximum in the overall embodied energy of the building. The embodied energy correspondence varies between 12.55 and 18.50% of the energy needed for the operation of an office building over a 50 years life. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Feasibility study of lightweight cement composite containing flax by-product particles: Physico-mechanical properties,Agricultural wastes; Flax by-product particles; Lightweight cement composite; Protein air-entraining agent; Hydration test; Inhibitory index; Fresh and hardened properties,PORTLAND-CEMENT; CONCRETE; WOOD; HYDRATION; FIBERS; WASTE; ASH,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential utilisation of flax by-products in cementitious matrices, as aggregate additives, to develop lightweight construction materials that could be used for load-bearing walls. A material containing different amounts of flax particles, ranging from 0% to 10% as partial replacement of cement, was aerated by artificially entrapping air voids by means of a protein air-entraining agent. The composites were characterised by destructive and non-destructive testing. Analyses were made regarding the inhibitory effect of flax particles on hydration of cement, and the properties of the fresh and hardened composite. The results of hydration test have shown that an increase of flax particles in the cement matrix increases the inhibitory effect on cement hydration with a long setting time of the composite. For a specific mix with 10% of flax particles replacement, the corresponding inhibitory index-value of 57.5% classifies the mixture as being of ""high inhibition"". However, the use of calcium chloride reduced the inhibitory effect on cement hydration, resulting in a ""low inhibition"" classification. Results from tests performed on fresh composite have shown attractive properties such as improvements in workability and air-entrainment with increasing flax particles. Study of the hardened composite obtained from oven dried specimens has indicated a significant reduction in sample unit weight, along with compressive strengths compatible with the basic requirement of lightweight construction materials, corresponding to RILEM ""class III"" recommendations. The reduction in flexural strength was lower than that in compressive strength. The results have also shown a high reduction in the dynamic elastic modulus, which indicates a high level of sound insulation of the composite. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2008
Comparative life-cycle cost analysis of pedestrian bridges made from different materials,,,"Considerable maintenance costs may accrue during the life time of infrastructure objects. Therefore, the choice of construction options should not only be made based on purchase price, but also taking into account expected follow-up costs. Against this background, a study conducted with Deutsche Bahn AG and Peter Maier Leichtbau GmbH analyzed which construction material promises the best overall cost-effectiveness for pedestrian bridges. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated based on a life-cycle-cost analysis. This study investigated pedestrian bridges built of conventional construction materials wood, steel and reinforced concrete, as well as bridges made of aluminium alloy. An annuity was chosen to be the comparison value for life-cycle costs. For coping with uncertainties in cost determination and forecasting, diverse sensitivity analyses were used to verify their effects on the final results. Aluminium alloy came out to be the most cost-effective option for the bridge system investigated within this study.",2008
Protecting buildings against feral pigeons,Columba livia; behavior; building structures; deterrent systems; constructional restrictions,,"Feral pigeons (Columba livia, Gmelin 1789) cause different problems for building owners when using structures for daytime perching, sleeping, and breeding. Problems include fouling of building facades and pavements, transmission of allergens and pathogenic microorganisms, and infestations with ectoparasites emanating from breeding sites. Owners are primarily interested in keeping away unwanted pigeons from their property. Pest control companies offer different deterrent systems, of widely varying efficacy, for proofing buildings against feral pigeons. A better solution is avoiding attractive structures during building design or subsequent alterations of existing structures used by feral pigeons. With our study, we elaborate the relevant structural data to help to maintain a building free of pigeons. We performed experiments with free ranging feral pigeons in a feral pigeon loft in the City of Basel, Switzerland. The maximum outlet width a pigeon is not able to pass through is 4 cm; the respective outlet height is 5 cm and a pigeon-safe square opening is not larger than 6x6 cm. The maximum ledge width a pigeon is not able to sit on is 4 cm. The pigeon-safe angle of inclination for smooth construction materials (tinplate, glass, plastics) is 25 degrees, for medium rough materials (wood, plane concrete) 35 degrees, and for rough materials (sandstone, rough concrete) at least 50 degrees. Additionally, we studied the behavioral strategies used by feral pigeons to surmount our experimental constructional restrictions, ledge width, and ledge inclinations. Our data provide the essential data to prevent feral pigeons from using building structures.",2008

Nine types of building material were surveyed for their natural radioactivity contents using high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometry. The activity concentrations for (226)Ra, (232)Th and (40)K varied from 11.5 to 49 Bq kg(-1), 16 to 37 Bq kg(-1) and 306 to 774 Bq kg(-1), respectively. The absorbed dose rate in the samples investigated at 1 m above ground level ranged from 28.5 to 66.6 nGy h(-1). External and internal hazard indices were also estimated as defined by the European Commission. The Ra equivalents of the materials studied ranged from 57.5 to 133 Bq kg(-1) and are much smaller than the recommended limit of 370 Bq kg(-1) for construction materials for dwellings. Polycarbonate nuclear track detectors (NTDs), type CR-39, were used for measuring the radon concentration from different materials. In fact, knowledge of the radon exhalation rate from building materials is important for understanding the individual contribution of each material to the total indoor radon exposure. Samples were hermetically closed in glass vessels and the radon growth was followed as a function of time. The radon exhalation rate was therefore derived from the experimental measurement of a-track densities. The radon exhalation varied from (5.77 +/- 0.06) x 10(-5) to (7.61 +/- 0.07) x 10(-5) Bq cm(-2) h(-1) in bricks, from (5.79 +/- 0.05) x 10(-5) to (11.6 +/- 0.12) x 10(-5) in tiles, and was (6.95 +/- 0.03) x 10(-5) Bq cm(-2) h(-1) in concrete. A correlation (correlation coefficient similar or equal to 0.8) was found between radium concentration measured with a HPGe detector and the radon exhalation rate obtained using nuclear track detectors.",2008
"Waste not, want not: The need to utilize existing artificial structures for habitat improvement along urban rivers",artificial structures; habitat creation; River Thames; river walls; urban river,HYDROCHORY; COMPLEXITY,"Urban rivers have often experienced substantial engineering modification and consequently are highly degraded aquatic ecosystems with minimal riparian habitat. Habitat restoration and improvement efforts are needed within urban rivers to support ecological communities and increase ecosystem integrity. Most river restoration techniques are not feasible within large urban rivers, and so there is a need to develop novel methodologies. Artificial structures such as river walls can function as habitat for plant and invertebrate species in urban rivers, and in some cases can be more diverse than remnant habitat. Along the River Thames through central London, plant species richness was found to be significantly higher on river walls than intertidal foreshore, which represents the only remnant habitat for riparian species. Both this survey and other studies have suggested that the physical and environmental characteristics of river walls are likely to influence their capacity to function as ecological habitat, for example, walls composed of more complex construction materials (brick and boulders) being more diverse than simpler structures (concrete and sheet piling). The opportunity exists to use river walls and other artificial structures (e.g., jetties) to improve habitat along urban rivers by installing walls which are designed to be more complex, or by adding modifications to existing walls. Some trial modifications, such as the addition of wall ledges and timber fenders to sheet piling, have been installed at Deptford Creek along the River Thames, and have so far greatly supported the colonization and development of plant communities. T he restoration possibilities of such modifications should be considered, and further development and rigorous testing of installations is required in urban rivers to make sound restoration recommendations.",2008
Conjugate turbulent natural convection in the roof enclosure of a heavy construction building during winter,natural convection; turbulent; conjugate; rectangular enclosure; heavy construction building; finite volume,INDOOR AIR-FLOW; HIGH RAYLEIGH NUMBER; SQUARE CAVITY; MODEL; PREDICTION; COMPUTATIONS; SIMULATION; RANS,"This paper presents the results of a study of conjugate turbulent natural convection inside a building attic in the shape of a rectangular enclosure bounded by realistic walls made from composite construction materials under winter day boundary conditions. The effects of cavity aspect ratio, Rayleigh number (Ra), depth of the external concrete beam, and external wall construction materials on the flow and heat transfer characteristics were the main focus of the investigation. The Shear stress transport k-omega turbulence model is implemented to calculate air-flow velocities and temperatures in a steady, turbulent, two-dimensional conjugate natural convection heat transfer inside an attic. The governing equations were solved by employing the line-by-line tri-diagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA) control volume method. For Ra ranging from 10(7) to 10(10), steady-state results of the streamline and temperature contours in addition to local and mean Nusselt numbers at all surfaces of the cavity were obtained. The results show that the values of Ra, attic aspect ratio and the composite wall materials have significant effect on the temperature and stream function contours within the enclosure, and the heat flux out of the room through the enclosure.

Bending behavior of ferrocement plates in sodium and magnesium sulfates solutions,ferrocement; flexural strength; sulfate attack,PERFORMANCE; RESISTANCE; CONCRETE,"To explore the potential uses of ferrocement as a construction material, the flexural performance of ferrocement plates under normal and aggressive environments is investigated. A series of thin mortar plate specimens were cast with varying number of mesh layers, and immersed in sodium and magnesium sulfate solutions, and tap water for a period of one year. The parameters investigated included (a) mesh wire spacing; (b) number of mesh layers (two and four); and (c) curing environment (tap water, sodium, and magnesium sulfate solutions). The test results indicated that, after one year of storage in sulfate solutions, the specimens reinforced with two layers of steel meshes, showed a significant increase in flexural strength accompanied with a noticeable decrease in ductility for specimens reinforced with medium and larger wire spacings, whereas most of the specimens reinforced with four layers showed some decrease in flexural strength and ductility compared to the specimens stored in tap water. All the plates tested showed no visible signs of significant deterioration, and exhibited typical flexural response with a varying number of fine hairline cracks occurring on the tension side of the plates.

The effects of cement/fly ash ratios on the volcanic slag aggregate lightweight concrete masonry units,volcanic slag; fly ash; lightweight aggregate concrete; masonry; compressive strength,FLY-ASH,"Masonry is one of the oldest construction materials, which was used for all kind of building applications especially for sufficient compressive strength in combination with good acoustic and thermal properties with low construction costs and solving some durability problems. The production of lightweight masonry block is generally performed by using a highly mechanised industry based on great automation and accuracy which is different from the other concrete types. This production has to match strict standards that describe properties specified for the products. Volcanic slag lightweight blocks (VSLB) are made of volcanic slag, cement and water, which are used in construction of non-load bearing infill walls and slabs. One of the most effective ways to reduce the dead load in a multi storey building is to lighten the weight of the structure. Therefore, natural lightweight aggregates, especially produced from the volcanic slag can be considered as a lightweight concrete aggregate in construction of buildings. In this research, control lightweight concrete (CLC) mixtures containing volcanic slag aggregates (VSA) with only normal portland cement (NPC) and finally with fly ash lightweight concrete (FALC) mixture containing 20% of FA as a replacement of the cement by volume were prepared and tested. In addition, no-fines aggregate was prepared from which the fine aggregate component of the matrix under I mm was entirely omitted and no-fines aggregate mixtures with NPC and FALC were compared with CLC and the effect of FA on the strength and unit volume weight was analysed. VSA samples were obtained from the quarries near Manisa City, Aegean Region of Turkey and after some crushing processes; samples were classified into specialized size fractions (0-4 mm as fine aggregates (FVSA), 4-8 mm, as coarse aggregates (CVSA) and 1-4 mm no fines aggregates). From those aggregates, several cubic samples were prepared by using different ratios of size fractions (60% fine and 40% coarse) including 5%, 8%, 10% cement by volume. FALC mixture containing 20% of FA as a replacement of the cement was prepared for analysing the unit weight and compressive strength results with demanding criterions of current standards. The research showed that, masonry units having desired properties can be produced by using fine and coarse VSA lightweight aggregate in the mixture with 10% cement by volume. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Nondestructive evaluation of material strength using depth-sensing indentation,nondestructive testing; depth-sensing indentation; elastic modulus; stiffness; hardness,ELASTIC-MODULUS; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; HARDNESS; NANOINDENTATION; CONCRETE; LOAD,"Successful application of any structural repair or strengthening method requires knowledge of strength and stiffness properties of the materials used in the construction. Depth-sensing indentation is a relatively new material testing method that significantly expands the capabilities of conventional hardness tests. Due to the mathematical complexity of the indentation problem, an analytical solution of the load-penetration depth (P-h) behavior is not available for most indenters. This study derives the P-h equations for a truncated cone indenter with arbitrary tip radius and included angle, which covers a wide range of geometries including the cylinder and the cone. A step by step procedure for material strength evaluation is introduced and validated using recorded indentation data. The analytical approach described in this paper can be used in evaluating the modulus of elasticity, stiffness and hardness of common construction materials without resorting to empirical equations.

The main analyzed parameters were the concrete compressive strength, the steel bar diameter, the concrete type and the test adequacy to provide a value for bond strength. Also, a comparison between Code provisions and empirical equations was done. According to the results, SCC and VC specimens presented similar behavior. The equations results showed a satisfactory approach compared to the experimental ones, but as expected Code provisions were very conservative. Based on the obtained results, it could be concluded that the same parameters adopted for VC can be extended for SCC.",2008
Materials design for sustainability through life cycle modeling of engineered cementitious composites,life cycle assessment; life cycle cost; fiber-reinforced composites; bridge design; environmental impacts; materials engineering,COSTS; CORROSION; CRACKING,"Evaluating and enhancing construction material sustainability requires a life cycle perspective of the structures in which they are used, since material properties and durability can have a profound effect on overall infrastructure performance. A framework is proposed to evaluate and enhance the design of ""greener"" materials that integrates material design, structural design, and life cycle modeling of the built system. This framework is applied to engineered cementitious composite materials, a family of high performance fiber-reinforced composites used as link slabs in a concrete bridge deck. Modeling results show incorporating waste materials, such as fly ash, should be pursued only if the material retains adequate durability for the structural application where it is used. Additionally, traffic congestion resulting from bridge deck construction and rehabilitation events dominates environmental and economic life cycle results, consuming the most energy, producing the largest amount of pollutants, and generating the greatest life cycle costs.",2008
Modelling of steel fibre reinforced concrete under high dynamic loadings,,IMPACT; TESTS; PLAIN,"For structural protection against extraordinary loads it is important to find construction materials that offer properties that are especially applicable to the problem. One of these materials is steel fibre reinforced concrete. However for high dynamic loads like from impact or detonation steel fibre reinforced concrete is not yet investigated sufficiently. This article describes a new empirical material model for the simulation of steel fibre reinforced concrete under high dynamic loadings. This material model also includes a damage model which describes the degradation of stiffness and strength in consequence of plastic (compaction and shear) strain. The model is implemented in a hydrocode, and validated by a multitude of contact detonation tests. From these results it could be shown that the numerical simulations carried out with the new steel fibre reinforced concrete model are capable to complement or to reduce the expensive and time-consuming experiments, respectively.",2008
Capillary absorption of water and n-decane by autoclaved aerated concrete,autoclaved aerated concrete; transport properties; microstructure; pore size distribution,POROUS BUILDING-MATERIALS; SORPTIVITY; MOVEMENT,"An autoclaved aerated concrete was one of three construction materials used in the round-robin study of hygral properties carried out in the European Commission funded Heat, Air and Moisture Standards Development [HAMSTAD] project (Roels S et al., Journal of Thermal Envelope and Building Science 2004 27 307-325). The material has fine micron-scale matrix porosity generated by the packing of thin tobermorite 11 angstrom plates; and coarse mm-scale aeration pores arising from the foaming of the wet mix. We treat the material as having a strongly bimodal pore size distribution. Capillary absorption does not obey simple t(1/2) kinetics. We report here the results of liquid uptake tests using both water and n-decane to investigate the cause of the inhibition behaviour. The transport properties are modelled in a Sharp Front analysis as a parallel combination of absorption into the coarse aeration pores and into the fine matrix pores. The aeration pores have weak capillary suction and absorption into these pores reaches capillary rise equilibrium during the test. The Sharp Front model is applied here for the first time separately to subsets of the total porosity. The matrix sorptivity of the autoclaved aerated concrete studied (density 450 kg m(-3), porosity 0.82) is about 0.23 mm min(-1/2). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2008

Simplified inverse method for determining the tensile properties of strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCC),,STRENGTH,"As an emerging advanced construction material, strain hardening cementitious composite (SHCC) has seen increasing field applications in recent years. Reliable data on tensile properties, including tensile strength and tensile strain capacity, are needed for structural design and for quality control. However, existing uniaxial tensile tests are relatively complicated and sometime difficult to implement, particularly for quality control purpose in the field. A simple inverse method based on beam bending test was presented by the authors (Qian and Li, 2007) for indirect determination of tensile strain capacity, aimed at quality control of SHCC in field applications. This paper extends this method to also determining the tensile strength based on beam bending test data. This proposed method (UM method) has been validated with uniaxial tensile test results with reasonable agreement. In addition, this proposed method is also compared with the Japan Concrete Institute (JCI) method. Comparable accuracy is found, yet the present method is characterized by much simpler experiment setup requirement and data interpretation procedure. Therefore, it is expected that this proposed method can greatly simplify the quality control of SHCCs both in execution and interpretation phases, contributing to the wider acceptance of this type of new material in field applications.",2008
Size and volume relationship of pore for construction materials,,CEMENT-BASED MATERIALS; MERCURY INTRUSION POROSIMETRY; SILICA FUME; POROSITY; CONCRETE; STRENGTH; PASTES; MICROSTRUCTURE; MORTARS,"A general relationship between cumulative pore volume and pore sizes as measured through mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and BSE image analysis technique is presented in this paper. From the results of the MIP study conducted on hardened cement paste, cement silica fume paste, cement silica fume sand mortar, brick, soil cement, and concrete, it is observed that a general relationship exists between applied pressure and intruded volume of mercury. This relationship closely follows the MMF (Morgan, Mercer and Flodin) model. The general relationship between pore sizes and intrusion volume in MIP is then derived from this relationship using Washburn's equation. A similar model is also observed to describe the relationship between cumulative volume and pore sizes obtained through BSE image analysis. The variations of the parameters namely median pore radius and dispersion coefficient (a measure of the spread of pore sizes), with silica fume content, ratio of water-to cementitious material and age are then discussed to demonstrate the utility of the model.",2008
Durability analysis of bamboo as concrete reinforcement,bamboo; durability; concrete; tensile strength; young's modulus; reinforcement,,"Durability is an actual challenge concerning all construction materials. If these materials are natural, the necessity to understand their long term behaviour is extremely important, because they are considered as having a low capacity to maintain their properties with time. Bamboo is a high strength material that can be used, in certain cases, as reinforcement in concrete. As concrete matrix has a high pH, many authors have discussed the decay of vegetal materials when used to reinforce cementitious matrix. This paper presents results of an experimental investigation made to evaluate bamboo durability to be used as concrete reinforcement. The durability was evaluated by changing the tensile strength and Young's Modulus of bamboo. Five hundred specimens were extracted from a Dencrocalamus giganteus bamboo culms and part of them was set into concrete prisms. A set up was developed to expose the specimens to wetting and drying cycles. Each exposure to wetting and drying lasted 24 h. The specimens without concrete were submitted to a calcium hydroxide solution and the samples with concrete were immersed in tap water. Tensile strength and Young's Modulus were measured after 7, 15, 30, 45 and 60 cycles. Results did not show any significant variation on these mechanical properties, attesting the durability of bamboo in these aggressive tests.",2008

Due to the negative side-effects of some of the conventional techniques, bacterial induced carbonate mineralization has been proposed as a novel and environmental friendly strategy for the protection of stone and mortar. This paper reports the effects of bacterial CaCO3 precipitation on parameters affecting the durability of concrete and mortar. Pure and mixed cultures of ureolytic bacteria were compared for their effectiveness in relation to conventional surface treatments. Bacterial deposition of a layer of calcite on the surface of the specimens resulted in a decrease of capillary water uptake and permeability towards gas. This bacterial treatment resulted in a limited change of the chromatic aspect of mortar and concrete surfaces. The type of bacterial culture and medium composition had a profound impact on CaCO3 crystal morphology. The use of pure cultures resulted in a more pronounced decrease in uptake of water, respectively less pronounced change in the chromatic aspect, compared to the use of mixed ureolytic cultures as a paste. The results obtained with cultures of the species Bacillus sphaericus were comparable to the ones obtained with conventional water repellents. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2008

Among all causes of deterioration (aging, chloride ingress, etc.) the action of live organisms has shown to be critical. in, for example, underground structures, sewage systems, and at-sea structures. This phenomenon is usually overlooked, in part, because in most cases live organisms accelerate other processes that may eventually lead to unacceptable structural performance or cause failure (e.g., corrosion, cracking). By the direct or indirect action, it has been estimated that biodeterioration-related structural problems cost billions of dollars a year in infrastructure maintenance and repair. The paper shows that for all major civil engineering materials, in the long term and under the appropriate environmental conditions, biodeterioration may severely affect infrastructure components and their ability to perform as designed. This is particularly relevant given the large amount of existing infrastructure that has been exposed to aggressive environments for long periods of time. This paper presents an overview of the activity of live organisms on three widely used construction materials: wood, concrete, and metals. A description of the main organisms that affect each material and the associated biodeterioration mechanisms are described. In addition, this paper discusses the uncertainties associated with modeling biodeterioration and outlines the main areas for further research.",2008
Thermal conductivity of cement composites containing rubber waste particles: Experimental study and modelling,rubber wastes; cement composite; rubber particles; thermal conductivity; modelling; self consistent technique,CONCRETE,"In this paper an investigation of the thermal conductivity of a lightweight construction material containing rubber waste particles, is presented. Measurements were carried out in a dry state using a transient plane source (TPS) technique. To determine the effect of the rubber particles ratio on the thermal conductivity of a cement composite, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% rubber particle ratios by volume as replacement to cement, were used. The experimental investigation revealed that the addition of rubber particles reduces the material unit weight, furthermore, thermal conductivity of the composite has been improved. The thermal insulating effect of rubber particles is most attractive and indicates a high and promising potential for development. Based on the self consistent method and assuming that the tri-phase composite consists of air, rubber particles and cement paste, thermal conductivity of the composite has been predicted as a function of the dry unit weight and formulations, using auto-coherent homogenisation model. The model requires the knowledge of rubber particles conductivity, which was experimentally measured using Horai and Simmons technique. A modelling application reveals good correspondence with the experimental results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2008
Study on strength and corrosion performance for steel embedded in metakaolin blended concrete/mortar,corrosion; metakaolin; strength; concrete; mortar; carbon steel,MORTARS,"It is an undeniable fact that concrete is the most widely used man-made construction material in the world today, and will remain so for decades to come. The popularity of concrete is largely due to the abundance of raw material, low manufacturing and maintenance cost, excellence in compression, and corrosion aspects, durability to weathering and fire hazards, versatility in forming various shapes and its unlimited structural applications in combination with steel reinforcement. However, the cement industry is also highly energy intensive, and the emission of carbon dioxide during cement manufacturing has created enormous environmental concerns. There has also been an increase in the number of incidents where concrete structures experienced severe deterioration in extreme environments. All these factors have contributed pressures from various quarters to reduce cement consumption, and to intensify research in exploring the possibilities of enhancing strength, durability and corrosion reduction through the use of pozzolans as supplementary cementing materials. The utilization of calcined clay in the form of metakaolin as a pozzolan for concrete has received considerable interest in recent years. The use of metakaolin as a mineral admixture for concrete is a well documented practice. Metakaolin is a quality enhancing pozzolan for concrete. It is manufactured from kaolin which is abundance in India and other parts of the country. In the present investigation mechanical property and corrosion behavior of carbon steel using metakaolin (5-20%) as partial replacement in ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Compressive strength, resistivity, ultra pulse velocity, open circuit potential, studies on water absorption, weight loss were studied. It was found that up to 15% replacement of metakaolin in OPC improves the mechanical properties of concrete. Corrosion of carbon steel improved by the addition of metakaolin up to 15%.

Economic comparison of concrete recycling: A case study approach,benefit; cost; economical; recycling; concrete; construction,HONG-KONG; WASTE,"Recycling of construction material helps saving the limited landfill space. Among various types of materials, concrete waste accounts for about 50% of the total waste generation. The current practice for dumping construction materials to landfills generates a significant quantity of waste from construction sites. Recycling concrete waste as recycled aggregate is one of the methods to reduce the concrete waste. Therefore, this paper investigates the economical considerations in recycling concrete waste. A comparative study on costs and benefits between the current practice and the concrete recycling method is examined. The study shows that it has a negative net benefit for the current practice while a positive net benefit for the concrete recycling method. Therefore, recycling concrete as aggregate for new concrete production can provide a cost-effective method for the construction industry and help saving the environment. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Stainless steel in concrete structures and in the fastening technique,,STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING,"This paper summarises the state of the art in the application of stainless steel in concrete structures as well as in the fastening technique. Fabrication and application of stainless steel in civil engineering has been undergoing development for many years. Today this material is available in different alloy compositions and has an excellent long-time resistivity in natural environments and in contact with wet construction materials, which offer a technically attractive and also economical approach for civil engineering, primarily for corrosion endangered bearing construction elements. The higher initial cost of using stainless steel can be justified on the basis that the increase in total project cost is small and is easily overtaken by the benefits of lower maintenance and repair costs. Actually stainless steel has been used in reinforced concrete and in fastening techniques for many years. The current concerns of research is the application of high-strength stainless steel in prestressed concrete structures.",2008
"Climatic effects and impacts of lakeshore bank designs on the activity of Chirixalus idiootocus in Yilan, Taiwan",ecological engineering; lakeshores; Chirixalus idiootocus; bank substrate,TOE-PADS; ADHESION; FROGS; TREEFROG,"Ecological engineering is the design of sustainable systems, consistent with ecological principles, which integrate human society with its natural environment for the benefit of both. In 2001, the government of Taiwan began to use ecological engineering as a therapy to nurse the damaged environment and found it worthwhile for further promotion for Taiwan's ecological environment. In recent years, the threat to amphibian animals is becoming more and more serious. The problem that concrete is mostly applied as a construction material on lakeshores in Taiwan has resulted in the obvious decrease of the habitats on which amphibian animals rely; hence, the need to develop the relevant design specification considering protecting the amphibian is imperative. Chirixalus idiootocus, an endemic species in Taiwan, is a small brown tree frog widely distributed in altitude ranging under 1500m [Chen, WS., 2003. 31 Frogs in Taiwan. Wild Bird Society of Taipei, pp. 62-63 (in Chinese)] with its unique breeding habitat [Kuramoto, M., Wang, C.S., 1987. A new Rhacophorid Treefrog from Taiwan, with comparisons to Chirixalus eiffingeri (Anura, Rhacophoridae). Copeia 4,931-942]. Since its uniqueness and importance, it has been a good indicator to reflect the environmental change. However, the understanding of this species is still too little and the methods to protect them have not been developed yet. The goal of this study was to understand the impacts of different substrates, gradients, and humidities of lakebank slopes on the activity of Chirixalus idiootocus. Experiments were carried out on the samplings collected in the field at Chang-Pi Lake. Among the experimental results obtained in this study, the ability of jump height and jump length were 12.93-14.03 cm and 38.15-39.19 cm, respectively. The male group (male) showed the best adhesive ability on awn grass (5.11 x 10(-2) N/g) at 45 degrees slope, and the (female) group performed the worst on sand (0.43 x 10(-2) N/g) at 75 degrees slope. Female frogs showed significant worse performance than male in jump height, jump length, and adhesive abilities, so were considered a target reference to design bank slopes based on their vulnerable behavioral capacity. With better comprehensive results obtained in this study, suggestions for the bank slope designs were thus proposed as a useful reference for ecological engineering promotion in Taiwan.

Propagation of ultra wide-band signals in lossy dispersive media,,,"Development of a channel model for continuous frequencies enables the analysis of communications in an ultra wide band wireless network in indoor environment including a single transmitting and a single receiving antenna. In this work we will describe a model taking into account multiple reflections which are a consequence of the room in which both transmitter and receiver are localized including wall, ceiling and floor reflections. Moreover, our model enables the analysis of a communication channel between adjacent and distant rooms, in those cases we take into account the wide band signal propagation through separating walls. The model developed is in the frequency domain and thus allows analyzing dispersive effects in transmission and reflection of ultra short pulses in UWB communications from building materials which the room is made of in accordance with their complex dielectric coefficients. For this purpose a library of material characteristics of various materials (concrete, reinforced concrete, plaster, wood, blocks, glass, stone and more) in the standard frequency domain for wireless networks was assembled. One of the important phenomena for UWB communications which our research has revealed is the in-wall multiple reflections resulting in echoes of the narrow pulse transmitted. Our model takes into account antenna polarization and beam shape, the effect of those traits are clearly distinguishable. Space-frequency theory of the propagation of an ultra-wide band radiation in dielectric media is presented. The transfer function of a slab of material is derived in the frequency domain, considering polarization losses via a complex permittivity. It is shown that absorptive and dispersive effects play a role in the transmission and reflection coefficients of the electromagnetic incident field. The theory is applicable in the analysis of broadband communication links operating in wireless local or personal area networks. In an indoor scenario, the construction material of the walls attenuates the propagating waves in a dispersive manner, causing amplitude and phase distortions in the transmitted signal.",2008

Albeit its abundance in most parts of the world, its potential as a construction material has not been fully realized. The major problems identified in attempts to utilize CS in construction include excessive wear, expansive behaviour, leaching and radioactivity. Thus, to date, the bulk of the CS utilization is limited to isolated cases of highway embankments, backfilling of mines, quarries and other surface tips, or in extreme cases subjected to marine and other disposal This paper reports on the scope of technological benefits of utilizing colliery spoil (CS) in low to medium strength concrete. There has been intermittent pursuance of the benefits of utilizing colliery spoil in the United Kingdom. However, there is still no well-accepted and/or positive feedback on any colliery-based technology and/or construction material, apart from that relating its use for bulk fill. This research was triggered by proximity of large supplies of both CS and slag in South Wales, UK, as well as the authors' interest in advances in sustainable construction. Two fractions of colliery spoil were mixed in equal proportions and used for concrete where the binder was PC, or novel binders comprising of either Wastepaper Sludge Ash (WSA) or WSA combined in equal proportions with Ground Granulated Blastfurnace Slag (GGBS), themselves industrial wastes or by-product materials. Compressive strength of compacted cube specimens was monitored for a period of up to 56 days of curing. Results indicate that the performance of systems incorporating CS and WSA were of very poor workability, but the resultant strength was within the low-to medium category usable for blinding concrete and or for use in bound granular fill or foundations.",2008
Ductility demand of compression yielding fiber-reinforced polymer-reinforced concrete beams,compression yielding; deformation; ductility; fiber-reinforced polymer; reinforced concrete,CONFINED CONCRETE; COLUMNS; MEMBERS,"The ductility of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) reinforced concrete (RC) members has been a major concern. Although significant efforts have been made in this research area, a general and effective way of increasing ductility has not been found A new structural scheme of providing ductility to RC members through the compressive yielding (CY) instead of the tensile yielding has recently been developed by the author The CY beams rely on the compressive deformation of the plastic hinge to achieve ductility. Therefore, adequate ductility of the RC members can be achieved without ductility demand on the tensile reinforcement. Because ductility of the CY beams comes from a small CY zone, the ductility demand on the material is excessive, which cannot be achieved by using conventional construction materials or structural measures. To study the ductility demand of the CY zone for the design of the CY beams, basic theory that relates the ductility demand of the CY zone to the design ductility of the member is developed in this work. A very effective CY mechanism of perforated block (P-block) that can satisfy the ductility demand of the CY zone is also developed and introduced.",2008
MONITORING EARLY-AGE BEHAVIOR OF CONCRETE RETAINING WALL BY FBG SENSORS IN YONGIN CONSTRUCTION SITE,early age shrinkage; FBG sensor; temperature compensation; retaining wall,,"Concrete is the construction material used widely in civil engineering field. The cracks of concrete are mainly caused by the uneven shrink in the early age especially hardening period. Hence, it is important to know concrete shrinkage and temperature varying during its early age. Firstly, the basic monitoring principle and merits of FBG sensor are introduced in this paper. Then FBG temperature sensor and strain sensor has been used to monitoring shrinkage and temperature of concrete retaining wall in construction site in its casting early age. The test results indicate that this monitoring method is a practical method for monitoring concrete at very early age. However, thermal shift of FBG strain senor should be eliminated. The monitoring technique used in this research could be extended to monitor shrinkage and temperature for mass concrete structure.",2008

In civil engineering it is primarily used for corrosion endangered bearing construction elements. This paper summarizes the state of the art in the application of stainless steel in reinforcement concrete as well the prestressed concrete structures. Fabrication and application of stainless steel in civil engineering has been undergoing development for many years. Today this material is available in different alloy compositions and adapted for the corrosive environments in different degrees. The experiences of the applications of stainless steel reinforcement are positive. It has a much higher corrosion resistance against chloride attack and can withstand much higher chloride contents compared to the normal carbon steel. The current concern of research is the application of high-strength stainless steel as tensile tendons in prestressed concrete structures. The majority of high-strength stainless steel products in building material market are cold-drawn austenitic steels, which have been used extensively as ropes and cables for bridges, towers and the wide-spanned constructions. Prestressed concrete structures are normally applied in wide-spanned constructions, e.g. bridges, multi-storey car park decks, tunnels and so on. These constructions usually are exposed to the aggressive environments (heavy loads, carbonation of concrete and high chloride concentration, etc.). The costs of maintenance and repairs of such kind of constructions are very high according the present experiences. Thus, the application of cold-drawn high-strength stainless steels as prestressing tendons in concrete is not only technically practicable but also an economical approach.",2008

Discovery of the mineral troilite (FeS) on the moon poses the question of extracting the sulfur for use as a lunar construction material. This would be an attractive alternative to conventional concrete as it does not require water. However, the viability of sulfur concrete in a lunar environment, which is characterized by lack of an atmosphere and extreme temperatures, is not well understood. Here it is assumed that the lunar ore can be mined, refined, and the raw sulfur melded with appropriate lunar regolith to form, for example, bricks. This study evaluates pure sulfur and two sets of small sulfur concrete samples that have been prepared using JSG-1 lunar stimulant and SiO2 powder as aggregate additions. Each set was subjected to extended periods in a vacuum environment to evaluate sublimation issues. Results from these experiments are presented and discussed within the context of the lunar environment. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.",2008
Environmentally Intelligent Integral Waterproofing and Corrosion Protection for Concrete,concrete; waterproof; admixture; hydrophobic; Cradle-to-Cradle; membrane-free,,"Hycrete Admixture (TM) is an additive to fresh concrete that makes the concrete waterproof and protects the steel reinforcement from corrosion. The material is a nanotechnology and is Cradle-to-Cradle certified as an environmentally intelligent product. Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world, but has a major flaw it's porous and absorbs water like a sponge (capillary absorption). Water and dissolved salts readily enter the concrete and corrode the steel reinforcement. The Hycrete material is unique because it is water based and yet repels other water. This occurs because the Hycrete material reacts with calcium in the concrete and takes on properties of a water repellant oil. Another end of the molecule bonds to polar particles, such as iron in the steel reinforcement and creates a monolayer of protection.",2008

Reinforcement corrosion has been widely reported to be one of the major durability problems, mainly when the rebar in the concrete is exposed to the chlorides, either contributed from the concrete ingredients or penetrated from the surrounding chloride-bearing environment. Carbonation of concrete or penetration of acidic gases into the concrete causes reinforcement corrosion. Besides these, factors related to the concrete quality, such as water/cement (w/c) ratio, cement content, impurities in the concrete ingredients, presence of surface cracks, etc. and those related to external environment, such as moisture, oxygen, humidity, temperature, bacterial attack, stray currents, etc., affect reinforcement corrosion.

The effect of urban evaporation on building energy demand in an arid environment,Scale-model; Urban climate modeling; Evaporative cooling; Thermal simulation,ATMOSPHERIC MODELS; EXCHANGE; FLUXES; CANOPY; SCHEME,"An open-air scaled urban surface (OASUS) was used to physically model the influence of urban structure on microclimatic conditions that affect the cooling requirements of buildings. The OASUS scale-model consists of an extensive urban-like building/street array constructed at an open site in the arid Negev region of southern Israel. Building rows are comprised of hollow concrete masonry blocks and have thermal and optical properties analogous to common local construction materials. Previous experiments with the scale-model were limited to ""dry"" conditions, with only negligible exchanges of latent heat. Considering that one of the main advantages of using the scale-model facility is to be able to control factors affecting microclimate, this study analyses the impact of adding moisture to the scaled ""streets"" between ""building"" rows, and gauges the impact of outdoor evaporative cooling on the energy demand of adjacent buildings. Measurements carried out during the summer month of August 2006 at the scale-model facility were used to obtain street canyon air temperatures, which in turn provided input for a dynamic energy simulation of indoor cooling loads in an actual building. The simulation model was calibrated with simultaneously measured data from a nearby residential building. Results suggest that the cooling factor in a street canyon is a direct function of the relative availability of moisture, with respect not only to horizontal area but also to the ""complete"" three-dimensional urban surface. In addition, simulation results of building energy demand show the importance of accounting for urban density when planning the disposition of vegetated surfaces for cooling purposes.

"Intensive, integrated, Biomass-based material and energy systems: Swedish experience",biomass; construction materials; energy systems; forest management; biofuels,WOOD; BALANCES,"Sustainable development of the built environment requires the production of increased quantities of construction materials and energy services, produced within the constraints of natural systems. This paper presents recent findings from Sweden on the intensive use of renewable forest resources within integrated material and energy systems. Production of materials for wood-framed construction uses less primary energy than for comparable reinforced concrete construction. Multiple wood-based products can be co-produced from the forest biomass, increasing the efficiency of raw material use. Biomass by-products from the entire wood product chain, including forestry, wood processing, construction and demolition, can be recovered for use as biofuel. The biofuel energy available over the life cycle of a wood-framed building is greater than the primary energy used to produce the materials. Increasing forest management intensity gives greater energy returns on management energy inputs. Intensive production of forest biomass is maintained by closing nutrient cycles through application of wood ash and nitrogen fertiliser.",2008

Peat-like deposits, organic muds and occasionally sand occur between the soil and the made ground. High aeolization of alluvial sediments allows relating their age to the Late Vistulian. The sediments were eroded and in the washout at first organic muds were deposited and subsequently sands. The lowest layer, radiocarbon-dated at 4510 +/- 60 uncal. years BP (Gd-12724), can be probably linked to climate moistening at the transition between the Holocene Atlantic and the Subboreal period. Pollen grains found in muds, black soil and peat-like deposits reflect the changes of local plant cover from dominated by pine woodlands ( at the transition between the Atlantic and the Subboreal period) to strongly deforested with single trees, meadows, small crop fields and gardens in the Medieval period. Palynological results describing the character of vegetation might have been influenced also by direct human activity on site, e. g. by storage of wood and branches ( then used as construction material or fuel), crops, fodder or waste. Microartefacts found in soil suggest metal processing in the vicinity during the Bronze Age. In the made ground, which has been accumulating since the 14th century, quartz, clay minerals and micas were identified together with fragments of bricks, concrete, ceramics, bones, slag, charcoal, organic matter, limestone fragments and metals. Horizons enriched in slag fragments are also high in metals: Fe, Mn and Pb, which reveal a twofold increase in metal processing activity.",2008
Experimental study on thermal strain creating in barrier sheet in waste landfill,barrier sheet; thermal strain measurement; model landfill site,,"Many types of barrier sheets are widely used in waste landfill in Japan. But these materials have high values of coefficient of thermal expansion comparing with other construction materials. This causes thermal stress in the barrier sheet when the circumstance temperature changes. Sometimes, it brings to serious problem such as tearing of sheet or failure of anchorage. So, it is very important to know how much the strain/stress is created due to the change of circumstance temperature. The authors constructed large model landfill site surrounding a bank with a height of 5m, and whole area of 1,600 m(2). Many types of barrier sheets, HDPE, LDPE, TPU and TPO were placed on the slope. Strain gages were pasted on the surface of the barrier sheets. Thermo-couples were also pasted to measure temperature of the barrier sheets. These data were automatically stored into the data-logger. Measurements were conducted for 2 years off and on. Measured strain level changed corresponding to the change of the temperature. The relationship between the temperature and the strain level of each barrier sheet were obtained. It is also measured in the corner and near the concrete structure. And it is found that strains are created isotropic even in the corner of the model landfill site.",2008

One of the main difficulties is to develop a very flexible platform, which is able to move and inspect horizontal and vertical surfaces safely, and which is fast and cost-efficient. The purpose of this paper is to present a climbing robot designed with these attributes in mind. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the Climbing RObot with Multiple Sucking Chambers for Inspection, which is designed for inspection of concrete walls. The propulsion system consists of three omnidirectional-driven wheels for high maneuverability. The adhesion is performed by a vacuum system of seven controllable vacuum chambers and one large reservoir chamber. Pressure sensors and valves are integrated for controlling, which allows fast reaction on changing conditions. Findings - The comparison of simulated results and a simple prototype indicates that the developed physical model is exact enough to estimate the efficiency of the proposed adhesion mechanism. The propulsion system has been tested extensively and allows high maneuverability on reasonably flat ground.

Flexural behavior of manufactured sand as fine aggregate for future construction,,,"Sand, as one of the most accessible natural resources, has been used since earliest days of civilization, mostly as a construction material. Sand operations are versatile and useful in terms of development potential. Increase in population has resulted in the ever increasing demand for sand and there fore shortages in and near urban and industrialized areas, which usually represent major markets, are expected to increase. Hence, in present scenario it is necessary to find the most suitable substitute for sand, which is easy to produce and has all the required qualities for use in concrete. Manufactured sand is one among such materials to replace river sand, which can be used as an alternative fine aggregate in mortars and concrete. The present investigation is intended to emphasize the use of manufactured sand as fine aggregate in place of natural sand in making structural grade concrete. To obtain the set objectives of the investigation, three grades of concrete viz; M25, M30 and M35 have been considered. The concrete mix cases of the above mentioned grades have been considered for both natural sand and manufactured sand respectively. An experimental study was undertaken to find out the effect of manufactured sand on properties of hardened concrete. A total of 12 RC beam specimens of size 150 mm x 230 mm x 1500 mm were cast for testing. The results have been compared for the specimens made with natural fine aggregate. The test results of these investigations have been found optimistic and quite encouraging. Further the results show that the reinforced concrete beams with manufactured sand concrete indicated higher ultimate moment carrying capacity than that of conventional concrete beams for the above grades of concrete.",2008
Enhancing Concrete Strength and Thermal Insulation Using Thermoset Plastic Waste,concrete; mortar; recycling; solid waste; strength; tests; thermal insulation; thermoset plastics,,"Structural concrete is the most frequently used construction material in the world because of its known advantageous characteristics. However, concrete has some limitations, such as its low tensile strength, low strength-to-weight ratio and moderate thermal insulation. Improving these characteristics was the aim of a laboratory-based investigation into the behavior of concrete made in the presence of ground melamine-formaldehyde (MF) thermosetting plastic waste as a sand replacement. The MF is a cross-linked thermoset polymer that cannot be recycled or reprocessed, presenting a serious solid waste disposal problem. The laboratory-based program included tests of tensile and compressive strengths, unit weight and thermal insulation characteristics. The tests were carried out on concrete and mortar with various water-to-cement (w/c) ratios, and sand was replaced by MF at different percentages that ranged from 0% to 60%. The results indicated that replacing sand with MF resulted in a lighter-weight concrete with improved characteristics. In general the strengths were increased as the percentage of MF was increased to reach maximum values at approximately 30% MF. In comparison with control specimens without MF, the strength/weight ratio of concrete was increased by up to 47% and the tensile strength of mortar was increased up to 16%. With regards to thermal insulation, a drop in temperature up to 30% was recorded in specimens with 60% MF. In conclusion, this investigation showed that the addition and reuse of MF in concrete mixes significantly improved the mechanical and thermal characteristics of concrete. This would be an effective approach when added to other protection methods of solid waste, as it addresses the specific waste of MF.",2008
"Structural reliability of the ""Palazzo della Civilta Italiana"" in Rome EUR",,,"The ""Palazzo della Civilta Italiana"" is a monumental building characterized by structural system made of reinforced concrete frames (cast in situ) and composite floors (reinforced concrete and hollow bricks), following a construction technology quite common in Italy. The floors are characterised by relatively large spans of about 10.0 meters. The construction took place between 1939 and 1943, presumably according to the construction code of the time published in 1939. The authors have coordinated a comprehensive experimental campaign aimed at the identification of the characteristics of the construction materials and members as well as the identification of possible damages. Based upon the experimental results a number of analytical and numerical investigations have been developed in order to identify the structural actions and deformations. Fortunate circumstances have allowed the authors to have at hand the original technical drawings of the structural designer. This has proved crucial in order to develop grounded reliability analysis for the building structure in its present state, which still sees the building in its ""original"" configuration (no substantial intervention of structural retrofit or rehabilitation have indeed been implemented so far). In order to assess the seismic risk of the building structure a specific hazard analysis (PSHA) was developed to obtain a more precise probabilistic characterization of the expected seismic action (than that suggested for new building construction). The two major reliability issues identified though the analysis are relate to: (a) the load bearing capacities of the floors (the live load of the original design are inferior to those required nowadays to guarantee a sufficiently ""flexible"" use of the spaces), and (b) the seismic vulnerability of the building original structure. The authors have developed simple (non invasive) structural solutions in order to bring the ""Palazzo"" to the level of structural safety required by current standards. The strengthening and retrofit design encompasses the use of seismic dampers to be inserted in a central ""light well"" (already present in the building) and of ""preloaded"" steel beams to be placed underneath the floors.",2008
Investigation of Performance of Superplasticizing Admixtures Used in Hungarian Building Industry,superplasticizing admixture; few table test; compressive strength,,"Concrete is the strongest candidate to be the most important construction material of the 21st century.

FIBER REINFORCED CONCRETE FOR SUSTAINABLE AND INTELLIGENT INFRASTRUCTURE,,WATER PERMEABILITY; CARBON,"Civil infrastructure around the world is in a state of Litter disrepair and significant efforts are needed on the part of all stakeholders to render Our failing infrastructure back to a serviceable and safe state. The root of the problem is at the apparent lack of durability in our construction materials, inability on part of the owners to provide timely maintenance, absence of advanced condition assessment tools and lack of long-lasting, cost effective repair materials and technologies. This paper will present data to support the argument that fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) is an ideal material for achieving these goals. The paper introduces a new class of bio-inspired FRCs carrying natural Cellulose fibers that are recyclable, biodegradable and highly sustainable. The paper also discusses fiber reinforced concrete materials carrying carbon fibers and carbon nano-tubes that possess sensing abilities.

Bamboo: Low cost and energy saving construction materials,,,"In order to use bamboo on a large scale as an engineering material, economically feasible, with a possible industrialization, it becomes necessary to study scientifically the plantation, harvesting, curing and treatment processes. After this initial stage, a complete statistical and probabilistic analysis of the physical, mechanical and micro-structural properties of whole bamboo culms of different species should be carried out. Since 1979, the research programs at PUC-Rio, supervised by the author, were mainly concerned with establishing the engineering properties of some of the existing bamboo in Brazil and creating new structural elements using bamboo for civil and rural construction. The present paper has as its main objective to present the physical and mechanical properties of whole bamboo culms in addition to determining the functionally graded composite properties using data processing imagine of the studied bamboo. The bamboo species studied were Dendrocalamus giganteus take from the PUC-Rio and Guadua angustifolia, take from the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro, Guadua tagoara and Guadua angustifolia taken from of Guarulhos in the state of Sao Paulo and Phyllostachys heterocycla pubescens (Moso) and Phyllostachys bambusoides (Matake) from the city of Presidente Prudente in the state of Sao Paulo.

Bamboo in construction,Bamboo; construction; durability; jointing,,"Bamboo is one of the oldest and most versatile building materials with many applications in the field of construction, particularly in developing countries. It is strong and lightweight and can often be used without processing or finishing. Bamboo constructions are easy to build, resilient to wind and even earthquake forces, and readily repairable in the event of damage. Associated products such as bamboo based panels and bamboo reinforced concrete also find applications in the construction process. In spite of these clear advantages, the use of bamboo has been largely restricted to temporary structures and lower grade buildings due to limited natural durability, difficulties in jointing, a lack of structural design data and exclusion from building codes. The diminishing wood resource and restrictions imposed on felling in natural forests, particularly in the tropics, have focused world attention on the need to identify a substitute material which should be renewable, environmentally friendly and widely available. In view of its rapid growth, a ready adaptability to most climatic and edaphic conditions and properties superior to most juvenile fast growing wood, bamboo emerges as a very suitable alternative. However, in order to exploit fully the potential of bamboo as a construction material, development effort should be directed at the key areas of preservation, jointing, structural design and codification.",2008
Environmental friendly reinforced retaining wall by using traditional stone masonry,,,"The ancient civil structures had been constructed by using natural resources such as soil, stone or timber. In modem structures, those construction materials have been replaced by artificial materials such as concrete, steel or plastic, and such change has contributed to rather speedier and larger scale construction.

Extensive concrete and shotcrete systems for the world's longest tunnel (Gotthard base tunnel-56km),,,"Concrete is one of the decisive construction materials, also for the AlpTransit Gotthard Tunnel. The client has many requirements, and many are the solution possibilities that concrete systems can offer. Cement producers and concrete admixture manufacturers have been challenged to design and test jointly concrete systems for cast and sprayed concrete. The testing operation followed the scenario laid out by the Gotthard AlpTransit Project management's instructions ""Testing system for concrete mixes."" Various supplier teams have applied for the concrete systems for sections Amsteg/Erstfeld, section Sedrun and/or sections Bodio/Faido and have also followed through with the tests. As was to be expected, the rate of failed mixes matched the level of the requirements. Thanks to this system, it was nevertheless possible to test complete concrete systems for all sections and to get them approved. The joint ventures tendering for the contracts were allowed to include only approved mix designs in their bids. Workability and durability are of paramount importance for cast and sprayed concrete mixes. Durability is influenced by the chosen mix design where binder concept and well-defined water content, i.e., impermeability, are determinant. Aggregates for AlpTransit are to be considered as given. The concrete mix design also determines workability. Because ambient conditions and also requirements with respect to workability are subjected to change, it is necessary that the mix designs include control measures. The choice and number of components for the concrete systems (cement, additives and admixtures) allow adaptation to changing conditions. For AlpTransit such adaptive measures must meet very strict requirements.",2008
Hemp and lime in sustainable construction,hemp; lime; sustainability; construction,,"Sustainability is the issue of our generation and is becoming a critical factor in the design, and construction Of buildings. When hemp is mixed with lime it produces a concrete like bio-composite, with the properties of good insulation, thermal inertia, hygroscopic performance and good vapour permeability. The combining of hemp shiv with a lime based binder results in the non-structural construction material often referred to as 'Hemcrete'. This is typically cast around a timber frame to provide an all in one wall structure. This solid, breathing wall is finished with permeable external cladding such as lime render.

Numerical assessment of saw-cutting: The influence on stress development and cracking,,,"Joints are placed in Jointed Plain Concrete Pavements (JPCP) to control random cracking that is caused by the residual stresses that develop due to thermal, hygral, or hydration effects. Although the concept behind the need for saw-cutting is relatively straightforward, determining the time and depth of the saw-cut can be complicated in practice. While saw-cutting is widely done in practice, it is usually based on non-scientific principles. This study used finite element analysis to simulate the effect of saw-cutting on the stress development and cracking behavior of concrete pavements. The interaction between the environmental conditions, properties of the constituent materials, mixture proportions, mechanical properties, and timing of construction operations was assessed in terms of the rate of concrete property development and stress development. This approach presents an exciting step forward that will enable concrete pavement construction practices to be optimized for a given series of construction materials and environmental conditions.",2008
"Heat Transfer Characteristics of Compound Wall from OSB, Low Density Strawboard and Gypsumboard",OSB; low density strawboard; heat transfer characteristics,,"The thermal transport properties of low density strawboard and the compound wall from Oriented Strandboard(OSB), Low Density Strawboard(LDSB) and Gypsumboard were tested. The unsteady heat transfer characteristic of the compound wall was analyzed with the method of Response Coefficient. The indoor environment of the build from the compound wall was investigated and compared with the house from common construction materials, so that the heat transfer characteristics and the energy-efficient performance of the compound wall can be evaluated. The results show that Low density strawboard is one kind of ideal heat insulation material for buildings. The compound wall has better performance to prevent the periodic thermal wave from propagating across the wall than the brick and the aerated concrete.",2008
BLAST FRAGMENTS PREDICTION - CURRENT APPROACHES AND CHALLENGES,Fragments; Blast; Probabilistic distribution; Empirical; Theoretical and numerical,HIGH-VELOCITY IMPACT; HIGH-STRAIN RATES; DYNAMIC FRAGMENTATION; BRITTLE MATERIALS; CONCRETE; FRACTURE; MODEL; ROCK; SIMULATION; FAILURE,"Debris generated from damaged structure components under blast loading imposes a great threat to occupants of building structures. The current practice in predicting blast induced debris is mainly based on empirical relations established using field blast test data. Because the inherent structural conditions such as dimensions, material properties, boundary conditions and surrounding environments vary from structure to structure and are usually different from the model structures tested in the field, these empirical relations do not necessarily give reliable predictions of blast debris in an explosion event. Many researchers have developed theoretical and numerical models to predict fragmentation process and fragment distributions of construction materials. The theoretical models are based primarily on the theory of continuum damage mechanics and/or fracture mechanics, and energy and momentum balance principles. The numerical models include finite element approach with interface constraints, discrete element model, meshfree model, lattice model and applied element method. Because the dynamic fragmentation process of construction materials such as masonry and concrete under blast loading is very complex, all these models have intrinsic difficulties for practical application to predict blast generated debris. This paper will conduct a review of the current methods, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. The challenges to develop an efficient and reliable method to predict fragmentation process and fragment distribution will be outlined. Since fragmentation process depends on the dynamic material properties, commonly used material models for concrete and masonry will also be introduced. Finally, the recently developed models by the authors to predict concrete and masonry wall damage and probabilistic fragment distributions will be briefly discussed.",2008

A new natural analogue study of the interaction of low-alkali cement leachates and the bentonite buffer of a radioactive waste repository,,SERPENTINIZATION; ORIGIN; OMAN,"Bentonite plays a significant barrier role in many radioactive waste repository designs, where it has been chosen due to its favourable properties such as plasticity, swelling capacity, colloid filtration, low hydraulic conductivity and its stability in relevant geological environments. However, bentonite is unstable at high pH meaning that it could lose its favourable properties if interacted with hyperalkaline leachates from concrete construction materials (e.g. tunnel liners, grouts, etc.), seals and plugs and/or cementitious wastes in a repository. This fact has forced several national programmes to assess alternative construction and sealing materials such as low alkali cements. Recently, it has been assumed that the lower pH (typically pH 10-11) leachates of such cements will degrade bentonite to a much lesser degree than 'standard' OPC-based cement leachates (generally with an initial pH>13). To date, few laboratory or in situ URL (underground rock laboratory) data are available to support the use of low alkali cements in conjunction with bentonites, partly because of the very slow kinetics involved. Consequently, a new project has focussed on finding an appropriate natural analogue site to provide long-term supporting data which will avoid the kinetic constraints of laboratory and URL experiments. Early results have identified an initial, very promising site at Mangatarem in the Philippines, where a quarry excavating bentonite and zeolites is found in the sedimentary carapace of the Zambales ophiolite. In the immediate vicinity of the quarry, ophiolite-derived hyperalkaline groundwaters are present and further field work (including geophysics surveys and borehole drilling) are now being planned to assess regional bentonite/hyperalkaline groundwater interaction. This paper presents an overview of the current status of the project and assesses the relevance of the study to improving understanding of low-alkali cement leachate/bentonite interaction.",2008

Use of recycled plastic in concrete: A review,,MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; SCRAP; MANAGEMENT; PRODUCTS; POLYPROPYLENE; CONSTRUCTION; TECHNOLOGY; COMPOSITES; AGGREGATE; OPTIONS,"Numerous waste materials are generated from manufacturing processes, service industries and municipal solid wastes. The increasing awareness about the environment has tremendously contributed to the concerns related with disposal of the generated wastes. Solid waste management is one of the major environmental concerns in the world. With the scarcity of space for landfilling and due to its ever increasing cost, waste utilization has become an attractive alternative to disposal. Research is being carried out oil the utilization of waste products in concrete. Such waste products include discarded tires, plastic, glass, steel, burnt foundry sand, and coal combustion by-products (CCBs). Each of these waste products has provided a specific effect on the properties of fresh and hardened concrete. The use of waste products in concrete not only makes it economical, but also helps in reducing disposal problems. Reuse of bulky wastes is considered the best environmental alternative for solving the problem of disposal. One such waste is plastic, which could be used in various applications. However, efforts have also been made to explore its use in concrete/asphalt concrete. The development of new construction materials using recycled plastics is important to both the construction and the plastic recycling industries. This paper presents a detailed review about waste and recycled plastics, waste management options, and research published oil the effect of recycled plastic oil the fresh and hardened properties of concrete. The effect of recycled and waste plastic oil bulk density, air content, workability, compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, impact resistance, permeability, and abrasion resistance is discussed in this paper.

SIMULATION AND DIRECTING MEASURES IN WOOD UTILIZATION,energy consumption; sustainable development; simulation; wood utilization; directing measures,,"Contemporary energy consumption cannot have a stable structure over the long term. Average energy consumption in the EU in 2002 was at a level of 3,72 tons of oil equivalent per capita. In spite of the declaration of numerous programs of energy consumption reduction, total energy consumption has been increasing in the EU since the year 1992 by 2-3% every five years. One of the development programs in the sphere of construction looks to increasing the use of wood as a construction material. This deals with a range of wood uses for higher generation as substitution for steel constructions and the replacement of constructions with high energy consumption (concrete, reinforced concrete, brick, insulation materials etc.). The article deals with the creation of a model for strategic change assessment and its evaluation. On the basis of the described model different directing measures are proposed.",2008
Influence of thixotropy on pressures required during pumping of concrete,concrete; pumping; thixotropy,,"Concrete is a very popular construction material, which can be regarded as a suspension of solids of several orders of magnitude, suspended in water. From a rheological point of view, the fresh fluid concrete mostly obeys the Bingham law, showing a yield stress and a plastic viscosity. Due to the presence of cement, a permanent process of coagulation and dispersion occurs, causing the concrete to be thixotropic. This paper describes the influence of thixotropy on the measured pressure losses during high speed pumping. Apparently, the concrete becomes more fluid with increasing discharge, increasing the risk for the loss of internal stability, which can lead to a very low quality product.",2008
Prediction and measurement of the elastic modulus of the RCC: Case of the low cement proportioning,Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC); granular materials; Elasticity; Elastic modulus; models,,"The Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC), which is presented as an evolutionary technology for a large diversity of applications (Dams, roads...), is considered, like conventional concretes and other construction materials, as an elastic material. The RCC in pavement supports many stresses which involve deformations and reciprocally. The knowledge of the relation between strength and deformation, for a material such as the RCC, presents a capital interest for the structural design of rigid pavements. The authors treat, in this work the experimental evaluation and the estimation, through a model, of the Young's elastic modulus E of the RCC for pavement manufactured with low cement proportioning. This work includes experimental measurements of the elastic modulus E on standardized specimens prepared according to the method of the French National Project ""BaCaRa"".

Economic comparison of recycling over-ordered fresh concrete: A case study approach,benefit; cost; recycling; concrete; concrete reclaimer; construction,,"Recycling of construction material helps save the limited landfill space. Among various types of materials, concrete waste accounts of about 50% of the total waste generation. Current off-site practices for ready mixed concrete batching plant generate a significant quantity of fresh concrete waste through over-order from construction sites. The use of concrete reclaimer is one of the methods to reclaim these concrete wastes, which separates coarse aggregate, sand and cement from fresh concrete. Although there are some concrete producers in Hong Kong providing concrete reclaimers in their plants, they are only used to flush and dilute the cement slurry from the concrete, which will still be ultimately send all to dumping areas. The reluctance of most concrete producers in reclaiming aggregate from the concrete waste is due to its high cost of treatment and lack of space around the plant. Therefore, this paper puts forth a scheme of economical considerations in recycling over-ordered concrete by concrete reclaimer. A comparative study on costs and benefits between the current practices and the proposed recycling plan is examined. The study shows that the costs of the current practices in dumping over-ordered fresh concrete waste to landfill areas are double that of the proposed aggregate recycling plan. Therefore, the adoption of concrete reclaimer in recycling the over-ordered fresh concrete can provide a cost-effective method for the construction industry and help saving the environment.

Fiber reinforced concrete under high dynamic loading,,HIGH-STRAIN RATES; FRACTURE ENERGY; STRENGTH; TENSION,"High dynamic actions like high velocity impact loads and blast loads due to detonations usually represent exceptional or accidental loads against structures. But in the course of safety policy thoughts their consideration in structural engineering gains in importance. Besides the consideration in design of structural members, there is also a need for development and optimization of new construction materials against high dynamic loading. Thereby the addition of fibers to concrete has been proved as essential to secure adequate protection. Against this background the present article deals with the behavior of fiber reinforced concrete subjected to high dynamic loads. Starting with a brief description of basics, the Hopkinson-Bar-tests, which have been carried out to gain information concerning the dynamic characteristics of fiber reinforced concrete will be presented.

Physico-mechanical properties and water absorption of cement composite containing shredded rubber wastes,rubber waste particles; lightweight cement composite; physico-mechanical properties; strain capacity; capillary water absorption; sorptivity,CONCRETE; PARTICLES,"The main objective of this study was to investigate the potential utilisation of rubber waste in cementitious matrix, as fine aggregates, to develop lightweight construction materials. Composites containing different amounts of rubber particles, as partial replacement to cement by volume, were characterised by destructive and non-destructive testing. Five designated rubber contents varying from 10% to 50% by volume were used. The 28-days physical, mechanical and hydraulic transport properties of the cement composite were determined. Analyses included dry unit weight, elastic dynamic modulus, compressive and flexural strengths, strain capacity, and water absorption. Test results of the physico-mechanical behaviour indicated that the increase in rubber content decreases the sample unit weight with a large reduction in the strengths and elastic modulus values of the composites. Results have only shown that the introduction of rubber particles significantly increases the strain capacity of the materials. However, rubbers into cement paste enhances the toughness of the composite. Although the mechanical strengths were reduced, the composite containing 50% of rubber particles satisfies the basic requirement of lightweight construction materials and corresponds to ""class II"", according to the RILEM classification. Test-results of the hydraulic transport properties revealed that the addition of rubber particles tends to restrict water propagation in the cement matrix and reduces water absorption of the composite. The decrease of the sorptivity-value is favourable to the durability of the specimen structures. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007
Using biomass for climate change mitigation and oil use reduction,biomass; climate change initigation; oil use reduction,GREENHOUSE-GAS BALANCES; DETACHED HOUSES; ENERGY; TECHNOLOGIES; CONCRETE; SYSTEMS; SWEDEN; WOOD,"In this paper, we examine how an increased use of biomass could efficiently meet Swedish energy policy goals of reducing carbon dioxide (C0(2)) emissions and oil use. In particular, we examine the trade-offs inherent when biomass use is intended to pursue multiple objectives. We set up four scenarios in which up to 400 PJ/year of additional biomass is prioritised to reduce C0(2) emissions, reduce oil use, simultameously reduce both C0(2) emission and oil use, or to produce ethanol to replace gasoline. Technologies analysed for using the biomass include the production of electricity, heat, and transport fuels, and also as construction materials and other products. We find that optimising biomass use for a single objective (either C0(2) emission reduction or oil use reduction) results in high fulfilment of that single objective (17.4 Tg C/year and 350 PJ oil/year, respectively), at a monetary cost of 130-330 million epsilon/year, but with low fulfilment of the other objective. A careful selection of biomass uses for combined benefits results in reductions of 12.6 Tg C/year and 230 PJ oil/year (72% and 67%, respectively, of the reductions achieved in the scenarios with single objectives), with a monetary benefit of 45 million epsilon/ year. Prioritising for ethanol production gives the lowest C0(2) emissions reduction, intermediate oil use reduction, and the highest monetary cost. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007
Synthesis and applications of unsaturated polyester resins based on PET waste,PET waste; glycolysis; unsaturated polyester resins; construction material,RECYCLED PET; POLY(ETHYLENE-TEREPHTHALATE),"Three types of unsaturated polyester resins were synthesized from the glycolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste, considering environment, cost and properties for their applications. These synthesized unsaturated polyester resins could be used for various construction processes and materials such as no dig pipelining (NDR-1), pultrusion (PLR-1) and polymer concrete (PCR-1). PET was taken from common soft-drink bottles, and ethylene glycol (EG), diethylene glycol (DEG) and MPdiol glycol mixtures were used for the depolymerization at molar ratios. The glycolyzed PET 1(st) products (oligomers) were reacted with maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride and dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) (especially for polymer concrete) to form unsaturated polyester resins with mixed styrene. The lab scale (1-5 kg) and pilot plant scale-up tests (200 kg) were experimented to evaluate the processing characteristics, viscosity, acid number and curing behaviors. The main properties such as hardness, flexural strength, tensile strength, heat distortion temperature, elongation, and chemical resistance were determined based on the various uses of the three resins. Furthermore, the applicability and the properties of these developed resins were verified through many real application tests.",2007
Manufacture of high heat conductivity resistant clay bricks containing perlite,heat conductivity; expanded perlite; lightweight material; clay brick,COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; CONCRETE; POROSITY; WALL,"Different methods have been investigated for achieving heat insulation in the buildings. Manufacturing of high heat conductivity resistant construction materials is an important part of these research efforts. Perlite is an extremely useful material for heat insulation and 70% of the world reserves are located in Turkey. Nearly 65% of the perlite produced today is consumed by the construction industry. Its thermal, lightness, and acoustic insulation properties make perlite an excellent material to be used as lightweight aggregate in brick manufacturing. High heat resistant brick can be produced by adding perlite into the clay in conventional brick manufacturing. In this investigation perlite of Eskisehir region and clay were collated and fired to form high heat conductivity resistant material. Binding materials such as cement, gypsum, lime, bitumen and clay were used for manufacturing perlite brick. Bricks in standard sizes manufactured at different perlite-clay ratios and unit weight, compressive strength, volume reduction and heat conductivity values were obtained. Then the mixture with the best combination of the properties was deter-mined and cost optimization was described. Results were examined according to combination properties, and specialties of perlite bricks were determined at various weights. As a result, the best mixture was determined as the one containing 30% perlite. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007
Monitoring of concrete building construction,monitoring; strain gage; concrete construction; collapse,CALCIUM ALUMINATE CEMENT; HYDRATION,"The collapses of concrete structures cause property loss, construction delays, and, more importantly, loss of human life. It is unlikely that a concrete construction failure is caused by a single factor. Presumably, a major cause combined with several secondary factors, such as rainfall, temperature fluctuations, uploading of formworks and rebars, and concrete placing, will have catastrophic consequences. This research tries to clarify the causes that increase the deformation of and stresses upon concrete members during construction stages. The marked strain increases, identified by daily readings of embedded gages, are due to either environmental changes or construction factors. The measured data shows that without unexpected external loadings, large rainfall causes a remarkable increase in the strain and stress on a concrete structure during construction. Other secondary factors affecting the concrete are: uploading of construction materials, removal of the support structure and formworks, change of temperature, and concrete placing. The results obtained by this study offer some precautions for in situ concrete construction.",2007
Carbon-neutral economy with fossil fuel-based hydrogen energy and carbon materials,hydrogen; infrastructure; carbon dioxide,,"Hydrocarbon fossil fuels can be considered as hydrogen ores for CO2-free energy, and carbon ores for carbonaceous construction materials. Hydrogen fuel can be extracted from fossil fuels by decarbonization, and used as an energy resource. The carbon byproduct can be used as a versatile construction material. Carbon materials would sequester carbon, and replace CO2-generating steel and concrete. Approximate comparison of the global consumption of energy and construction materials suggests a rough mass balance of energy and materials markets. The cost of foregoing the carbon energy content as a fuel can be easily offset by the value of the carbon-based construction material. The nature and properties of carbon materials and conventional infrastructural materials are compared. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007
Enhancing the performance of pre-cast concrete blocks by incorporating waste glass - ASR consideration,recycled aggregates; recycled glass; ASR; concrete paving blocks,,"There is a growing interest of using recycled crushed glass (RCG) as an aggregate in construction materials especially for non-structural applications. Although the recycled crushed glass is able to reduce the water absorption and drying shrinkage in concrete products due to its near to zero water absorption characteristics, the potential detrimental effect of using glass due to alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in cementitious materials is a real concern. The extent of ASR and its effect on concrete paving blocks produced with partial replacement of natural aggregates by crushed glass cullet are investigated in this study. This study is comprised of two parts. The first part quantified the extent of the ASR expansion and determined the adequate amount of mineral admixtures that was needed to reduce the ASR expansion for concrete paving blocks prepared with different recycled crushed glass contents using an accelerated mortar bar test in accordance with ASTM C 1260 (80 degrees C, 1 N NaOH solution). In the second part, concrete paving blocks were produced using the optimal mix proportion derived in the first part of this study and the corresponding mechanical properties were determined. It was found from the mortar bar test that the incorporation of 25% or less RCG induced negligible ASR expansion after a testing period of 28 days. For mixes with a glass content of higher than 25%, the incorporation of mineral admixtures such as pulverized fuel ash and metakaolin was able to suppress the ASR expansion within the stipulated limit but the results need to be confirmed by other test methods such as the concrete prism test. The study concluded that the optimal mix formulation for utilizing crushed waste glass in concrete paving blocks should contain at least 10% PFA by weight of the total aggregates used.

Shape optimization of steel reinforced concrete beams,reinforced concrete; simply supported beams; uniformly distributed load; limit state design; shape; optimization,DESIGN,"Steel reinforced concrete is perhaps the most versatile and widely used construction material. The versatility is attributed to mouldability of concrete to any conceivable shape. The inherent property of cracking of concrete is the reason for its low tensile strength and hence the design approach of RCC sections in flexure adopts the cracked section theory where in concrete in tension zone is ignored. Means, modes and methods of exploitation of concrete strength by conceiving shapes other than rectangular whereby ineffective concrete in tension zone is reduced and incorporated in compression zone where it is effective needs consideration. Shape optimization of beams is attempted in this analytical investigation employing Sequential Unconstrained Minimization Technique (SUMT). The results clearly show that trapezoidal beams happen to be less costlier than their rectangular counterparts, their usage needs serious reconsideration by the designers.",2007
Strength and serviceability performance of beams reinforced with GFRP bars in flexure,GFRP; flexure; crack width; deflection,CONCRETE BEAMS; BEHAVIOR; FRP,"Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) rebars have been identified as all alternate construction material for reinforcing concrete during the last decade primarily due to its strength and durability related characteristics. These materials have strength higher than steel, but exhibit linear stress-strain response up to failure. Furthermore, the modulus of elasticity of GFRP is significantly lower than that of steel. This reduced stiffness often controls the design of the GFRP reinforced concrete elements. In the present investigation, GFRP reinforced beams designed based on limit state principles have been examined to understand their strength and serviceability performance. A block type rotation failure was observed for GFRP reinforced beams, while flexural failure was observed in geometrically similar control beams reinforced with steel rebars. An analytical model has been proposed for strength assessment accounting for the failure pattern observed for GFRP reinforced beams. The serviceability criteria for design of GFRP reinforced beams appear to be governed by maximum crack width. An empirical model has been proposed for predicting the maximum width of the cracks. Deflection of these GFRP rebar reinforced beams has been predicted using an earlier model available in the literature. The results predicted by the analytical model compare well with the experimental data. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007

Green house gas emissions due to concrete manufacture,carbon dioxide emissions; concrete; fly ash; granulated blast-furnace slag; life cycle assessment (LCA); Portland cement,,"Background, Aim and Scope. The issues of environmental impacts of concrete have become important since many major infrastructure owners are now requiring environmentally sustainable design (ESD). The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are often used as a rating tool to compare the environmental impact of different construction materials in ESD. Currently, the designers are forced to make estimates of CO2 emissions for concrete in ESD based on conjecture rather than data. The aim of this study was to provide hard data collected from a number of quarries and concrete manufacturing plants so that accurate estimates can be made for concretes in ESD. Materials and Methods. This paper presents the results of a research project aimed to quantify the CO2 emissions associated with the manufacture and placement of concrete. The life cycle inventory data was collected from two coarse aggregates quarries, one fine aggregates quarry, six concrete batching plants and several other sources. The results are presented in terms of equivalent CO2 emissions. The potential of fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) to reduce the emissions due to concrete was investigated. A case study of a building is also presented. Results. Portland cement was found to be the primary source of CO, emissions generated by typical commercially produced concrete mixes, being responsible for 74% to 81% of total CO2 emissions. The next major source of CO2 emissions in concrete was found to be coarse aggregates, being responsible for 13% to 20% of total CO2 emissions. The majority contribution of CO2 emissions in coarse aggregates production was found to from electricity, typically about 80%. Blasting, excavation, hauling and transport comprise less than 25%. While the explosives had very high emission factors per unit mass, they contribute very small amounts (< 0.25 %) to coarse aggregate production, since only small quantities are used. Production of a tonne of fine aggregates was found to generate 30% to 40% of the emissions generated by the production of a tonne of coarse aggregates. Fine aggregates generate less equivalent CO2 since they are only graded, not crushed. Diesel and electricity were found to contribute almost equally to the CO2 emissions due to fine aggregates production. Emission contributions due to admixtures were found to be negligible. Concrete batching, transport and placement activities were all found to contribute very small amounts of CO2 to total concrete emissions. Discussion. The CO2 emissions generated by typical normal strength concrete mixes using Portland cement as the only binder were found to range between 0.29 and 0.32 t CO2-e/m(3). GGBFS was found to be capable of reducing concrete CO2 emissions by 22% in typical concrete mixes. Fly ash was found to be capable of reducing concrete CO2 emissions by 13% to 15% in typical concrete mixes. Conclusions. The results presented are based on typical concrete manufacturing and placement methods in Australia. The data presented in this paper can be utilized to compare green house gas emissions due to concrete with those associated with alternative construction materials. Recommendations and Perspectives. The various rating schemes used to compare alternative construction materials should use models such as the one presented in this paper, based on hard data so that reliable comparisons can be made. A case study is presented in this paper demonstrating how the results may be utilized.",2007
Textile reinforced concrete for strengthening of a hypar shell structure in Schweinfurt,,,For the first time the innovative strengthening method was applied at rehabilitation and retrofitting of the shell structure of FH Schweinfurt. The reinforced-concrete structure was strengthened by textile reinforced concrete and made safer for future. Since textile-reinforced concrete is still no standardized construction material single case technical approval was given by the authorities for the application of textile reinforced concrete. This first practical application of TRC for strengthening was carried out in October/November 2006. The textile reinforced concrete strengthening was applied layer by layer on the sandblasted rough concrete surface. The strengthening layer is only 15 mm thin and consists of fine grained concrete and three layers textile fabric made of 800 tex carbon rovings.,2007

Simplified inverse method for determining the tensile strain capacity of strain hardening cementitious composites,,,"As emerging advanced construction materials, strain hardening cementitious composites (SHCCs) have seen increasing field applications recently to take advantage of its unique tensile strain hardening behavior, yet existing uniaxial tensile tests are relatively complicated and sometime difficult to implement, particularly for quality control purpose in field applications. This paper presents a new simple inverse method for quality control of tensile strain capacity by conducting beam bending test. It is shown through a theoretical model that the beam deflection from a flexural test can be linearly related to tensile strain capacity. A master curve relating this easily measured structural element property to material tensile strain capacity is constructed from parametric studies of a wide range of material tensile and compressive properties. This proposed method (UM method) has been validated with uniaxial tensile test results with reasonable agreement. In addition, this proposed method is also compared with the Japan Concrete Institute (JCI) method. Comparable accuracy is found, yet the present method is characterized with much simpler experiment setup requirement and data interpretation procedure. Therefore, it is expected that this proposed method can greatly simplify the quality control of SHCCs both in execution and interpretation phases, contributing to the wider acceptance of this type of new material in field applications.",2007
Temperature prediction of concrete-filled rectangular hollow sections in fire using green's function method,,INSULATED STEEL; HEAT-CONDUCTION; SLAB,"An efficient numerical approach using the Green's function solutions of transient heat conduction for predictions of thermal response inside a concrete-filled rectangular hollow section subjected to fire is proposed in this paper. Thermal properties of construction materials are assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous. The Green's function approach adopts different series expansions for small and large time solutions, therefore the desirable convergence properties can be achieved at any range of time by using the time partitioning strategy. A useful analytical relation in terms of step Green's functions is derived in this paper to incorporate the multidimensional effect, in particular, for Neumann (prescribed flux) boundary conditions. A modified lumped capacitance method, together with an ""orthogonal flux"" concept, are employed to deal with spatially varying heat flux at the steel-concrete interface, where Duhamel's theorem is applied in piecewise manner along the interface to incorporate the fire boundary conditions. No spatial discretization is required in the numerical algorithms based on the Green's function approach.",2007
Characterising the shear behaviour of strain-hardening fibre-reinforced cement-based composites,concrete; fibre-reinforced; shear; strain-hardening; losipescu,IOSIPESCU,"Strain-hardening fibre-reinforced cement-based composites (SHCC) are a class of fibre-reinforced concrete (FRC) that, reinforced with relatively low volumes of short fibres, exhibit strain-hardening, tough tensile and flexural response. These qualities hold promise also for ductile, superior shear behaviour, which has been demonstrated in experimental projects internationally. The potential reduction or elimination of conventional steel shear reinforcement in reinforced concrete by the use of FRC, and in particular SHCC, is an example of how the tensile ductility properties of SHCC may be exploited. Other uses include generally improved ductility and durability of structures by selective use of these superior construction materials. However, the true shear behaviour of SHCC is not yet understood and analytical and design models have not yet been formulated due to a lack of an appropriate, accurate direct shear test method. This paper describes the investigation of the shear properties of SHCC. A modified losipescu shear test is developed for SHCC by finite element analysis. An experimental program of shear tests is subsequently reported, which aims to characterise the true shear mechanisms and properties of SHCC.",2007
A method for measuring transient thermal diffusivity in hydrating Portland cement mortars using an oscillating boundary temperature,thermal diffusivity; fresh concrete; physical properties; mortar; temperature,CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; CONDUCTIVITY; CONCRETE; MOISTURE; HEAT,"The transient thermal diffusivity in early-age, type I Portland cement mortars is difficult to quantify because the exothermic reactions cause significant heat generation which complicates the analysis of heat transfer. This paper outlines the theory and setup for a method of determining the transient thermal diffusivity of Portland cement mortars by forcing an oscillating temperature on one side of the material and measuring the attenuation of the temperature oscillation with distance. This experimental method also controls temperature to acquire data over a specific and narrow temperature range. The method is illustrated using computer models and laboratory experiments on wet and dry sand and Portland cement mortar. The values of thermal difflusivity of sand and mortar determined by this method correspond well to values found in literature. This general method could be applied to other materials, including cement paste, concrete, reactive solids, or biological tissue with appropriate modification to the apparatus. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Computer aided teaching in civil engineering materials science at the University of Stuttgart,e-learning; e-teaching; WiBA-Net; knowledge network; metadata; communication,,"During the past five years the Institute of Construction Materials at the University of Stuttgart (IWB) has participated in different projects concerning e-teaching. Amongst other efforts co-workers of IWB have created a set of virtual content concerning concrete technology within a German e-teaching network in civil engineering materials science called ""WiBA-Net"" (http://www.wiba-net.de). The content of this network consists of teaching material that is organized at four different levels of granularity. At the most basic level single items (""assets"") are collected. At the second level such assets are arranged into single pages filling one screen. Several pages dealing with aspects of a single topic are ordered into a teaching path at the third level and finally a set of teaching paths forms an entire course at level four. Virtual searching methods are offered on all four levels depending on the state of the user. Besides the mentioned teaching material also virtual communication facilities are offered within the network.

The use of recycled aggregate in concrete in Hong Kong,crushed clay brick; crushed tile; construction and demolition waste; recycled aggregate,COARSE AGGREGATE; BLOCKS,"In 2004, over 20 million tonnes of construction and demolition (C&D) wastes were generated in Hong Kong. Since the local landfills will be saturated in about 8 years, it is important to find a viable way to reuse these waste materials as to alleviate the demand on public fill capacity. In order to tackle the problem, the Hong Kong government has set up a temporary recycling facility in Hong Kong in 2002 for producing different sizes of recycled aggregate for use in various construction materials. This paper summarizes the details of the construction of the Hong Kong Wetland Park which consumed approximately 14,300 m(3) of concrete prepared with recycled aggregate. However, as of today, the recycled aggregate being reused is stringently restricted to recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The use of other wastes such as brick and ceramic tile aggregate is prohibited momentarily even the combination of bricks and ceramic tiles constitutes a large portion of the C&D wastes. In order to facilitate the wider use of the inert portion of the C&D wastes, a preliminary study was conducted to investigate the possibility of using crushed brick and tile aggregate derived from construction and demolition waste stream as a replacement of fine aggregate in concrete. The effects of the use of fine crushed brick and tile aggregate as a 20 wt.% replacement of natural sand on the fresh and mechanical properties are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Microbiological destruction of constructional and decoration materials of buildings,buildings; materials; fungi; destruction; human health,HUMID BUILDINGS; EXPOSURE; MOLDS,"Factors stimulating the development and spread of micromycetes in buildings used for different purposes were investigated. A variety of materials are used for reconstruction and building: timber, shied-shaped assembled houses, air-entrained concentrate, other local materials, monolithic (expanded clay concrete) houses, large-slab houses, silicate bricks, ceramic building bricks, including special front trim (clinker, restoration, etc.). Resistance of the construction materials to biological factors is not evaluated; the interest is raised only when some concrete damage is encountered. Dampness in buildings is a common reason for a variety of health symptoms in the inhabitants. From inside walls of such buildings the fungi of the Aspergillus genus, mostly A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. penicillioides less frequently of other species were isolated. They are active producers of various metabolites, able to participate in decay processes of various materials. Conditionally pathogenic fungi were found in all the buildings investigated. Their abundance and the variety of species depended on the physical condition of the buildings, their age and the nature of the specific activities which were carried out in them.",2007
Effects of energy and carbon taxes on building material competitiveness,building materials; economic competitiveness; energy tax; carbon tax; wood products; concrete; steel; bioenergy; climate change mitigation,,"The relations between building material competitiveness and economic instruments for mitigating climate change are explored in this bottom-up study. The effects of carbon and energy taxes on building material manufacturing cost and total building construction cost are modelled, analysing individual materials as well as comparing a wood-framed building to a reinforced concrete-framed building. The energy balances of producing construction materials made of wood, concrete, steel, and gypsum are described and quantified. For wood lumber, more usable energy is available as biomass residues than is consumed in the processing steps. The quantities of biofuels made available during the production of wood materials are calculated, and the cost differences between using these biofuels and using fossil fuels are shown under various tax regimes. The results indicate that higher energy and carbon taxation rates increase the economic competitiveness of wood construction materials. This is due to both the lower energy cost for material manufacture, and the increased economic value of biomass by-products used to replace fossil fuel. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation ofwaste perlite fines in the production of construction materials,mining waste; perlite; portland cement; pozzolan,POWDER; WASTE,"The use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) is a well established practice worldwide in the manufacture of Portland cement (PC)-based construction materials. While utilisation of industrial by-products has been successful, the potential of mining wastes is yet to receive adequate attention in the context of construction materials. In an expanded form perlite, which is a naturally occurring, hydrated volcanic siliceous glass, is an ideal material as a lightweight aggregate for use in a wide range of construction materials including concrete. The mining and processing of the grades of perlite required for the production of lightweight aggregate results in the creation of a fine grained waste which currently has no economic value. This paper reports preliminary data on the utilisation of waste perlite fines as a SCM in calcium silicate-based construction material and discusses the potential of this mining waste to reduce the environmental impact of the production of conventional cement-based construction materials.",2007
Life cycle assessment: A case study of a dwelling home in Scotland,life cycle assessment; global warming; sustainability; embodied energy,,"The article provides a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a 3-bed room semi detached house in Scotland.

Embodied energy of various construction materials involved has been estimated to be equal to 227.4 GJ. It is found that concrete, timber and ceramic tiles are the three major energy expensive materials involved. It as been calculated that concrete alone consumes 65% of the total embodied energy of the home while its share of environmental impacts is even more crucial. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

New construction material from concrete production and demolition wastes and lime production waste,concrete production and demolition wastes; lime production waste; physicochemical interaction; strengthening; new structure formation,,"New construction materials were developed and patented in Brazil, based on concrete production and demolition wastes mixed with lime production waste. The main objective of this research is to utilize these two types of industrial wastes on as large a scale as possible as a new raw materials for the production of concrete. The lime waste is characterized by a high content of SiO2, Al2O3, CaCO3 and other elements. After 90 days of aging in open air, the water absorption value of the sample mixtures was 12% and the uniaxial compression strength reached up to 33 MPa, with an average of 29 MPa. XRD and SEM analyses of the compositions reveal various reasons for the material's increased strength, including transformation of the initial mineral mixture (lime and Portlandite) into calcium, magnesium and amorphous ferrous and crystalline carbonates (Calcite, Dolomite and Ancerite), and chemical interactions of the concrete waste with the lime component, which led to the growth of new amorphous and crystalline calcium hydrosilicates such as Tobermorite, Afwillite and the CSH mineral group. Although this research does not include an economic feasibility study, the zero cost of these novel raw materials for concrete is self-explanatory. However, the main advantage expected from these materials is the environmental conservation they afford, represented by the use of concrete production and demolition wastes and lime production waste.

Uniaxial compressive stress-strain model for clay brick masonry,brick masonry; compressive strength; mortar; stress-strain relations,BEHAVIOR,"Material stress-strain properties are required in the nonlinear analyses of structures. Stress-strain relationships for some construction materials such as concrete and steel are available in the literature and design codes. However, such relationships are not easily available for one of the most widely used construction material, i.e. masonry. In the present comprehensive experimental study, compressive stress-strain relationships for masonry are determined by testing 84 masonry prism specimens constructed using bricks from four different manufacturers and three mortar grades. By regression analysis of experimental data, analytical expressions are proposed to estimate the modulus of elasticity of masonry. An analytical model is proposed to adequately plot the stress-strain curves for masonry using six control points on the curves. A simplified analytical model is also proposed that can be conveniently used in finite element analysis programs.",2007
Investigations on the performance of concrete made with blended finely milled waste glass,finely milled waste glass; pozzolanic material,,"Non-recyclable waste glass, which is produced from fluorescent lamps factories, constitutes a problem for solid waste disposal in various countries worldwide. Thereby, the accumulation of waste glass in the plants, not being used, represents not only a significant loss of money and energy by occupying a big area front plants but also a negative impact on the environment. This study is considered of significant interest in the development of environmentally friendly concrete containing waste glass. Using waste glass as a construction material is a good way to help the environment following grinding and its use in concrete as a partial replacement for cement by weight. Five different concrete mixes with various percentages of finely milled waste glass (FMWG) were prepared. The test results showed that the FMWG has pozzolanic characteristics and using it as a mineral admixture in concrete, had a bad effect on workability, but improved considerably the mechanical properties of concrete at later ages. The optimum percentage of FMWG that gives the maximum values of compressive, splitting tensile and bond strengths is 10%. Results also showed that expansion due to alkali-silica reaction was minimized obviously by increase in the FMWG content.",2007

An ultra-wideband indoor radio channel model,line-of-sight; reflection; UWB,PROPAGATION,"A multipath model of UWB pulse propagation in the indoor environment is addressed in this paper. The simulation utilizes the principles of geometrical optics (GO) for direct and reflected paths' tracing and time domain technique for describing the transient electromagnetic field reflected from wall, floor, ceiling, and objects. The closed-form time domain analytic solution for UWB impulse signal reflection, which takes into account the frequency range from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz, is proposed, and it is suitable for dry concrete, wood, glass, etc., which are envisioned as common building construction materials for indoor environment. A specific house with two cube-like objects, which is thought to be a more realistic environment, is investigated. The simulation results provide the three-dimension (3D) space-time distribution of received pulsed field, which give more intrinsically interpretations for the mechanics of UWB impulse signals propagation in indoor environment.",2007
Evaluation of concrete made from recycled coarse aggregates by pulsed power discharge,,,"In Japan, the most of waste concrete scraps have been reused as roadbed materials and the recycling ratio of waste concrete scraps has been kept over 95 % from 2000. However, it is expected that the demands of waste concrete scraps as roadbed materials would decrease even though the waste concrete scraps increase with the pulling down buildings in next decade. These facts mean that the recycling of waste concrete scraps would be in the negative situation. Therefore, the development of new recycling technology of waste concrete scraps is paramount importance in Japan. In this work, the pulsed power discharges inside of waste concrete scraps immersed in water were used to reproduce the coarse aggregate. In the experiments, the Marx generator, which storages the energy of 6.4 kJ/Pulse, was used as pulsed power source and the point to hemisphere mesh electrode was immersed in water. The pulsed voltages with 400 kV of peak voltage were applied to the concrete scraps placed on hemisphere mesh and the reproduced coarse aggregates were evaluated after the repetitive discharge treatment. From the experimental results, it is found that the coarse aggregates reproduced by 40 similar to 60 pulsed discharge treatments have the enough qualities of the bone-dry density and the water absorption rate to satisfy JIS (Japan Industrial Standard) regulation (A 5005). In addition, the concretes consisted of the reproduced coarse aggregate also have the enough compressed strength and Young's module to utilize as the construction material.",2007
Utilization of concrete as a construction material in the concept of Radioactive Waste Storage in Slovak Republic,high performance concrete; fibre concrete; strength; durability; service lifetime,,"The nuclear power energy for the production of electricity seems to be, along with the alterantive ways like the wind, solar and geothermal energy, the only possibility how to cover the increasing needs for the energy in the human population. The adoption of nuclear power energy concept for the production of electricity is always a hot topic of discussion not only on the professional, but also on the political level. The join of problem of the electricity production in nuclear power plants is the disposal and storing of radioactive waste. The increasing amount of low and medium radioactive waste needs a serious concept of a long term policy in the radioactive waste management. In general, a period of 300 years is a minimum time span in which the storing facilities have to guarantie the safety of human population and environment against radiation and radiation-chemical danger.

Advances in the in-situ assessment of construction materials,,INSITU,"The deterioration of concrete in structures is a major problem throughout the world. This has prompted research on methods of predicting the service life of both existing and new structures. Current prediction methods are still very basic and, before they can be used with confidence more reliable information on the properties of the concrete in these structures is needed. In this paper a range of test methods for determining the strength and transport properties of concrete are discussed from the perspective of research at Queen's University Belfast on advances made over the past thirty years. The initial focus was on in-situ strength testing and this led to the pull-off test and the development of the LIMPET. However when it became apparent that durability was a matter of much greater concern to practising engineers, measurement of permeation properties became a priority. This led to the development of the AUTOCLAM which was found to give extremely useful correlation in the laboratory and on site between the air and water permeability and durability. Subsequently problems associated with the ingress of chlorides into concrete have been recognised and in response the PERMIT has been developed which allows the diffusion characteristics of the ""covercrete"" to be determined. Using a combination of such approaches simple durability based criteria can be developed for concrete and the remaining life of existing structures estimated. As far as new construction is concerned the above methods can be used to develop durability related design criteria and in the future continuous monitoring techniques could prove to be useful. In the context of the latter, chemical fibre optic sensors are currently being developed to detect pH changes in concrete. However their long term reliability is yet to be proven.",2007
Micro-meso-macro modelling of composite materials,,CEMENT-BASED MATERIALS,"Multi-scale models can be helpful in the understanding of complex materials used in engineering practice. Applications related to this class of problems covers different length scales in the range from mu m to m. Using the concept of representative volume elements (RVE), the theoretical background is discussed in this contribution as well as the numerical treatment of the resulting three-dimensional RVEs. The developed methodology is applied to a specific engineering material which is concrete. This construction material has to be investigated on three different scales: the hardened cement paste (hcp), the mortar and finally the concrete. Here, a successive two-stage approach is followed in which first the multi-scale model of hcp and mortar is applied. The resulting homogenization can then be used in the next step for a multi-scale mortar-concrete model. At the micro-scale of hcp, a finite element mesh based on a three-dimensional computer-tomography with different constitutive equations for the three parts unhydrated residual clinker, pores and hydrated products is introduced. With respect to the finite element solution, homogenization techniques are used in order to calculate effective elastic material properties. The constitutive equations at the micro-scale contain inelastic parameters, which cannot be obtained through experimental testings. Therefore, one has to solve an inverse problem which yields the identification of these properties. For computational efficiency and robustness, a combination of the stochastic genetic algorithm and the deterministic LEVENBERG-MARQUARDT method is used. In order to speedup the computation time significantly, all calculations are distributed automatically within a network environment. Inelastic behavior occurs when the micro-structure hcp is filled partly with water and a freezing process takes place. A constitutive model for ice is applied to the water filled parts of the micro-structure. The expansion of the ice leads to damage in the hcp which is associated with inelastic material behavior. If such a calculation is performed for different moisture and temperatures, a correlation between moisture, temperature and the inelastic material behavior can be obtained. The effective constitutive equation of hcp will serve as a basis for a multi-scale mortar-concrete model.",2007
Steel encased polymer concrete under axial compressive loading: Analytical formulations,composite columns; polymer concrete; compressive strength analysis,HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETE; FILLED TUBE COLUMNS; LATEX; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN; STATE; MODEL,"Composite structures and in particular steel encased concrete structures, are rapidly emerging as one of the inevitable structural systems for earthquake resistance, as they have been known to exploit the best attributes of steel and concrete, resulting in higher stiffness, strength and ductility. However, limitations imposed by the encased cement concrete, e.g., its brittleness, low tensile strength and diminished durability, further compounded by mounting environmental concerns since the 1997 Kyoto protocol and the need for sustainable development, dictate that novel ecologically benign construction materials be sought for the 21st century. In this context, experimental and analytical studies have been conducted on polymer-based materials (latex cement mortar and epoxy concrete) as supplementary and/ or complementary materials to ordinary cement concrete in composite tubular systems. Results from experimental work on the compressive behaviour of steel encased polymeric materials reveal significant increase in strength and/or ductility of polymer and polymer concrete filled steel stub columns. In addition, polymer formulations were found to present an array of basic properties, which could be tailored to meet specific design requirements. In conjunction with the experimental results, existing models by several researchers are evaluated and found to generally underestimate the confined strength of the fill materials. A proposed model, taking into consideration key material properties such as shear and bulk moduli, is found to depict the confined strengths satisfactorily. Finally, force-strain models are developed for the composite stub columns that adequately capture the elastic stiffness and ultimate state, unlike existing models. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to repair these aged reinforced concrete (RC) structures, a section replacement method of removal and replacement of old concrete and/or steel reinforcements of damaged sections with new concrete and/or steel reinforcements are commonly used. However, this repairing method is used without understanding the complicated structural behavior such as shear behavior of RC structures. Also, the materials commonly used for repairing are concrete and cement mortar. In order to implement the material superiority of newly developed cement based material and to complement the disadvantages of cement-based construction materials such as brittleness of failure, Ductile Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composite (DFRCC), a high performance cementitious composite with superior strain capacity, is currently being used as a repair material. However, the composite behavior between old substrate and new repair material is not clearly understood at present. In order to effectively apply DFRCC as repairing material on RC structure, the interface, the weakest part in the repaired system where most failures occur, must be studied in depth. In this research, the composite behavior of a RC flexural member repaired using the superior tensile capacity of DFRCC on the tensile face of a RC specimen is studied. Two types of DFRCC repaired RC specimens are tested, one is without shear stirrups and the other is with shear stirrups. By comparing these two types of DFRCC repaired specimens, the failure mechanism and interface debonding behavior as well as repairing capacity can be effectively studied. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Finite-element simulations of the punching tests on shear-retrofitted slab-column connections,,CONCRETE,"A new type of shear reinforcement, shear bolts, are used for retrofit and strengthening of existing previously built concrete slabs to increase the punching capacity. The bolts are installed in holes drilled in a slab in concentric perimeters around the column. The test results showed a load increase up to flexural failure of the slabs and a significantly improved ductility when using shear bolts. The punching tests were investigated using the 3D nonlinear finite-element code MASA which was developed at the Institute of Construction Materials of the Universitaet Stuttgart. The paper discusses the modeling of slabs with shear reinforcement. A proper idealization of the shear reinforcement is essential for the accuracy of the finite-element simulations. The finite-element simulations show good agreement with the test results and give a more detailed insight in the failure mechanism. The models build the basis for an extensive parametric study on the punching behavior of flat slabs.",2007

Different from known technologies an additional/alternative method and technology was developed, which uses a DC-Plasma torch with nontransferred arc. As a first step of a project a special designed DC-plasma torch with a power of approx. 40 kW was used. To reduce the costs, the torch was runned with nitrogen only or mixtures of mainly nitrogen with a small amount of argon. The generated thermal plasma with its high kinetic energy was able to melt and cut any construction material, independent from the presence and degree of steel reinforcements up to large depths and with a high velocity. In various tests the destruction of steel-reinforced concrete plates up to a thickness of 200 mm was successfully demonstrated by continuous cutting or defined hole drilling. In the latter case the samples were finally deconstructed to small blocks by thermally induced cracks between the holes. Another tested application is the decorative treatment of surfaces of natural stones (i.e. Granite) or the selective separation of such materials by thermally induced cracks.",2007
Time domain calculation of UWB impulse signal transmitting through a finitely conducting slab,impulse radio; time domain; transmission,,"A simplified closed-form analytic solution for UWB impulse signal transmitting through a finitely conducting slab is proposed in this paper. First of all, a new time domain reflection coefficient is proposed which is proved suitable for common building construction materials of indoor environment, i. e. dry concrete, wood, glass, etc. Secondly, by exploring the relationship between the reflection and refraction on slab surfaces in time domain, an analytic solution is obtained by treating refraction coefficients of both surfaces in one single expression. After developing a simplified time domain expression for propagation loss term., the resulting transient response for the transmitted pulsed field is then easily obtained by time domain convolution. A numerical example of incident monocycle transmitting though a slab using this technique is presented to illustrate the effective use of the method.",2007
"Innovative fracture-resistant construction material from C&D waste aggregate, fly ash and recycled plastics",recycled aggregate; HDPE strips; fatigue; pavement; stabilisation,PERFORMANCE; CONCRETE,"A laboratory investigation was conducted to evaluate the fracture behaviour of an alternative pavement foundation material containing cement stabilised reclaimed crushed aggregate, Class C fly ash and waste-plastic strip (high density polyethylene or HDPE) reinforcement. The primary objective of using strip reinforcement was to improve the tensile strength, crack resistance and toughness characteristics of this alternative pavement foundation material, which is composed of more than 90% by weight of waste products. Laboratory characterisation included unconfined compression, flexural and specially instrumented splitting tension tests for mix-optimisation studies based on strength and toughness and cyclic flexural tests to evaluate the resistance of the selected mix against fatigue fracture. It was found that the innovative waste composite containing recycled HDPE strips could be used as a fracture-resistant material in civil engineering construction. Concurrently, this may help address the overwhelming solid waste disposal and management issues in the US and Caribbean regions.",2007
Justifying materials selection for reinforced concrete structures. I: Sensitivity analysis,construction materials; corrosion; sensitivity analysis; life cycle cost; service life,HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE; SERVICE LIFE; CHLORIDE,"A substantial amount of research has been performed on the use of high performance construction materials and their effects on the anticipated frequency of maintenance and on the time to repair or replacement. Practical implementation of this work has been limited due to the lack of useable methods and information on the life-cycle costs and benefits of alternative approaches in the preliminary design stages of projects, when decisions regarding materials selection are typically made. The lack of simple methods for making quick life-cycle economic comparisons typically results in the use of conventional materials because their impact on performance is well known, even though high-performance materials may actually be more cost effective. This paper identifies the most significant parameters for evaluating the time to corrosion of reinforced concrete structures.",2007
Towards an empirical vulnerability function for use in debris flow risk assessment,,LANDSLIDE RISK; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HAZARDS; HUNGER,"In quantitative risk assessment, risk is expressed as a function of the hazard, the elements at risk and the vulnerability. From a natural sciences perspective, vulnerability is defined as the expected degree of loss for an element at risk as a consequence of a certain event. The resulting value is dependent on the impacting process intensity and the susceptibility of the elements at risk, and ranges from 0 (no damage) to 1 (complete destruction). With respect to debris flows, the concept of vulnerability - though widely acknowledged - did not result in any sound quantitative relationship between process intensities and vulnerability values so far, even if considerable loss occurred during recent years. To close this gap and establish this relationship, data from a well-documented debris flow event in the Austrian Alps was used to derive a quantitative vulnerability function applicable to buildings located on the fan of the torrent. The results suggest a second order polynomial function to fit best to the observed damage pattern. Vulnerability is highly dependent on the construction material used for exposed elements at risk. The buildings studied within the test site were constructed by using brick masonry and concrete, a typical design in post-1950s building craft in alpine countries. Consequently, the presented intensity-vulnerability relationship is applicable to this construction type within European mountains. However, a wider application of the presented method to additional test sites would allow for further improvement of the results and would support an enhanced standardisation of the vulnerability function.",2007
Life cycle assessment of construction processes,,,"Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology by which the environmental impacts of a product or a process can be evaluated throughout its life cycle. The methodology can serve as a decision tool in the selection of construction materials and optimization of construction processes. The paper presents the theoretical background of a particular method, and to demonstrate its flexibility and capabilities, a case study of a reinforced concrete wall cast in situ is analysed. Based on the inventory of all materials and processes required for this wall, the LCA analysis is carried out. Various scenarios for the selection of the different constituent materials of the were considered, and the results show that the selection of different concrete constituent materials has a major influence upon the environmental parameters, in particular, energy use and global warming. The analysis clearly shows the selection of the cement type (in terms of supplementary cementing materials content) is the single most important component of a reinforced concrete structure in terms of its environmental impact.",2007
A study on the physical properties of hard concrete mixing various type of recycled aggregate,,,"Concrete waste causes serious problems in social and economic parts. Namely, construction industry will confront serious problems due to shortage of natural aggregate unless we don't improve and consider this problem. So, it is needed urgently to recycle these huge concrete wastes, and to develop substitution material as another type of recycling construction material in point of sustainable development. Current recycled aggregates are used in part of non-structure in building due to low strength, so, it is too effective to recycle it as structural material by increasing its low strength, because it could solve the shortage problem of aggregates for concrete and also increase the stability on demand and supply in economics. Thus, this study aims to select recycled aggregate for construction material to analyze the physical properties of recycled aggregate and concrete mixed it. Also, this Study is going to analyze physical properties on concrete when mixing recycled aggregate into it on the point of view in sustainable part. This study contains experimental analysis and results of hard concrete mixing various types of recycled aggregate.",2007
Sustainable concrete production,,PLANTS,"Concrete is the most widely produced construction material, and large quantities of waste materials from construction as well as from other industries can be re-used in its production. The paper presents results of experimental investigations of the behavior of concrete containing crushed waste concrete (rubble) as aggregate and the behavior of concrete containing waste wash water from ready mix concrete production. The influence of different additions to concrete upon various mechanical properties as well as durability of such concrete are presented. The results show that both recycled materials investigated have a potential to be used in concrete production.",2007
General issues of construction materials recycling in USA,,,"Nearly all building materials have the potential for reuse following their initial useful life. Although reuse possibilities are available for building materials following demolition, deconstruction maximizes this potential because it allows these materials to be recovered with the least possible amount of damage. Additionally, the organizational nature of deconstruction involves sorting separate materials, which further facilitates reuse opportunities. Wood, steel, concrete, asphalt roofing, brick, plastics, and drywall all have high reuse potential. This paper evaluates the existing practice of reuse of construction materials in the USA and recommends suggestions for increasing construction materials reuse.",2007
Creep and drying shrinkage of recycled aggregate concrete,recycled aggregate concrete; creep; shrinkage,,"Recycled aggregate concrete is a potential construction material of twenty first century in view of its compatibility with sustainable development. Considerable research work has been reported in the literature over past two decade. More research work is in progress to ascertain the performance of recycled aggregate concrete to make it on par construction material with conventional concrete for its wide application in construction industry. The research work on creep and shrinkage properties of recycled aggregate concrete reported in this paper is one such attempt. Three grades of concrete viz., M20, M25, and M30 were considered for the investigation. To study the influence of recycled aggregate, three types of recycled aggregates processed from concrete rubble obtained from three sources having different concrete history. In all, nine recycled aggregate concrete mixtures and three conventional concrete mixtures were considered to understand the relative performance of concretes in terms of creep and shrinkage properties. The test results reveal higher creep and shrinkage strains in the range of 14% to 33%, and 3% to 30% respectively. The creep and shrinkage characteristics of recycled aggregate concrete evaluated during the present research programme have shown significant improvement over the investigation results reported earlier. Thus, these encouraging results provide scope for further research and develop recycled aggregate concrete of on par quality with conventional concrete for use in construction industry.",2007
Study on properties of concrete containing granulated blast furnace slag,blended cement; GBFS; drying; slag; saturation degree,GGBS,"Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GBFS) is obtained by quenching molten iron blast furnace slag (a by-product of iron and steel making) in water or stream, to produce a glassy granular product that is then dried and ground into a fine powder. Blended cement concrete is known to have lower pore connection and smaller pore size which it means to have lower risk of chloride penetration. GBFS is a green construction material used to make durable concrete structures in combination with Portland cement (PC). Manufacturing of Portland cement is a major contributor of greenhouse gases, responsible for about 5% of all global carbon dioxide emissions. By comparison, production of GBFS requires less than a fifth the energy and produces less than a tenth of the carbon dioxide emissions. Replacing PC with GBFS can significantly decrease the risk of sulfate attack, alkali silica reaction and chloride penetration. In this work, over 200 samples with various w/c ratios and various percentage of GBFS has been cast. Various tests to measure the pore structure of concrete have been studied. Replacing PC partially with GBFS shows very good results on various aspects of concrete characteristics.",2007
Flexural behaviour of slurry infiltrated fibrous concrete (SIFCON) restrained two-way slabs,SIFCON slabs; flexural test; cyclic load; high volume fibres; FRC and plain slabs,,"Slurry infiltrated fibre concrete (SIFCON) is one of the recently developed construction material. SIFCON could be considered as a special type of fibre concrete with high fibre content. The matrix consists of cement slurry or flowing cement mortar. This composite material has already been used for structures subjected to blast loading, repair of pre-stressed concrete beams and safe vaults. Because of its excellent energy absorption characteristics, pre-cast SIFCON slabs can have a wide range of structural and nuclear engineering applications. At present very little is known about its behavior. This paper presents the information on behavior of two-way restrained slabs in flexure. The experimental investigation is proposed on two-way SIFCON slabs with all the four edges restrained and subjected to uniformly distributed loading. The experimental program comprises of casting and testing of nine SIFCON slabs, three fibre reinforced concrete slabs (2% fibre) and three plain concrete slabs (M20) fixed on all four edges. SIFCON slabs with three different percentages of fibre viz. 8, 10 and 12% have been cast and tested. All the slabs are square and are of size 600X600X50 mm. The investigation envisages studying the strength and stiffness behavior of SIFCON slabs up to first crack and ultimate loads under flexure. The results of SIFCON slabs are compared with slabs made of Plain Concrete (M20 grade) and Fibre reinforced concrete. The results of the experimental investigation indicate that slabs with 12% fibre posses excellent performance when compared to plain concrete slabs and fibre reinforced concrete slabs in all respects.",2007
Breaching of triple-brick walls: Numerical simulations,,,"Explosive wall breaching will be a key war-fighter capability in future military operations by dismounted soldiers in urban terrain environments where the close proximity of urban structures, possibly occupied by noncombatants, significantly restricts the use of large demolition charges or large caliber direct-fire weapons. Because of this requirement, the US Army has focused considerable attention and resources to optimize breaching activities in urban terrain. As part of the Army's effort, the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is conducting experimental and numerical investigations to improve wall breaching methods. The ongoing experimental and numerical programs will conduct comprehensive breaching research on a full range of urban construction materials. As a first step in this process, the ERDC conducted a successful baseline study of Composition C4 (C-4) breaching effectiveness against steel-reinforced-concrete walls. Recently, the research effort was extended to triple-brick walls. Numerical simulations of two selected experiments were conducted using the coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian code Zapotec. In these simulations, the brick and mortar were modeled as Lagrangian materials, and the C-4 was modeled as an Eulerian material.",2007
Sustainability of the cement and concrete industries,,,"Sustainability is important to the well-being of our planet, continued growth of a society, and human development. Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials in the world. However, the production of portland cement an essential constituent of concrete, leads to the release of significant amount of CO2, a greenhouse gas (GHG); production of one ton of portland cement produces about one ton Of CO2 and other GHGs. The environmental issues associated with GHGs, in addition to natural resources issues, will play a leading role in the sustainable development of the cement and concrete industry during this century. For example, as the supply of good-quality limestone to produce cement decreases it will become more difficult to produce adequate amounts of portland cement for construction. There is a possibility that once there is no more limestone, say in a geographical region, and thus no portland cement, all of the employment associated with the concrete industry as well as new construction projects will be terminated. Due to limited natural resources, concern over GHGs, or, both, there are regions in the world where cement production is being curtailed, or, at least, cannot be increased to keep up with the population increase. Therefore, it is necessary to look for sustainable solutions for future concrete construction. A sustainable concrete structure is constructed in order to ensure that the total environmental impact during its life cycle, including its use, will be minimal. Sustainable concrete should have a very low inherent energy requirement, be produced with little waste, be made from some of the most plentiful resources on earth, produce durable structures, have a very high thermal mass, and be made with recycled materials. Sustainable constructions have a small impact on the environment. They use ""green"" materials, which have low energy costs, high durability, low maintenance requirements, and contain a large proportion of recycled or recyclable materials. Green materials also use less energy and resources, and can lead to high-performance cements and concrete. Concrete must keep evolving to satisfy the increasing demands of all of its users. Designing for sustainability means accounting for the short-term and long-term environmental consequences in the design.",2007
Potential uses for coal combustion by-products for sustainable construction materials,,CONCRETE,"More than 123 million tons of solid by-products are produced by coal-burning electric utilities each year in the United States [ACAA 2005]. In particular, the annual production of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) by-products continues to increase. As landfill space becomes more limited and expensive, there is incentive to find productive and sustainable uses for coal combustion by-products (CCBs). However, by-products utilization technology is not likely to be adopted by the construction industry unless it is more cost-effective than land filling and the resulting construction has sufficient thawing. Therefore, it is extremely important that the electric-utility industry provide guidance to CCB research and development programs. Likewise, government agencies and private-sector organizations that may be able to utilize these materials should also provide input. A U.S. Department of Energy - National Energy Technology Laboratory-funded program, the Combustion Byproducts Recycling Consortium (CBRC), serves as an effective vehicle for acquiring and maintaining guidance from these diverse organizations so that the proper balance in research and development is achieved. The mission of the CBRC is to promote and support the commercially viable and environmentally sound recycling of CCBs for productive uses, through scientific research, development, and field testing. Since its inception in 1998, the CBRC has funded 52 CCB research projects nationwide with a total value exceeding $10 million. Projects have ranged from using CCBs in mine void filling, surface mine reclamation, soil remediation, road base materials and aggregates to marine structures, lagoon liners, transmission poles, and building products. This paper focuses specifically on the projects related to using CCBs for construction materials including wall panels, siding, bricks, masonry units, countertops, and wall and floor tiles. Project results and findings are presented.",2007
A life cycle perspective on recycling construction materials (The most sustainable materials may be the ones we already have),,,"Noted sustainability authority Paul Hawken points out that nearly all production and distribution business models entirely ignore associated environmental burdens when calculating acquisition prices for goods and services; further, purchase prices rarely reflect true costs of the aftermath when remnants are disposed of, most often by landfilling. Does the current price of construction account for the damage inflicted on the environment through materials production, construction activities, and ultimately the disposal of facilities when their service life is exhausted? What are these ignored impacts and how does one begin to define and account for them? This paper acquaints the audience with the life-cycle consequences of generating and landfilling construction and demolition debris, and the benefits of salvaging, reusing, and recycling construction materials. The United States Army continuously upgrades it's infrastructure to meet current mission requirements. Wood framed barracks complexes constructed in World War 11 are being removed. Concrete and masonry complexes built during the Cold War are being replaced by contemporary facilities. In so doing, enormous quantities of debris materials are generated. These include wood, concrete, metals, asphalt materials, fibrous materials, masonry and other construction materials. Efforts to divert construction and demolition debris from landfills, and to recycle these materials for construction applications are described. By examining available Life Cycle Assessment data, a first approximation of the value of these recovered materials is presented; however, their value is expressed in terms of the reduction in burdens to the natural environment by virtue of the process. This information provides a piece of the sustainability puzzle, which is the determination of the ""true costs"" of goods and services which must incorporate the value of that part of the environment which was used to create the product.",2007
Lightweight Structural Systems Made of Textile Reinforced Concrete,alkali-resistant glass fibers; application; carbon fibers; precast concrete; textile reinforced concrete; light-weight structure,,"Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC) is a composite material taking advantage of the non-corrosiveness of fiber materials such as alkali-resistant glass (AR-glass), carbon or aramid in order to design slender and filigree structural elements. Compared to short cut fibers, a textile reinforcement features a higher effectiveness, because the fiber bundles are arranged in the direction of the main tensile stresses. These properties make TRC a promising construction material suitable for a wide range of structural or cladding applications. The material can be produced in plate or panel form, or as a lattice structure, each of these forms requiring different production and connection techniques. Investigations aim to identify appropriate applications for TRC. These include principles for facade, housing and load-bearing systems using slender TRC-elements. Geometric and structural modifications are necessary for improving the performance of thin-walled building components in textile-reinforced concrete. Using selected applications we outline the main principles of component design in relation to type of load, method of production and connection details.",2007
Solidification and recycling of incinerator bottom ash through the addition of colloidal silica (SiO2) solution,,SOLID-WASTE INCINERATOR; FLY-ASH; CONCRETE; HYDRATION; PRODUCTS; STRENGTH; SLAG,"The possibility of using incinerator bottom ash as a substitute for natural aggregates was investigated. Rough, porous surface of bottom ash, which diminishes the strength of solidified products, was improved by colloidal silica solution. As a result, a significant increase of mechanical strength was accomplished by a slight amount of silica (< 1 wt% to total). Moreover, pozzolanic reaction was induced in initial cement hydration due to the nano-particle size of about 20 nm in colloidal silica solution. Cylindrical specimens and bricks were prepared from bottom ash added to a colloidal silica (SiO2) solution and cement, and then their compressive strengths were evaluated. Cylindrical specimens showed an increase of approximately 60% in compressive strength when colloidal solution containing 4 wt% silica particles was sprayed onto the bottom ash. The strength of bricks containing colloidal silica was in excess of 20 MPa, which meets the requirement of construction materials. Results of leaching tests based on Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP) proved that the solidified bottom ash possessed good chemical stability. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Assessment of external dose indoors in Lithuania,,BUILDING-MATERIALS; RADIATION; RADIOACTIVITY; POPULATION; CITY,"The aim of this paper was an assessment of external exposure indoors and its dependence on construction materials and indoor radon concentrations in Lithuanian living houses. Relationship of absorbed dose rate in air indoors and activity indexes of the most commonly used construction materials (wood, concrete and bricks) have been studied using results received in measurements done in > 4700 rooms in 1995-2005. Possible connections of dose rate indoors with indoor radon concentrations are also discussed. Findings of this study helped to make an assessment of the mean value of effective dose of Lithuanian population due to external exposure indoors which is equal to 0.58 mSv y(-1). The received data might also be used in improvement of quality of personal dosimetric measurements done in premises constructed of different construction materials.",2006

Development of construction materials using sulfite-rich scrubber sludge and fly ash,sulfite-rich scrubber sludge; fly ash; construction materials,,"Construction materials with characteristics suitable for a variety of applications have been developed using up to 95% of coal combustion by-products comprising of sulfite-rich scrubber sludge and fly ash. These materials can be produced as soil-like mixes that can be prepared at the power plant, transported to the deployment site and compacted using conventional road building equipment without a need for forms. These developed materials provide an early strength of 5.8-8.3 MPa after 7-14 d and are environmentally benign. For a cattle feeding pad application, which is the focus of this paper, the cost is estimated be about 25-30% of the cost of developing a conventional concrete feeding pad. Following mix development and establishment of-quality assurance/quality control protocols, a commercial cattle feeding pad has been designed and demonstrated using the developed mix.

Comparative studies of three methods for activating rejected fly ash,,MECHANICAL TREATMENT; CEMENT MORTARS; CASO4-CENTER-DOT-2H(2)O; REACTIVITY; CA(OH)(2); HYDRATION; CONCRETE; PASTES; GFA,"Pulverised fuel ash is a by-product of burning coal during the generation of electricity. In many places, the collected pulverised fuel ash has to be processed through a classifying stage before it can be used as a construction material. The rejected portion of the classifying process has remained unused due to its high carbon content and large particle size (> 45 mu m). However, the rejected ash may be used in certain areas, such as in solidification and stabilisation processes of hazardous waste, and materials for road base or sub-base construction, which require relatively lower strength and reactivity. This paper presents the results of a study on the pozzolanic properties of cementitious materials prepared by blending rejected fly ash (rFA) with calcium hydroxide. The effects of adding chemical activators, elevating curing temperature, and grinding of the ash particles on the activation of rFA were compared by means of compressive strength, differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction analysis and mercury intrusion porosimetry tests. The results show that the addition of Na2SO4 can significantly accelerate the strength development both at 28 and 90 days. K2SO4 is only effective at 28 days. The addition of flue gas desulphurisation sludge (a low-grade gypsum) and grinding can only increase the strength at 90 days. Pretreatment by steam curing decreases the 90 day strength of the samples. The compressive strength results correlate nicely with the results of the porosity and the thermal analysis tests. Adding chemical activators seems to be an effective and economical method to accelerate the hydration of rFA.",2006
Numerical analysis of attenuation effect of EPS geofoam on stress-waves in civil defense engineering,stress-waves; EPS geofoam; geometric dimension; decay factor; empirical formula,,"Civil defense shelters are often constructed below ground to provide protection against blast loading. Concrete has been used extensively as a construction material for the defense layer of the shelters. In order to achieve expected attenuation of blast-induced stress-waves, geofoam or cavity inclusions are sometimes embedded in the concrete layer. This paper studies the attenuation of stress-waves in a concrete medium behind a rectangular inclusion of expanded polystyrene (EPS) geofoam with different dimensions. The effects of EPS geofoam inclusions on the reduction of peak axial stress a, and hydrostatic pressure P are studied, respectively. One approximation formula is proposed to correlate the decay factor for peak a, to the dimensions of the EPS geofoam inclusion based on numerical simulations. This formula is applicable in defense engineering design to estimate the decay factors at different locations or the dimensions of EPS geofoam when other parameters are prescribed. Finally, the effects of multiple rectangular inclusions of EPS geofoam on stress-waves are numerically investigated. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2006
Inspection of internal structure of walls by subsurface radar,,,"This paper deals with the application of ultra-wide band time-domain subsurface radars, equipped with special signal processing techniques, to realize non-invasive image testing of the building walls' internal structure that are made with brick, stone, concrete, reinforced concrete, and other construction materials. There are two normally associated problems: qualitative and quantitative, considered. Limitations and shortcomings of radar imaging, due to inherent physical features as well as signal processing improving the quality of radar images, are discussed. Actual field data are used to illustrate applications of subsurface radar for non-destructive testing of walls' internal regions.",2006
Load-bearing behaviour and simulation of textile reinforced concrete,,,"The new composite material Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC) is a promising development which may open up entirely new fields for the application of the construction material concrete. The possible more filigree structures with high quality surfaces make TRC an attractive choice for the architect and give the engineer more freedom in design.

National survey on the natural radioactivity and Rn-222 exhalation rate of building materials in the Netherlands,"Rn-222, indoor; radioactivity, natural; spectrometry, gamma; exhalation",RADON EXHALATION; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; GAMMA-RADIATION; CONCRETE; DWELLINGS; DIFFUSION,"The present study reports on results of a nationwide survey on the natural radioactivity concentrations and Rn-222 exhalation rates of the prevailing building materials in the Netherlands. In total 100 samples were taken and analyzed for the activity concentrations of Ra-226, Ra-228, Th-228, and K-40 and for their Rn-222 exhalation rate. The sampled materials consisted of gypsum products, aerated concrete, sand-lime and clay bricks, mortars and concrete, representing about 95% of the stony building materials used in the construction of Dutch homes. The laboratory analyses were performed according to two well-documented standard procedures, the interlaboratory reproducibility of which is found to be within 5% on average. The highest radionuclide concentrations were found in a porous inner wall brick to which fly ash was added. The second highest were clay bricks with average Ra-226 and Ra-228 levels around 40 Bq kg(-1). Concrete and mortar show the highest exhalation rates with a fairly broad range of 1 to 13 mu Bq (kg s)(-1). Low natural radioactivity levels are associated with either natural gypsum (products) or gypsum from flue gas desulphurization units, and low exhalation rates with clay bricks. To evaluate the radiological impact the radioactivity concentrations in each sample were combined into a so-called dose factor, representing the absorbed dose rate in a room with a floor, walls and ceiling of 20 cm of the material in question. For that purpose, calculations with the computer codes MCNP, Marmer and MicroShield on the specific absorbed dose rates were incorporated in the paper. The results of these codes corresponded within 6% and average values were calculated at 0.90, 1.10, and 0.080 nGy h(-1) per Bq kg(-1) for the U-238 series, the Th-232 series, and K-40, respectively. Model calculations on the external dose rate, based on the incidence of the various building materials in 1,336 living rooms, are in accordance with measured data.",2006
THE ROLE OF HVFA CONCRETE IN THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE URBAN BUILT ENVIRONMENT,LEED; high Volume fly ash concrete; green engineering,,"Although fly-ash as a partial replacement for cement has been utilized for many years, its use has been almost exclusively used in low volume percentages such as 10% or 20% cement replacement. This paper looks at high volume percentage replacements from 40% to 70%. A mini-mix study revealed that 50% and 60% cement replacement percentages were the best candidates for full scale testing. The environmental benefits included a 25% reduction in smog, human health, and fossil fuel reduction compared to the same element built with 100% Portland cement mix. The economic benefits included a 15% capital cost reduction and a 20% life-cycle cost reduction when compared with a 100% Portland cement mix. Full scale testing included a complete mix design in addition to the construction of four concrete infrastructure products. The products built included an alley panel and curb and gutter sections in the City and county of Denver, a precast manhole and lid, and a twin tee prestressed girder. Although cement products are just one of many materials used in the construction of the built environment, its production has a large impact on the environment. Lowering the embodied energy of multiple types of construction materials will have a significant effect on sustainable urban development. Symbiotic recycling of waste material, such as fly ash in concrete, back into the built environment can help reduce materials on the input side and pollution on the output side of the hulk material flow of an urban city.(4)",2006
Surely we know all about cement - don't we?,Joseph Mellor; cement chemistry; concrete; delayed ettringite formation; thaumasite sulphate attack,DELAYED ETTRINGITE FORMATION; THAUMASITE SULFATE ATTACK; PORTLAND-CEMENT; MORTARS; MAGNESIUM; PASTES; FORM; MICROSTRUCTURE; CONCRETE; FIELD,"Plaster, cement and concrete have been used since antiquity, notably by the Romans. Portland cement was patented by Joseph Aspdin of Leeds in 1824. Since then it has been gradually refined to become the fundamental constituent of modern concrete, familiar to all of us as the major construction material of the past century. Contemporary constructions such as skyscrapers, concert halls, suspension bridges and huge dams testify to the successful use of Portland cement concrete. For routine constructions its compressive strength development and durability are sufficiently well understood for it to be used with confidence in many diverse situations and in locations with widely different climate conditions. Even in the last 30 years, however, unexpected durability problems, such as the alkali silica reaction (ASR), delayed ettringite formation (DEF) and the thaumasite form of sulphate attack (TSA), have emerged. To ensure that the civil engineer can take the necessary steps to avoid their occurrence has required the methods of materials science to be applied to understand the mechanism of these processes. Recent ideas pertaining to the reaction mechanisms underlying DEF and TSA are critically reviewed.",2006
An analysis of the propagation of front shock in concrete,,,"The aim of the authors is to model the shock response of concrete structures submitted to the effects of projectile penetration or contact detonation, in a range of pressure levels from 0 to 20 GPa. The limitations of current computers imply the need to homogenize the response of the different constituents of concrete into a single macroscopic model. Though concrete is widely used as a construction material, the knowledge concerning its response under shock loading response remains rather modest. An exhaustive review of the research effort in this field shows that the limited available data is affected by an important dispersion. As a consequence, any general rule correlating the composition of concrete to its shock properties have not yet been evidenced. A simple method to predict the shock Hugoniot of concrete based on a mixture theory is developed considering concrete as a mix of cement hydrates, free water, rock and voids. Experimental results obtained on special concrete compositions are presented. They illustrate the relation between the wave structure and the size of the aggregates, and so, the level of heterogeneity of the composition. Numerical simulations demonstrate the ability of a mesoscopic model to describe this phenomenon, and the failure of the homogenized approach to do so.",2006
Analysis of corrosion resistance behavior of inhibitors in concrete using electrochemical techniques,inhibitors; concrete; chloride; diffusion; corrosion resistance,STEEL; NA2PO3F,"Reinforced concrete is one of the most durable and cost effective construction materials. However, in high chloride environments, it can suffer from corrosion due to chloride induced breakdown of the normal passive layer protecting the reinforcing steel bars inside concrete. One means of protecting embedded steel reinforcement from chloride induced corrosion is the addition of corrosion inhibiting admixtures. In the present investigation, various inhibitors such as sodium nitrite, zinc oxide, mono ethanol amine, diethanolamine, and triethanol amine have been used in concrete in different percentages. Their effectiveness was then studiea using various electrochemical techniques such as rapid chloride ion penetration test, open circuit potential measurement, electrochemical impedance measurement, potentiodynamic polarization measurement, and gravimetric weight loss measurement. The results thus obtained indicate that the addition of inhibitors enhances the corrosion resistance properties.",2006
Potential of wood waste ash as an additive in concrete,,COAL COMBUSTION; FLY-ASH; METALS,"The enormous amount of wastes produced during wood processing operations in many countries provides challenging opportunities for the use of wood waste as a construction material. In this research, wood waste (sawdust and wood shaving) ash (WWA) of pretreated timber of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% by weight of cement was added as a supplement to a concrete of mix proportion 1:2:4:0.56 (cement: sand: coarse aggregate:water cement ratio), and the strengths and the water absorption of the matrix were evaluated. Also, the metal leachability of WWA was analyzed. The compressive and the flexural strengths of WWA concrete for the ages investigated ranged from 12.83 to 28.66 N/mm(2), and 3.65 to 5.57 N/mm(2), respectively, with the lowest values obtained at 30% additive level of ash. When compared with the strength of plain concrete (control), the compressive and flexural strengths of WWA concrete were between 62 and 91% and 65 and 98%, respectively, of the former. The trend of the water absorption of WWA concrete was a reversal of those of the strengths, that is, the highest water absorption values were recorded for concrete specimens with the highest additive level of ash. A batch leaching test also performed at an ash-leachant volumetric ratio of 20 produced leachate containing chromium, arsenic, iron, copper, and zinc at the following concentrations: 410, 6720, 150, 280, and 1690 mu g/L, respectively, when leached at a pH of 4, and 400, 10,670, 0, 100, 1470 mu g/L. respectively, when leached at a pH of 5. These concentration levels exceed the EPA fresh water acute criteria limits.",2006
Durability design of infrastructure and some related issues,aggressive environment; construction materials; deterioration; durability; durability audits; life cycle performance; macrostructure; microstructure; socioeconomic and environmental considerations; sustainability,CONCRETE; STEEL,"The life cycle performance of any infrastructure should be taken into consideration in its design, its construction, its maintenance, its operation, and when needed, its rehabilitation. The protection of infrastructure must be holistic, taking into account long-term socioeconomic and environmental considerations and the impact of the global climate change. Fulfilling the requirements of the ultimate and serviceability limit states over the service life of the facility requires an understanding of the use of the system, the deterioration response of the materials and their components when subjected to aggressive environments, and how this deterioration can be prevented or significantly delayed by preventive, remedial, and routine maintenance. The composition, microstructure, macrostructure, and various modes of deterioration of materials used in construction (steel, wood, concrete) are reviewed, along with possible remedial measures. The development of concrete as a construction material, its durability, and the relevant durability provisions in the various Canadian Standards Association standards are reviewed briefly. Current European practice and the 1990 Comite Euro-International du beton Design Guide for Durable Concrete Structures are evaluated. The engineer's responsibility for durable performance of a facility and the importance of durability audits are also examined.",2006

Waste management is pressing harder with the alarming signal warning the industry. Reuse, recycling and reduce the wastes consider as the only methods to recover those waste generated; however, the implementations still have much room for improvement. This paper reviews the technology on construction waste recycling and their viability. Ten material recycling practices are studied, including: (i) asphalt, (ii) brick, (iii) concrete, (iv) ferrous metal, (v) glass, (vi) masonry, (vii) non-ferrous metal, (viii) paper and cardboard, (ix) plastic and (x) timber.

"A methodology for determining complex permittivity of construction materials based on transmission-only coherent, wide-bandwidth free-space measurements",complex permittivity; transmission coefficient; radar; time difference of arrival; parametric system identification,ELECTROMAGNETIC PROPERTIES; COAXIAL PROBE; CONCRETE; FREQUENCIES,"An integrated methodology for determining the unique combination of complex permittivity based on measured transmission coefficient and time difference of arrival (TDOA) information in free-space measurements is proposed. The methodology consists of an estimation procedure of the real part of complex permittivity based on TDOA, and a root-searching procedure based on parametric system identification (SI) together with an error sum of squares (SSE) criterion. Generally, non-unique combinations of dielectric constant and loss factor are encountered when lossy or low-loss materials are measured and the proposed methodology is aimed at the determination of unique combinations of dielectric constant and loss factor for such materials. The proposed methodology is validated by measurements of several materials with known dielectric properties. The estimated complex permittivity values for Teflon, Lexan, Bakelite, and concrete are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The method has potential for in-situ measurement of dielectric properties for construction materials. Applicability and limitations of the methodology are discussed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantitative AE techniques standardized for concrete structures,acoustic emission; concrete; damage; corrosion; moment tensor analysis,ACOUSTIC-EMISSION,"Acoustic emission (AE) techniques have been extensively applied to concrete structures. Up-dated results are currently standardized to inspect and evaluate the structures in service. Consequently, test results based on these standards are reviewed and discussed. In order to assess the damage levels of the structures, the recommended practice is proposed by the Japanese Society for Non-Destructive Inspection. Two AE parameters of load ratio and calm ratio are defined for qualification of the damages. It is reported that damages qualified are in good agreement with actual damages of reinforced concrete members under bending. AE behavior of concrete under compression could be analyzed, applying the rate process analysis. By quantifying intact Young's moduli of concrete from the database, relative damages of concrete in existing structures are successfully estimated. The committee on nondestructive inspection of steel-reinforced concrete structures in the Federation of Construction Materials Industries, Japan, has recently published new standards on estimation of concrete properties by elastic-wave methods. One of them is a monitoring method for active cracks in concrete by AE, which is applied to study corrosion cracking in concrete. Moment tensor analysis of AE can identify cracking kinematics of location, crack-type and crack orientation, which is implemented as SiGMA procedure. Nucleation of micro-cracking due to corrosion is identified. It is found that the mechanisms iof corrosion cracking in concrete are nearly equally of mode I, mixed-mode and mode II.",2006
Assessment of fire-induced damage on concrete segment of shield TBM tunnel,fire; underground structure; concrete segment; damage,,"To protect underground structures and passengers from fire, it is essential to characterize fire-induced damage on the construction materials for underground structures. However, it is almost impossible and uneconomical to carry out full-scale fire tests in tunnels that are under public usage. In this study, a high temperature furnace capable of simulating RABT (Richtlinien ftir die Ausstattung und den Betrieb von Stra beta entunneln) fire curve was newly designed and manufactured. In the fire tests, furnace temperature is set to reach 1,200 degrees C within five minutes after ignition. The temperature of 1,200 degrees C was maintained for one hour, and the fire was extinguished after two hours had elapsed. From the temperature measurement by thermocouples embedded in test specimens, the depth of lost concrete was estimated to reach approximately 20 cm from the surface that was exposed to fire. In addition, the alteration of physico-mechanical properties and microstructures of concrete segments after fire tests were investigated from core specimens. The results show that the deterioration of material properties was up to 10 cm from the surface of the remaining concrete block.",2006
Behaviour of concrete beams reinforced with hybrid FRP composite rebars,,,"Recent extensive research has led to a better understanding of the application of various corrosion protection methods in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. One method is to use fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composite rebars for conventional reinforcement in concrete. However, obstacles such as low elastic moduli, low pre-rupture elongation, brittle fracture, poor alkaline resistance as well as high cost currently restrict the use of composite rebars as a common construction material. In order to overcome such deficiencies, a new core-shell model of a hybrid composite rebar was developed for RC structures. In this new model, steel fibers and glass fibers randomly dispersed through the cross section of the core, while Kevlar and carbon fibers are placed within the shell to increase the elastic modulus, as well as to serve as a shield for protecting the glass fibers and the steel fibers from alkaline attack. Samples of the new hybrid composite rebars were fabricated by the hand winding method, and a series of concrete beams, reinforced with the hybrid FRP rebars, were tested to determine the bending moment capacity and mechanical properties of the beams. The test results were compared with those of traditional RC beams. The hybrid FRP rebars were also studied in accelerated alkaline ageing tests, using concrete pore solutions at different temperatures, and their service life and alkaline resistance were determined.",2006
Ecological impact and economic aspects of advanced concrete technologies,life cycle analysis; ecology; water repellents; superplasticizer; polymer fibers,,"Reinforced concrete structures are often conceived for a certain time span of serviceability. Due to the superposition of different kinds of loads and particularly due to the presence of aggressive substances the resistance of construction materials is insufficient in numerous cases. Hence, many structures have to be repaired before the end of their designed life span. In case of reinforced concrete structures these repair measures are not only very expensive but they also consume high amounts of energy and materials which causes strong environmental impacts. The main challenge in developing reliable concrete technologies is the capability to enhance the life span of new and already repaired structures to a reasonable maximum. When aiming this objective not only durability related material properties have to be accomplished but their environmental impact has to be minimized simultaneously. This paper evaluates different concrete technologies and materials from diverse perspectives: Durability (simulating expected life span using numerical analyses), ecology (product life cycle and environmental impact assessments) and economy (estimating life cycle costs by investment appraisals). This kind of combined analysis facilitates the efficient design of structural elements and repair measures and provides the possibility to significantly increase the life span of new and repaired concrete structures.",2006

The shear resistance at all interfaces tested is frictional with the exception of cast-in-place concrete where it is adhesional. The friction coefficient between EPS geofoam blocks ranges from 0.70 to 0.84 with an average of 0.80.

Thermochemical analysis in the presintering phase of aggregates from sludge-marine clay mixes,sludge; clays; temperature; aggregates; thermal analysis; recycling,INDUSTRIAL SLUDGE; CONCRETE; REUSE; ASH,"Rapid industrialization and urbanization in a highly limited land area leads to serious waste disposal problems. Scarcity of land causes the disposal of waste in landfills to be extremely uneconomical. An attractive alternative to waste disposal is conversion of waste into new resources. Past studies have indicated that the conversion of wastes into construction materials is a potential option for management of high volume wastes. However, due to the high processing costs of the wastes, the conversion may not be economically viable. This study examines the detailed thermochemistry of sludge-clay mixes in providing an in-depth understanding of the reactions involved during the process of fusion. Thermal gravimetric analysis detected increased weight loss of the materials around the temperatures of 520 and 900 degrees C, indicating volatilization of organic matter and inorganic salts, at the two respective temperature levels. Differential scanning calorimetry results revealed endothermic reactions, possibly due to dehydroxylation of clay, between temperatures of 480 and 600 degrees C, and calcite decomposition between the temperatures of 680 and 900 degrees C. Intensified endothermic peaks were observed in the mixes of the two materials. Thermal gravimetric analysis-infrared absorption spectrometry revealed increased intensities of the absorption bands at 1,600 cm(-1) at 630 degrees C and 2,900 cm(-1) at 710 degrees C, as a result of the breakdown of organic matter and alkanes, respectively. Energy demand analysis determined the energy required for raising the temperature of each mix to reach each specific temperature. The intrinsic energy required to raise the firing temperature of the aggregates from 400 to 900 degrees C was determined to be within the range of 20,347 and 38,254 kJ/kg, with 100% sludge exhibiting the lowest energy requirement and 20% sludge exhibiting the highest energy requirement.",2006
Distribution deviation of large aggregates from uniformity in waste containment concrete. I: Quantitative model formulation,concrete aggregate; imaging techniques; radiography; waste management; mixing; models,MEDIA; CLAY,"Even distribution of aggregate particles in matrices is the target of random mixing processes that are used in the preparation of construction materials to enhance the postplacement uniformity of characteristics. This is particularly important for waste containment barrier concrete where strength, durability, and minimal permeability are desirable. An index, herein referred to as the deviation index (DI) was developed and applied to the cross-sectional areas and volume elements of concrete containing large aggregate to describe distribution deviations of large aggregate particles from perfectly even volumetric distribution. The Poisson distribution and the goodness of fit test were used to describe deviations. Experimental results were obtained from concrete batching tests. designed and performed to compare two mixing methods (rodding and vibration) and a control. The results show no significant uneven distribution as the chi(2) values are less than 19.6 at 5% significance level. Within the bounds of these low deviation values, the rodded samples deviated the most, and had the highest DI values (22, volumetrically and 65.32, areally). Sequentially batched samples show minimal variability in DI, indicating that the batch mixing processes were consistent.",2006
Basic properties of vinylon fiber-reinforced porous concretes,porous concrete; fiber reinforcement; mix design; strength control factor,,"Porous concretes have been used as various construction materials. However, the flexural strength of the porous concrete is lower than that of the ordinary cement concrete because of its porous structure. The flexural strength of the porous concrete may be improved by fiber reinforcement. The purpose of this study is to investigate mix proportioning factors and strength properties of fiber-reinforced porous concretes. The fiber-reinforced porous concretes are prepared with various vinylon fibers contents and continuous voids contents, and subjected to compressive strength and flexural strength tests. The test results show that the percentage of absolute volume of the mixture of fibers and aggregates is an important factor in the mix design of the fiber-reinforced porous concrete to give the prescribed voids. The compressive and flexural strengths of the fiber-reinforced porous concretes are increased with an increase in the cement content and fibers content. The strength control factors of the fiber-reinforced porous concrete calculated from the volume percentage of the cement mortar as a binder, vinylon fibers and continuous voids are proposed.",2006
Use of concrete tanks for seasonal thermal storage: Behavior of cement mortars cured in water at temperatures 20-80 degrees C,thermal storage; concrete; warm water; durability,,"The use of non-metallic materials for the construction of thermal storage tanks may lead to the conservation of energy as well as the reduction of construction and maintenance cost. Concrete can be used as the main construction material, provided that problems associated with the temperature fluctuation (10-90 degrees C) are successfully met. The differentiation of temperature affects the mechanical properties, the durability and the thermal properties of the material. In the present work the behaviour of cement mortar specimens, cured in water at a temperature ranging from 20 degrees C to 80 degrees C, was studied. Mortar specimens of different compositions were constructed, using alternatively polypropylene fibers and air-entraining agent. Afterwards, the specimens were cured for 1 day at the laboratory environment and for 27 days in water. Then the specimens were cured in water at three different temperature conditions: 1) T=20 degrees C (reference conditions), 2) T=80 degrees C, 3) T=20-80 degrees C. The compressive strength, the specimens' mass, the ultrasonic pulse velocity and the sorptivity were measured. Results showed a significant strength loss of the specimens cured in water of elevated temperatures.",2006
Numerical simulations of explosive blast pressures during wall breaching,,,"During the past several years, the US Army has focused considerable attention toward developing improved methods for breaching walls and determining weapon-target interaction effects from direct- and indirect-fire weapons in the urban combat environment. A major thrust area is centered on developing methods for predicting the blast and fragmentation environment behind a breached wall. This information is important to the warfighter in terms of recognizing the expected impact on both enemy combatants, and non-combatants or friendly forces. One impediment to this effort is that little data exist to document the behind-wall blast environment produced by the detonation of explosives against or within walls. As part of the Army's effort, the US Army Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) is conducting experimental and numerical investigations to improve wall breaching methods. In the experimental and numerical programs, the ERDC will conduct comprehensive research on a full range of urban construction materials. As a first step in this process, the ERDC conducted a baseline study of C-4 breaching effectiveness against steel-reinforced-concrete (RC) walls. A goal of this effort was to better define the behind wall blast environment produced by various C-4 charges placed in contact with RC walls. Numerical simulations of selected experiments were conducted using the coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian code Zapotec. In these simulations, the concrete and reinforcing steel were modeled as Lagrangian materials, and the C-4 and air were modeled as Eulerian materials.",2006
The influence of construction material moisture on the indoor humidity and surface conditions,,,"Because of short construction periods the material moisture is a well known problem in new buildings. In many cases a high humidity in the indoor air causes mould growth and an increase of the heating costs.

The difference between mineral constructions with reinforced concrete, different timber constructions and mixed constructions, in which concrete construction parts fulfill static requirements and prefabricated wooden construction elements form the building shell will be discussed.",2006
Modeling the shock compression of concrete under 20 GPA,concrete; compaction; meso mechanics; modeling,,"The aim of the authors is to model the shock response of concrete structures submitted to the effects of projectile penetration or contact detonation, in a range of pressure levels from 0 to 20 GPA. The limitations of current computers imply the need to homogenize the response of the different constituents of concrete into a single macroscopic model. Though concrete is widely used as a construction material, the knowledge concerning its response under shock loading response remains rather modest. An exhaustive review of the research effort in this field shows that the limited available data is affected by an important dispersion. As a consequence, any general rule correlating the composition of concrete to its shock properties have not yet been evidenced. A simple method to predict the shock Hugoniot of concrete based on a mixture theory is developed considering concrete as a mix of cement hydrates, free water, rock and voids. Experimental results obtained on special concrete compositions are presented. They illustrate the relation between the wave structure and the size of the aggregates, and so, the level of heterogeneity of the composition. Numerical simulations demonstrate the ability of a mesoscopic model to describe this phenomenon, and the failure of the homogenized approach to do so.",2006

Autoclaved aerated concrete from fly ash and effects of fly ash composition,fly ash; Aerated Autoclave Concrete (AAC); Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFBC),,"Fly ash is a finely divide non-combustible material obtained as a by-product of coal combustion. It is a major by-product of coal based thermal power stations. Until recent past it was considered as a waste and highly polluting material. However its formation can only be minimized by using suitable technology in the boilers. In recent past it is found that Fly ash has many end uses and it has proven itself to be a potential construction material. But the suitability. of fly ash for various applications largely depends on the amount of unburned carbon, which is turn depends on the firing method. Fly ash samples from various power plants existing in India using a fluidized bed method and pulverized bed were analyzed and a comparison of these two firing methods was carried. This paper deals with the compositional requirements for fly ash used for the fabrication of insulating doors using AAC (Aerated Autoclave Concrete) and the methods employed to make fly ash suitable for this purpose. It also includes the latest 'U' beam technology for effective fly ash recycle. If the by products of coal combustion from power plants like fly ash as the paper stresses are utilized properly, it is not an exaggeration to say that power generation is possible with absolutely zero cost.",2006
Sensing properties of carbon fiber and hybrid fiber reinforced polymer bars as strain sensors,,COMPOSITE; DAMAGE; FRP,"Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) reinforcing bar has become more and more popular as construction material in civil engineering due to its advantages of corrosion-resistance, high strength, nom-nagnetic, fatigue-resistance and so on. As carbon fibers are electrical conductors, the measurement of the electrical resistance to be a valuable technique for the in situ detection. The carbon-fiber-reinforced-polymer rods (CFRP) can be considered as a self-monitoring material without additional sensing elements. The feasibility of hybrid-fiberreinforced-polymer rods (HFRP) that demonstrate the important safety features of self-monitoring capability and pseudo-ductility is demonstrated. The present paper addresses the correlation between mechanical damage and the change in electrical resistance of CFRP and HFRP bars under tensile loading.

The experimental results show that CFRP and HFRP bars are a wonderful construction material for civil engineering both as smart sensor and the reinforcing bars.",2006
Carbon pool and substitution effects of an increased use of wood in buildings in Switzerland: first estimates,wood products; substitution; sink; climate change; Kyoto protocol; life cycle assessment; GHG; CO(2),LIFE-CYCLE; PRODUCTS; SEQUESTRATION; FORESTS; TREES,"Long-living wood products can contribute to the mitigation of climate change in many ways. On the one hand, they act as a carbon pool during their service life, as they withdraw CO(2) from its natural cycle. After their service life, they can substitute for fossil fuels if they are incinerated in adequate furnaces. On the other hand, wood products can substitute for more energy intense products made of `conventional' materials. This paper quantifies the substitution and carbon pool effects of an increased use of wood in the building sector in Switzerland for the years 2000 - 2130. For this purpose, life cycle data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 12 wood products and their substitutes is used as proxies for the most important groups of building products used in construction and in interior works; this data is linked to the forecasted wood flows for each group of building products in a cohort-model. For the political assessment, GHG effects occurring abroad are distinguished from GHG effects occurring in Switzerland. The results show that the C-pool effect of an increased use of wood products with long service life is of minor importance; the substitution effects associated with the thermal use of industrial and post-consumer waste wood as well as with the substitution of `conventional' materials are much more relevant, especially on a long-term. For construction materials, the Swiss share of the GHG effect related to the material substitution is relatively high, as mainly nationally produced concrete, mineral wool, and bricks are substituted for. For products used in interior works, the Swiss share of the GHG effect related to the material substitution is rather small (or even negative for single products) because mainly imports are substituted, such as ceramic tiles or steel produced in the EU. The results are rough estimates. Nonetheless, these calculations show that an increased use of wood in the building sector is a valid and valuable option for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and for reaching GHG emission targets on a mid- to long-term basis. Still, the carbon storage and substitution capacity of an increased use of wood is relatively small compared to the overall greenhouse gas emissions of Switzerland.",2005

Gas-chromatographic separate determination of trace beta-chlorovinylarsonous dichloroanhydride (lewisite) and anhydride (lewisite oxide) in soil and construction materials,,,"A method was proposed for the separate gas-chromatographic determination of P-chlorovinylarsonous dichloroanhydride (lewisite) and anhydride (lewisite oxide) in samples of soil and construction materials. Because of the absence of regulations for the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of lewisite and lewisite oxide in construction materials (concrete, bricks, facing tile, etc.), the MPC level of lewisite in soil (0.1 mg/kg) was taken as the maximum permissible concentration in the development of the method for their determination in the above samples. The method is based on the solid-liquid extraction converting lewisite and lewisite oxide into components that can be separated at the stage of blowing-out the extractant in an inert gas flow and their subsequent conversion into acetylene with a 30% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide and the chromatography of the vapor phase with flame-ionization detection. The error in the determination is no larger than +/- 20 rel %. The time of analysis is within 1.5 h.",2005

Two types of approaches have been developed to obtain, from spectral measurements, estimates of the equivalent complex permittivity versus frequency or reconstruction of the impulse response. In particular, high-resolution (HR) algorithms based on the matrix pencil method have been used in an original way to identify wave multipath inside a sample. Both approaches have been used for the characterization of different types of building materials.

Behaviour of slurry infiltrated fibrous concrete (SIFCON) simply supported two-way slabs in flexure,,,"Slurry infiltrated fibre concrete (SIFCON) is one of the recently developed construction material. SIFCON could be considered as a special type of fibre concrete with high fibre content. The matrix consists of cement slurry or flowing cement mortar. This composite material has already been used for structures subjected to blast loading, repair of pre-stressed concrete beams and safe vaults(1). This paper presents the information on behaviour of two-way slabs in flexure.

An approach to the simulation of PCMs in building applications using TRNSYS,simulation; phase change material (PCM); thermal energy storage (TES); TRNSYS,PHASE-CHANGE; STORAGE,"The use of phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal storage in buildings was one of the first applications studied, together with typical storage tanks. An interesting possibility in building application is the impregnation of PCMs into porous construction materials, such as plasterboard or concrete, to increase thermal mass. The thermal improvements in a building due to the inclusion of PCMs depend on the climate, design and orientation of the construction, but also to the amount and type of PCM. Therefore, these projects require a complete simulation of the thermal behaviour of the designed space in the conditions of use established a priori. In this paper a simple methodology for the energetic simulation of buildings including elements with PCMs using the program TRNSYS is presented and validated. This procedure does not aim a simulation of the real transfer processes inside the materials with PCM, but to evaluate the influence of walls/ceiling/floor with PCM in the whole energy balance of a building. The key parameter in the simulations is the equivalent heat transfer coefficient which has to be determined for each material. Experimental evaluation of the coefficient is presented. The methodology is applied in a building such as a prototype room built with concrete panels with PCM. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2005
A damage index of generalised applicability,,,"Structural damage caused by earthquakes may be due to excessive deformations, or it may be in the form of accumulated damage sustained under repeated load reversals. The way these two components are combined is strictly dependent upon the structural material. Reinforced concrete structures, for instance, accumulate damage resulting from cyclic inelastic deformations in a way that is completely different from that for steel structures. Many attempts have been concentrated in the past on the verification of the possibility of using steel-type damage indices for reinforced concrete structures and vice versa. In spite of the good results that have been obtained in some cases, the applicability of these indices could not be generalised. The purpose of this paper is to obtain a uniform definition of damage, independently of the material used for the structure, so that practical design and assessment methods can be applied to any type of structure. It is shown that the damage in any construction material mainly results in strength deterioration. A general damage index is thus defined as the ratio between the initial and the reduced resistance capacity of a structure, evaluated by using an evolution equation for the yield strength in which the structural damageability is included. The ability of this index to model different damage situations is demonstrated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2005
Application of gray relational analysis to evaluate HMA with reclaimed building materials,variance analysis; asphalt mixes; asphalt pavements; recycling; construction materials,,"This study evaluates reclaimed building materials (RBM), including waste concrete, brick, and the, used as aggregate for hot mix asphalt (HMA). The analysis method of gray relational analysis (GRA) is presented to determine the best performance of the varying proportions of RBM with igneous crush stone (ICS) on HMA mixtures. Four types of aggregates are used for the mixtures: (a) 100% ICS; (b) 100% RBM; (c) 50% coarse and fine RBM plus 50% coarse and fine ICS (50% RBM plus 50% ICS); and (d) coarse RBM plus fine ICS (C-RBM plus F-ICS). Two types of asphalt cement, AC-10 and AC-20, are used as a binder for the mixtures. Laboratory tests of permanent deformation, resilient modulus, and stripping were evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) and GRA. On the basis of this study, the ANOVA of the permanent deformation test shows that the type of aggregate has a significant effect, no matter what test temperatures and binders are used. The ANOVA of the resilient modulus test shows that the types of binder and aggregate do not significantly affect at test temperatures of 25 degrees C, but significantly affect the types of binder at 40 degrees C. The GRA result indicates that the best performance is the C-RBM plus F-ICS mixtures. For the stripping test, all 4 mixture types satisfied the Agency's requirements.",2005
Lateral behaviour of composite tapered piles in dense sand,foundations; piles & piling,LOAD-TRANSFER,"When used in harsh environments and offshore applications, conventional pile materials (such as steel, timber and concrete) are prone to costly durability problems, such as corrosion in reinforced/prestressed concrete and steel shell piles. Fibreglass-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites provide a corrosion-resistant construction material. FRP-concrete composite piles have been used successfully over the last decade in several projects for fendering applications. This paper investigates the behaviour under lateral loading of FRP composite tapered and cylindrical piles filled with self-consolidating concrete (SCC) and driven in dense sand enclosed in a pressure chamber. Seventeen pile installations were conducted using toe driving and conventional head driving. The piles were subsequently subjected to static lateral load tests. The results show that the pile taper increased its lateral capacity and enhanced its overall performance. A taper coefficient, K-tl, was introduced to account for the taper effect on the lateral response of piles. The experimental results were compared with two commonly used approaches for the analysis of the lateral response of piles: the p-y curves approach and the strain wedge model (SWM). The taper coefficient can be easily incorporated in both methods to account for the effect of pile taper. The comparison between the measured and computed responses showed. that both the p-y curve approach and the SWM, modified using K-tl, can be used for the prediction of the lateral response of tapered piles.",2005
Utilization of secondary lead slag as construction material,slag; magnetic property; compressive strength; water absorption; porosity,CONCRETE; WATER; STRENGTH; CEMENT,"Secondary lead slag, a waste product from battery smelting using CaCO3 as flux, has been investigated for its use as an admixture and/ or aggregate in the production of concrete blocks. The slag was added as partial replacements of cement and/or aggregate. The results revealed that the oxide components of the slag were similar to those of ordinary Portland cement (OPC). The CaO content in the slag is 6.2 times less than that in OPC, while its iron content, as FeO, is 15.1 times higher. Interestingly, it also possesses magnetic property. All samples exhibited higher compressive strengths than that of the sample without slag (STD) which increased with increasing the slag contents and ages. The highest compressive strength was of the sample containing 20% slag as cement substituent and 100% slag as aggregate replacement owing to 259% of that of the STD at 60 days. All samples showed higher water absorption than that of the STD. The higher the slag contents, the more the water absorption. The absorption was, as expected, decreased with ages. Magnetic property of the slag plays an important role in the properties of the concrete blocks. For environmental concern, leachability of lead (Pb) from all samples was also carried out.

Use of asphalt roofing shingle waste in HMA,roofing shingle waste; recycling; hot-mix asphalt; rutting resistance,,"Like other construction materials, shingles have their own service life based on raw materials, production method and environmental and climatic conditions. At the end of their service life, shingles need to be replaced. However, these old shingles together with manufacturing scrap and handling waste require large storage areas and pollute the environment in time. Hence, additional usage of shingle waste is desirable. In this study, shingle waste in amounts of 1%, 2%, 3%, 4% and 5% by weight was added as an additive to asphalt concrete mixes prepared with the optimum binder content which yielded the best stability value was 5%. After determination of the optimum percentage of shingle to be added, rutting tests were performed on the specimens. Taking into account, the binder content existing in the shingle, mixtures were prepared with the reduced binder content by 0.5% and 1.0%. Test results show that waste shingles can be used in HMA as an additive to improve the Marshall stability and rutting resistance of the mixtures. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2005
Comparison of Environmental Effects of Steel- and Concrete-Framed Buildings,Buildings; Construction materials; Building frames; Energy consumption; Emissions; Life cycles,,"In order to create an environmentally-conscious building, the environmental impacts of the entire service life must be known. Life-cycle assessment (LCA), which evaluates the impacts from all life-cycle phases, from ""cradle to grave,"" is the best method to achieve this goal. In this paper, LCA is used to quantify the energy use and the environmental emissions during the construction phase of two typical office buildings, one with a structural steel frame and one with a cast-in-place concrete frame, and then these are put in the perspective of the overall service life of each building. The concrete structural-frame construction has more associated energy use, CO2, CO, NO2, particulate matter, SO2, and hydrocarbon emissions due to more formwork used, larger transportation impacts due to a larger mass of materials, and longer equipment use due to the longer installation process. In contrast, the steel-frame construction has more volatile organic compound (VOC) and heavy metal (Cr, Ni, Mn) emissions due to the painting, torch cutting, and welding of the steel members. The energy use and the environmental emissions of the two buildings are comparable if the total impacts from materials' manufacturing, construction, transportation, use, maintenance, and demolition are considered. Energy use and environmental emissions from office buildings can be reduced through a careful selection of embedded and temporary materials and construction equipment.",2005
Interface characteristics and laboratory constructability tests of novel fiber-reinforced polymer/concrete piles,,SAND; STRENGTH,"Conventional pile materials such as steel, concrete, and timber are prone to deterioration for many reasons. Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) concrete composites represent an alternative construction material for deep foundations that can eliminate many of the performance disadvantages of traditional piling materials. However, FRP composites present several difficulties related to constructability, and the lack of design tools for their implementation as a foundation element. This paper describes the results of an experimental study on frictional FRP/dense sand interface characteristics and the constructability of FRP-concrete composite piles. An innovative toe driving technique is developed to install the empty FRP shells in the soil and self-consolidating concrete is subsequently cast in them. The experimental program involves interface shear tests on small FRP samples and uplift load tests on large-scale model piles. Two different FRP pile materials with different roughness and a reference steel pile are examined. Static uplift load tests are conducted on different piles installed in soil samples subjected to different confining pressures in the pressure chamber. The results showed that the interface friction for FRP materials compared favorably with conventional steel material. It was shown that toe driving is suitable for installation of FRP piles in dense soils.",2005
Flexural behavior of reinforced concrete beams with cementitious repair materials,,,"There is an urgent need to develop efficient methods for the repairs and rehabilitation of currently existing structures, they are being deteriorated over time, and also the magnitude of loadings keeps rapidly increasing for such structures. Possibly one of the most challenging tasks in the rehabilitation processes is to upgrade the overall capacity of deteriorated concrete structures. Recently, considerable efforts are being directed toward developing new construction materials. This paper presents the experimental study for the flexural behavior of reinforced concrete beams repaired by Polymer Cement Mortar (PCM) and Ordinary Portland Cement Mortar (OPCM) in the tension region. Tests were performed for eight reinforced concrete beams with varying reinforcement ratios, repair materials and repair lengths. Emphasis is given to overall bending capacity, deflection, ductility index, failure mode and crack development of repaired beams. The results are compared with those from the control beam. 1359-5997 &COPY; 2004 RILEM. All rights reserved.",2005

Epifaunal colonization of the Loch Linnhe artificial reef: Influence of substratum on epifaunal assemblage structure,epifaunal colonisation; artificial reef; concrete; preservative treated wood; rubber; steel; PVC; species diversity; successional change,SESSILE MARINE-INVERTEBRATES; LARVAL SETTLEMENT; SUBTIDAL EPIBIOTA; FOULING COMMUNITY; ROCKY REEFS; POOLE-BAY; ORIENTATION; PERFORMANCE; SURFACES; HETEROGENEITY,"A one-year study was carried out off the west coast of Scotland to compare the epifaunal colonization of concrete material used in the construction of the Loch Linnhe artificial reef with that on four other types of artificial substrata ( preservative treated wood, rubber, steel and PVC). Settlement panels made from each of the materials were submerged in a vertical orientation during four seasonal exposure periods. There were clear seasonal trends across the four exposure periods with higher epifaunal biodiversity on all types of panel in the spring and summer exposure periods. Epifaunal assemblage structure was significantly different between the five types of material after each three-month exposure period. Concrete, preservative treated wood and PVC tended to have the highest species diversities. A successional study was also carried out. Over a 12-month exposure period epifaunal biodiversity increased on all five materials. After 12 months of exposure, the epifaunal assemblage structure was still significantly different between materials but had become more similar indicating a successional change towards a stable assemblage on all panels. The results indicate that material type and season have a significant effect on epifaunal assemblage structure after short ( three-month) periods of submersion but that these effects are reduced with increasing length of exposure. The study concludes that the choice of construction material for an artificial reef will have little effect on the long-term epifaunal community structure, as long as the material is physically stable, non-toxic and offers a high degree of habitat complexity.",2005
"Sustainable mud brick construction material in high-rise houses at Hadramout Valley, Yemen",construction; preservation; mud; clay straw,,"This paper emphasises on preservation and sustainable development of mud brick construction technology used in building traditional houses at Hadramout, Yemen. Most houses in this region are made from mud bricks, which have good thermal storage compared to modem building materials like concrete and cement brick. Mud brick is the oldest building material. It is a natural material and the most appropriate construction material in Hadramout due to the regional dry and hot climate, and this material is abundance in this region. This paper attempts to illustrate the construction process of mud brick houses. This mud brick material mixed with clay straw as reinforcing agent is used to build the magnificent high-rise houses, ranged from three to nine stories with load bearing mud brick walls construction system. It is the aim of this paper to search for the possibility of making use of this traditional construction technology to build for low-income houses. The uses of the material are able to sustain the traditional life style, and thermal comforts.

Electric arc furnace slag utilization,slag; by-products; recycling; roads; cement; construction materials; nickel metallurgy; electric furnace slag uses; waste management,,"This paper presents the research that General Mining and Metallurgical SA ""LARCO"" has carried out and their results, for using Electric Furnace Slag (EFS) in different applications as added value materials. The EFS produced by the company's activities amounts to approximately 2 million tones annually, the company to develop innovative ways for EFS management. Until now, small quantities, ranging from 20 to 30%, of EFS have been sold either to the cement producing industry, or as a sand-blasting material. The developed technology introduces new industrial applications that exploit this metallurgical by-product and minimize the environmental impact of activities related with nickel production. The main advantages would be the minimization of the environmental burden due to the deposition of the EFS and compliance with relevant regulations. Additionally, the full use of EFS as an aggregate substitute would significantly benefit the environment, as fewer raw materials, such as aggregates, would have to be extracted. So, more land would stay intact and less energy would be consummated in the ceramics, cement, and concrete and construction industry. The developed uses of the EFS include: 1. the use of the fine slag (60%, +0.5 -1.5) as a sand-blasting material 2. the use of slag as an inert additive in high strength concrete, in replacement of aggregates 3. the use of slag as an additive in Portland cement, due to its hydraulic properties 4. the use of slag instead of limestone aggregates in the light concrete for the construction of the base of roads 5. the use of slag to produce an anti-slippery blacktop material replacing 100% the limestone aggregates, as well as 6. the use of slag to produce anti-slippery pavement tiles. Also, other uses of slag are described which gave promising results, such as: 1. as an additive for the construction materials production (tiles, bricks), with an increase of about 40% of their mechanical strength without an increase of the roasting temperature 2. in the production of fire fighting bricks to be used in fireplaces or thermal accumulators, with good results 3. as Fetling material to be used in metallurgical smelting furnaces, with good results and last 4. in the production of high strength alumina cement.",2005
Design and analysis of a PVC seawall system for waterfront protection,Finite Element Analysis (FEA); joint analysis; construction/infrastructure,,"Seawalls are modular waterfront structures used for protection of shorelines from the surrounding water. Traditionally seawalls have been constructed using conventional construction materials (steel, reinforced concrete, wood, etc.) to provide massive protection to backshore areas during wave impacts and minimize land erosion. Seawalls also work in lower wave energy environments to separate land from water. Polymer composites are now being implemented for such use, considering that they have low density, possess high toughness, they are relatively inexpensive and some of them can withstand harsh environmental conditions. This study considers that specific guidelines for their detail design and use in this type of applications are not yet fully developed. A comprehensive study has been performed to determine the response of a specific sheet pile configuration to different loading conditions considering the interaction of soil parameters, structural loads, coupon mechanical testing and Finite Element Analysis of individual components and the system.",2005
Experimental study on the property change by strength of concrete mixed with wasted tire-chips,strength features; wasted tire; recycle,,"The management of waste and its recycling application is getting recognized as a very important element of modem society as environmental pollution problems emerge. Since it is hard to secure right places to bum up or landfill those wastes and has chances of making conflicts with the neighborhoods and damaging our environment. To minimize and recycle of the wastes are considered as the most effective way. During the past, despite quantities of wasted tires are quite large, there was no fundamental system to deal with the wasted tires which resulted in recycling of just few of them. Thus, it is considered that recycling of enormous quantities of wasted tires for construction materials has significant meaning in saving and recycling resources. In this study, it is my purpose to show how much there will be influence to the strength by mixing powders of wasted tires into regular remicon with respect of effectiveness in durability, applicability, economic aspect, and workability, to put it to practical use and to use as basic data from a view of recycling wasted tires as construction materials. For the wasted tires mixed with powders of wasted tire, the higher quantity of mixture was made, the less value of slump was recorded. And the concrete, which was mixed with 10mm particles with ratio of 0.5% and 1.0% each at 270 of mixture strength, was reduced by 27% in slump value when mixed with other particles, whereas concrete mixed with 10mm particles showed lower decrease ratio compared to the former by reducing only 1.0%-1.5%. The value of flexural strength was increased with ratios of wasted tire particles mixture of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5% in RC. It is estimated that as mixing quantities of wasted tire particles increase, microscopic air gaps form at interfaces between wasted tire particles, lowering strength in result.",2005
Modeling and implementation of VARTM for civil engineering applications,,,"The use of composite materials in civil engineering applications has been growing at a fast pace for the last decade. Design and building codes for composite structures have been written and approved to a point where consulting companies across the United States and abroad are applying in practice. The technology has been implemented in primary and secondary structural members for design and retrofit. It has also been demonstrated that the use of composites in combination with conventional construction materials has a synergetic effect that can be exploited positively. Processing of composite materials in the field has proven to be a challenge for the construction industry. Thermoset resins, mainly vinyl ester and epoxies pose a safety hazard for workers due to volatile emissions, long curing times, exotherm issues, and proper handling on site. In the case of structural retrofitting and rehabilitation, Vacuum Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) is a processing technology that belongs to the liquid molding family of processes and is still under development for civil engineering applications. In order to successfully implement VARTM in the field, processing parameters such as - amount of resin, curing times, filling time, and permeability of the fibers need to be calculated effectively before attempting to repair a structural member. In the present work we have used a finite element (FE) based software, RTM-Worx (Koorevaar, 2002) to simulate liquid molding processes useful processing guidelines for in-field applications. This paper addresses the FE analysis of VARTM and experimental validation for two large-scale scenarios representing infrastructure applications. First, the infusion of an autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) beam wrapped with carbon fabric is simulated and compared to the experimental results. Second, the use of VARTM on a full scale high strength concrete T-bulb girder reinforced with unidirectional carbon fabric is simulated and compared to on-site implementation. The results show excellent agreement between the RTM-Worx generated resin flow information and the experiments for both the AAC and the T-bulb girder application.",2005
Structural health monitoring systems for bridge decks and rehabilitated precast prestress concrete beams,structural health monitoring system; bridge decks; fiber reinforced polymers; rehabilitation; and precast prestress beams,,"Bridges are an integral part of a highway network and represent a multi-billion dollar investment. It is imperative that they are always open to traffic, resistant to natural disaster, and undaunted by millions of loading cycles per year. However, bridges are expensive to maintain and do occasionally fail. Early signs of deterioration are often not seen because concrete, some type of deck overlay, paint, protective wrap or other bridge components mask them. During service of bridge construction materials are subjected to degradation by aging; concrete cracks and creeps, steel oxides and may crack due to fatigue loading. The degradation of materials is caused by mechanical (loads higher then theoretically assumed) and physico-chemical factors (corrosion of steel, penetration of salts and chlorides in concrete, freezing of concrete etc.). As a consequence of material degradation, the capacity, durability and safety of structure decrease. Structural health monitoring is the diagnostic monitoring of the integrity or condition of a structure. The intent is to detect and locate damage or degradation in structural components and to provide this information quickly and in a form easily understood by the operators or occupants of the structure. In this study, a long-term structural health monitoring program was developed to identify any changes in the condition of the rehabilitated precast prestressed beams with CFRP over time due to sustained loads, traffic loads, and environmental exposure and to examine the performance of full-scale precast bridge deck under static and fatigue loading.",2005
Thermal treatment of moisture damaged construction,moisture damage; arising moisture; retrofitting of damaged construction; thermal treatment,,"The reason for the destruction of stones and elements of construction is the moisture which penetrates into the pores and destabilizes through several processes, the matrix of the construction material in the case of the moisture content of the materials is too high. The moisture content is a result of the moistening and drying processes. The frequency and quantity of this process determines the amount of moisture in a construction element. If this balance is changed, for example by increased evaporation, the moisture load will be lower and the moisture state of the construction eventually becomes harmless. In this paper the results of investigations will be presented by using a heating system in exterior and partition walls which suffer from arising moisture. The temperature of these elements increases by only a few degrees, about the temperature level of the environment to support the evaporation. The findings of this investigation are the temperature influences on capillary suction strength, viscosity, evaporation and so on. It is clear that in the case of high moisture load and low evaporation the drying effect by thermal treatment is low and in the opposite case this method will be very successful. The aim of this investigation is to find out and show the possibilities of this method, the boundary conditions of the application and the efficiency of this method. The result of the investigations is quantification of the influence of the material properties and the moisture load from subsoil and soil water on the humidification. The method is relatively successful in the case of sandstone, limestone, lime sandstone, and gas aerated concrete. For elements made of bricks this method cannot be recommended.",2005
Measurement of cement porosity by centroid frequency profiles of ultrasonic grain noise,non-destructive evaluation; ultrasonics; grain noise; centroid frequency; cement porosity,SIGNAL CHARACTERIZATION; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; ATTENUATION; IMAGES; PULSES,"In this paper, we propose a technique for material characterization by using centroid frequency profiles (CFP) of ultrasound echo signals. These echo signals are composed by grain noise due to the superposition of many small echoes from the inner microstructure plus observation noise. A CFP indicates the centroid frequency dependence on depth, corresponding to power spectrum density assessments at different depths. We show in the paper the relation between the mean and variance of the CFP and the grain-to-observation-noise-ratio (GDR) at every depth. The GOR depends on the material ultrasound attenuation, so that CFP may be used for material characterization. Although we consider here the estimation of cement paste porosity, the proposed technique may have general applicability. Cement paste is the main component of mortar and concrete. Therefore, cement porosity is an important problem because the vulnerability (and thence the durability) of these construction materials to external agents depends heavily on it. Experiments have been made to show the correlation between cement paste porosity and a penetration parameter obtained from the CFP. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2004

"Evaluation of selected basalts from Nigde, Turkey, as source of concrete aggregate",basalt; petrographical characteristics; aggregate quality; Turkey,,"Basaltic rocks have been widely used as aggregate for various purposes. They show a variety of textural and mineralogical characteristics that may affect their physico-mechanical properties as well as their use as construction material. The study presented in this paper was carried out on basalts that are widespread in the Middle Anatolian Region of Turkey and that comprise the major source of local crushed rock aggregates. To determine the suitability of the basalts as alternative aggregate resource, Early Quaternary Melendiz Volcanites, Quaternary Karatas volcanites and Igredak basalts were selected around the Nigde Region. The experimental studies were conducted on these rocks. The samples were collected as being representative of 11 different types of basalt. The physico-mechanical properties of the basalts of different compositions and textures, and the properties of their aggregates were determined. The results were then compared with the typical acceptance limits in international usage. Although olivine basalts have better aggregate quality compared to other basalts, most of the basalts were found to be suitable for production of crushed rock aggregates for concrete production.

GFRG can be used as various structural elements, such as walls and slabs. GFRG, in its short life, without extensive product development and comprehensive structural design guidelines, has been used as the principal wall construction material in more than 3,000 dwellings across Australia. As GFRG walls find more and more applications and interests in the building industry in Australia as well as in other countries, comprehensive structural design guidelines for GFRG walls and their building system have become necessary.

The strength activity index with Portland cement and the effectiveness of pumice admixture as cement additive in controlling alkali-silica reactions and autoclave expansion, satisfied the ASTM requirements. The utilization of VP as a heat-insulating material was tested and the results were also found to satisfy the ASTM requirements.

Influence of fiber-reinforced concrete on radon concentrations,,EXHALATION RATES; SOILS; DIFFUSION; MOISTURE,"The influence of construction materials on the atmospheric radon concentration in an underground facility at the Nevada Test Site was examined. Radon (Rn-222 only) concentrations within the supporting fiber-reinforced concrete (fibercrete) and the native soil were quantified and compared. The average activity concentrations of (222) Rn were 39 +/- 1 and 12 +/- 1 Bq kg(-1) for the native soil and fibcrcrete, respectively. The average emanation coefficients of Rn-222, measured via Lucas cell scintillation, were significantly higher for the cured fibercrete at 0.078 +/- 0.029, than for the dried native soil at 0.0053 +/- 0.0006. The. emanation coefficient for the in situ native soil is estimated to be 0.020 +/- 0.004. In situ exhalation rates were also determined using passive-diffusion charcoal canisters. The average exhalation rate for the native material surface was 5.8 +/- 0.6 mBq m(-2) s(-1). This was significantly higher (p=9 X 10(-5)) than for the fibercrete surface, which exhibited an average exhalation rate of 2.7 +/- 0.7 mBq m(-2) S-1. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the addition of fibercrete to wall surfaces reduces the radon concentration in this underground environment.",2004

Accelerated AC impedance testing for prequalification of marine construction materials,AC impedance technique; concrete corrosion inhibitor; pozolanic admixtures; desalination plants; concrete oil and water piers; concrete rebar corrosion evaluation,CONCRETE,"The AC impedance technique was used in this study for the evaluation and prequalification of concrete materials prepared with chemical corrosion inhibitors and pozolanic admixtures of GGBS slag. In the Arabian Gulf region, marine seawater corrosion has caused severe concrete deterioration over the past decades. Major industrial buildings such as power generation plants, desalination plants and off-shore structures, and oil or water piers deteriorate severely in the marine industrial seawater environment due to the deleterious effect of chloride ions and CO, gas. It has only recently been appreciated in this difficult region that concrete with supplementary cementing materials exhibit a very significant reduction in permeability and corrosion effects. Assessment of the corrosion condition of steel rebar in concrete for newly proposed projects can be carried out with different techniques. Most of the testing methods suggested are based on the ASTM standards G-109, ASTM C876, and ASTM C1202. The duration for ASTM testing requires at least a minimum of 1 to 3 years of exposure in simulated weathering conditions before any reliable conclusion can be drawn. In the present study, accelerated AC impedance measurements were carried out over a wide frequency range on reinforced Lollipop specimens of GGBS slag with different degrees of compaction of the concrete mix. The AC impedance technique allows detection of the breakdown of passivity and performance of the steel reinforcement in concrete within a much shorter time than with other tests. The correlation between the AC impedance technique and traditional ASTM standards indicated concurring results of the benefit of the application of multicomponent corrosion protection systems under the prevailing conditions of the marine environment in the Arabian Gulf region.",2004

Thermo physical characteristics of economical building materials,lateritic soil bricks; pozzolans; thermophysical properties,CONCRETE; BRICKS; MORTAR,"An experimental study was carried out in order to determine the properties of local materials used as construction materials. Cement stabilized compressed bricks were tested. The thermal properties of lateritic soil based materials were determined. The objectives of work reported in this paper are to determine the effect of addition of pozzolan or sawdust in lateritic soil brick on the thermal properties. It was shown that the effect of incorporation of pozzolan or sawdust is the decreasing of the thermal conductivity and density. The moisture content of these materials can modify their thermal performance. Thus a study of the influence of the water content on the thermal conductivity k and the thermal diffusivity a is presented. The thermal conductivity as a function of water content increases rapidly between 0 and 12% for lateritic soil. The thermal diffusivity curve presents a maximum for values of water content of 15% for lateritic soil and 8% for lateritic soil-pozzolan or lateritic soil-sawdust. However, the composite materials used for building shielding must present Sufficient mechanical strength to be suitable for constructions. According to the experimental results the effect of adding cement or pozzolanic stabiliser is expressed in increase of strength of samples studied. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2004
Dynamic three-dimensional visualization of fluid construction materials,simulation; construction materials; computer graphics; particles; fluid dynamics,OPERATIONS,"The presented work extends the state-of-the-art of visualizing discrete-event construction simulations in three dimensions (31)). Efficient methods are presented along with a tool, ParticleWorks, that can be used to animate simulated construction processes that involve unstructured, fluid construction materials as resources or byproducts. Common construction processes that involve such fluid materials include placing concrete, dumping dirt, shotcreting, sandblasting, dewatering, water distribution, and inserting slurry. The writers capitalize on a classical computer graphics concept called particle systems to design simple, simulation model-authorable, parametric-text methods that can describe arbitrary volumes of dynamic fluid construction materials in animated 3D virtual construction worlds. These methods can be used to instrument discrete-event simulation models (or other external authoring interfaces) to automatically generate dynamic visualizations of any modeled construction operations that commonly handle and process fluid construction materials.",2004
Permeable porosity and thermal conductivity of conductivity materials,thermal properties; porosity; construction materials; models,CONCRETE; POROSIMETRY; MODEL,"Water permeable porosities and thermal conductivity of ceramic construction materials have been experimentally determined in this work. The samples were selected so as to obtain a wide variation in their apparent porosity. To study the influence of porosity on thermal conductivity, thermal conductivities of all the samples were measured in oven dried and water saturated conditions. A model relating porosity with thermal conductivity of these materials is proposed. In the model, two types of pores are hypothesized, namely; enclosed pores and enclosing pores. The three-dimensional steady-state heat transfer through unit cells containing each of the two types of pores, is solved to evaluate their effective thermal conductivity. By using the law of mixture for the random distribution of the type of pores, an equation combining the conductivities of the two cells is framed to get overall effective thermal conductivity of the material, in both dry and saturated states. The experimentally determined values of thermal conductivities reported in literature for some bricks are then compared with those predicted through this model.",2004
What it takes to convert prestressed concrete into a preferred construction material,,,"The late Art Anderson, co-founder of Concrete Technology Corporation and ABAM Engineers, Inc., Tacoma, Washington, was a visionary and a major pioneer of the precast, prestressed concrete industry. After obtaining a BS degree in civil engineering from the University of Washington, he went on to earn a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In 1949, he performed the instrumentation of the prototype girder for the Walnut Lane Bridge. He then became famous for designing and building some of the most imaginative prestressed concrete structures such as the 21-story Norton Building, the Disney Monorail and the ARCO floating vessel. Later, Dr. Anderson served as president of both the ACI and PCI. A prolific writer, he was the author of numerous technical papers, many of which appeared in the PCI JOURNAL. In recognition of Anderson's enormous contributions to the industry and Institute, PCI awarded him the Medal of Honor and Fellow Award.

Oyster shell as substitute for aggregate in mortar,oyster shell; mortar; unconfined compressive strength; fly ash; ethylbenzene; wmr 674-3,STRENGTH; CONCRETE,"Enormous amounts of oyster shell waste have been illegally disposed of at oyster farm sites along the southern coast of Korea. In this study to evaluate the possibility of recycling this waste for use as a construction material, the mechanical characteristics Of Pulverized oyster shell were investigated in terms of its potential utilization as a substitute for the aggregates used in mortar. The unconfined compressive strengths of various soil mortar specimens, with varying blending ratios of cement, water and oyster shell, were evaluated by performing unconfined compression tests, and the results were compared with the strengths of normal cement mortar made with sand. In addition, the effect of organic chemicals on the hardening of concrete was evaluated by preparing ethyl-benzene-mixed mortar specimens. The long-term strength improvement resulting from the addition of fly ash was also examined by performing unconfined compression tests on specimens with fly-ash content. There was no significant reduction in the compressive strength of the mortars containing small oyster shell particles instead of sand. From these test data, the possible application of oyster shells in construction materials could be verified, and the change in the strength parameters according to the presence of organic Compounds was also evaluated.",2004
Construction materials: From innovation to conservation,cement; cohesion; concrete; construction materials; flow modeling; granular materials; photocatalysis; raw earth; self-cleaning materials; rheology; wood,,"This article serves to introduce the May 2004 issue of MRS Bulletin on Construction Materials: From Innovation to Conservation. By volume, building materials are by far the most widely used type of materials. The most common construction materials-concrete and wood-are paradigms of complex and hierarchical materials, with a microstructure extending quasi-continuously down to the nanoscale. In the past, most improvements have been obtained by modifying the microstructure at the largest scales, for instance, by reducing the macroporosity. Recent advances in our understanding of the interactions and microstructure development show that the major levers for improvement from now on will rely on surface and colloid science and the science of complex materials, often at the nanoscale. This can lead to remarkable properties, such as self-compaction and ultrahigh strength, and even new functionality, such as self-cleaning through photocatalysis. Construction materials face a wide range of challenges today, many of which are linked to the need for more sustainable development: reducing the consumption of raw materials, reducing the energy used in processing, and increasing service life. In many parts of the world, there is also an increasing need to repair, rehabilitate, and conserve old buildings. The articles in this issue touch on these challenges as well as the advances being made in construction materials through materials research.",2004
The rheology of cementitious materials,cement; colloids; construction materials; rheology; aggregates,DISSIPATIVE PARTICLE DYNAMICS; SUSPENSIONS; CONCRETE; PASTES,"The introduction of a new generation of dispersants in concrete allow this material to exhibit self-compacting properties in its fresh state and high durability and mechanical strength in its hardened state. These properties translate into many practical advantages for the construction field. Two of the most important are reducing the ecological impact of this sector of industry and reducing the labor-intensive work associated with placing ordinary concrete by vibration. In this article, it will be shown that knowledge of colloidal science has proven essential in the development of this new generation of dispersants for concrete. Indeed, the polymer molecules used in these dispersants are specifically designed to induce steric repulsion between cement particles, reducing their agglomeration and allowing high workability of fresh concrete prior to setting. While the linkage between interparticle forces and the rheological behavior of cement pastes is still only semiquantitative, recent advances in the modeling of concrete rheology show very promising results in terms of handling aggregates with a wide distribution of particle sizes and shapes. However, accurate modeling requires reliable input on the interaction of the dispersant with the hydrating cement at the molecular level, which is identified as, a future research challenge.",2004

When scrutinized at the micro- or nanoscopic level, the continuity of the ionic-covalent bonding in the solid phase is interrupted almost everywhere by water molecules or liquid water films. The same situation is found in set plaster. Yet, plaster and cementitious materials are able to withstand stresses of the same order of magnitude as rocks. Molecular simulation studies and direct-force measurements by atomic force microscopy provide strong arguments for predicting that short- and medium-range surface forces mediated by partially or totally hydrated calcium ions are the essential components of cement strength, with additional contributions from van der Waals and capillary forces. This provides a clue for understanding the nano- and mesostructure of cement-based materials and new levers for improving their properties.",2004
Photocatalysis of cementitious materials: Clean buildings and clean air,cement; construction materials; photocatalysis; NOx; urban pollutants; self-cleaning concrete,SURFACES,"While the primary function of concrete is structural, its pervasiveness in our society lends it to other functions and creates the need for it to maintain its integrity and aesthetic quality. Therefore, concrete with added functionality-for example, self-cleaning characteristics and the ability to remove pollutants-is desirable. Heterogeneous photocatalysis (e.g., gas-solid or liquid-solid catalytic processes caused by light irradiation) by semiconductor particles or coatings has now reached a high level of development and is a promising technology for the reduction of global environmental pollutants. Among the various semiconductor materials, TiO2 in the form of anatase has attracted wide interest, due to its strong oxidizing power under near-UV radiation, its chemical stability when exposed to acidic and basic compounds, its chemical inertness in the absence of UV light, and the absence of toxicity. TiO2 has proved very effective in the reduction of pollutants such as NOx, aromatics, ammonia, and aldehydes. Surprisingly, the use of TiO2 in combination with cementitious materials has shown a favorable synergistic effect in the reduction of pollutants. These new materials have already found relevant applications in self-cleaning building walls and in the reduction of urban pollutants.",2004
Concrete from an agricultural waste-oil palm shell (OPS),oil palm shell (OPS); lightweight concrete; mix design; compressive strength; slab deflection,LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE; KERNEL SHELL,Wastes are produced in large quantities from agro-based industries and the use of these waste materials in construction industry would contribute towards a cleaner environment. It also results in a cost effective construction material. A concrete using oil palm shell (OPS) as coarse aggregate has been found useful as structural concrete. As the bulk density of OPS is much less than stone aggregate OPS concrete becomes a lightweight concrete with a density of about 1850 kg/m(3). The compressive strengths of OPS concrete range from 20 to 24 N/mm(2) for 28 days; this satisfies the strength requirement of structural lightweight concrete. A test on concrete floor slab using OPS concrete is also discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.,2004
Predicting long-term durability of steel reinforced concrete with calcium nitrite corrosion inhibitor,concrete; durability; corrosion; life prediction; corrosion inhibitor; calcium nitrite; steel reinforcing; modeling; design life,CHLORIDE; CEMENT,"Steel reinforced concrete is one of the most durable and cost effective construction materials, but it can suffer in high chloride environments from corrosion due to chloride induced breakdown of the normal passive layer protecting the steel. One way of protecting embedded steel reinforcement from chloride induced corrosion is by the addition of corrosion inhibiting admixtures. The most widely used corrosion inhibiting admixture is calcium nitrite, due to its excellent inhibitor properties and its benign effect on concrete properties. One advantage to calcium nitrite is that its protection mechanism is well defined. In this paper data are presented that show the levels of chloride to which given levels of calcium nitrite will protect. Furthermore, it will be shown that once corrosion initiates, the rates are lower with calcium nitrite present. Finally, it is demonstrated how these results can be used by the design engineer in an integrated durability model to produce reinforced concrete structures with durabilities in excess of 50-100 years.

Investigation of minimum longitudinal reinforcement requirements for concrete columns using present-day construction materials,column; creep; high-performance concrete; high-strength concrete; reinforced concrete; reinforcement; shrinkage,,"A research project was conducted to assess the feasibility of reducing the current ACI Building Code and AASHTO Bridge Specification requirements for minimum longitudinal reinforcing steel in columns. The current code requirement is based primarily on research conducted in the 1920s and 1930s on concrete with a compressive strength generally less than 34.5 MPa (5000 psi). The investigation was conducted to determine the effects of present-day construction materials on minimum reinforcement requirements. A research program was carried out that included: 1) fabrication and long-term loading and monitoring of 24, 8-in. diameter by 4-ft long reinforced concrete column specimens; 2) fabrication of reduced-humidity enclosures for storage of all specimens throughout the test program; and 3) long-term monitoring of 14 unloaded companion specimens. Test variables included concrete strength and reinforcement ratio. All loaded specimens were subjected to a nominal compressive force of 0.40f(c)'/A(g). The long-term response of concentrically loaded and unloaded specimens is presented in this paper, and measured responses are compared with predicted long-term responses based on recommendations from ACI Committee 209.",2004
Hardened properties of self-compacting concrete,self-compacting concrete; hardened concrete properties; tensile strength; modulus of elasticity; creep and shrinkage; bond behaviour,,"Self-compacting concrete (SCC) is an innovative construction material with a favourable theological behaviour, which is caused in the modified concrete composition. Based on this fact SCC offers improved proper-ties and therefore many advantages regarding the productivity and the design potential compared with normal vibrated concrete.

In this context it has to be clarified, if it is possible to apply the current design rules, e.g. Model Code 90 and Eurocode 2, based on years of experience on normal vibrated concrete, to structural members made of SCC as well.

More than 10 million people are currently living in Beijing. This city faces severe anthropogenic air pollution caused by an intense vehicle increase (11% per year in China),coal combusting power plants, heavy industry, huge numbers of household and restaurant cookers, and domestic heating stoves. Additionally, each year dust storms are carrying particulate matter from the deserts of Gobi and Takla Makan towards Beijing, especially in spring. Other geogenic sources of particulate matter which contribute to the air pollution are bare soils, coal heaps and construction sites occurring in and around Beijing. Streets function as receptor surfaces for atmospheric dusts. Thus, street sediments consist of particles of different chemical compositions from many different sources, such as traffic, road side soils and industry. Methods. Distributions and concentrations of various chemical elements in street sediments were investigated along a rural-urban transect in Beijing, China. Chemical elements were determined with X-ray fluorescence analysis. Factor analysis was used to extract most important element sources contributing to particulate pollution along a main arterial route of the Chinese capital. Results and Discussion. The statistical evaluation of the data by factor analysis identifies three main anthropogenic sources responsible for the contamination of Beijing street sediments. The first source is a steel factory in the western part of Beijing. From this source, Mn, Fe, and Ti were emitted into the atmosphere through chimneys and by wind from coal heaps used as the primary energy source for the factory. The second source is a combination of traffic, domestic heating and some small factories in the center of Beijing discharging Cu, Pb, Zn and Sn. Calcium and Cr characterize a third anthropogenic element source of construction materials such as concrete and mortar. Beside the anthropogenic contamination, some elements like Y, Zr, Nb, Cc, and Rb are mainly derived from natural soils and from the deserts. This is supported by mineral phase analysis, which showed a clear imprint of material in road dusts coining from the West-China deserts. Conclusions. Our results clearly show that the chemical composition of urban road dusts can be used to identify distinct sources responsible for their contamination. The study demonstrates that the chemistry of road dusts is an important monitor to assess the contamination in the urban environment. Chemical composition of street sediments in Beijing comprises the information of different sources of atmospheric particles. Recommendations and Outlook. This study is only a small contribution to the understanding of substance fluxes related to Beijing's dust. More effort is required to assess Beijing's dust fluxes, since the dust harms the living quality of the inhabitants. Especially the measurable superimposing of long scale transported dust from dry regions with the anthropogenic polluted urban dust makes investigations of Beijing's dust scientifically valuable.",2004
Utilization of ceramic wastes in the construction sector,ceramic mud wastes; crushed ceramic tile wastes; ceramic tile dust wastes,,"Ceramic wastes causing a serious problem are polluting the environmental problem in Eskisehir Region, Turkey.

Geopolymer concrete for a sustainable future,,,"The manufacture of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is not only energy-intensive but also releases a significant volume of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. In addition, OPC in concrete often causes premature deterioration that affects the durability of concrete structures. This paper explores an alternative to OPC concrete called geopolymer concrete. The present research utilises low calcium (class F) fly ash as the source material to produce geopolymer concrete. Several factors that affect the mix design process such as mix proportion. curing time, and curing temperature have been studied. In addition, the long-term properties such as drying shrinkage, creep, and exposure to sulfate attack are also being investigated. The test data presented in this paper reveal that geopolymer concrete possesses high compressive strength, undergoes very little drying shrinkage and moderately low creep, and shows excellent resistance to sulfate attack. The result is extremely promising and demonstrates the sustainability of geopolymer concrete as a construction material for a sustainable future.",2004

This paper also presents a discussion of the economics of using high performance lightweight concrete on the Rugsund Bridge. It also describes the Sundoy Bridge, the second bridge in Norway to utilize pumping for lightweight concrete placement. These projects confirm that high strength lightweight concrete is an economical, efficient construction material for long span bridges. While lightweight concrete may cost more per cubic yard than normalweight concrete, the structure may cost less as a result of reduced dead weight and lower foundation costs (1).",2004

When scrutinized at very microscopic level, continuity or the ionic-covalent bonding in the solid phase is almost everywhere interrupted by water molecules or liquid water films of variable thickness. Yet, concrete and cement pastes are able to withstand stresses of the same magnitude as rocks. The purpose of this paper to explore the possible reasons for such a high cohesion in terms of inter-particle forces using general arguments and molecular simulation computations including ab initio quantum chemical methods applied to C-S-H. As it will be discussed, molecular simulation studies provide strong arguments for predicting that short- and medium-range attractive electrostatic forces are the essential components of the cohesion of C-S-H with, at short distance (sub-nm), a significant iono-covalent contribution involving strongly localized calcium ions and water molecules and, at larger distance (a few nm), ionic correlation forces involving hydrated and mobile calcium ions in liquid water films. Only a marginal contribution is expected from van der Waals attraction whereas capillary forces might contribute at a level comparable to that of correlation forces in unsaturated conditions. The parallel with clay-based carthen construction materials is part of the clue or this rationale.",2004
Waste-to-energy residues - The search for beneficial uses,waste-to-energy; WTE; MSW combustion; beneficial use; bottom ash; fly ash; combined ash,ASH; INCINERATION; CONCRETE,"In the U.S., about 28.5 million tons of municipal solid waste are combusted annually in waste-to-energy facilities that generate 25-30% of ash by weight of the MSW feed. Since some residues were found to contain high levels of lead and cadmium prior to the 1990s, they were commonly associated with environmental pollution. However, for the last years nearly all ash samples have been tested non-hazardous. Research on the beneficial use of combustion residue has been conducted for the past few decades yet the actual ash reuse rate in the U.S. has remained close to 10%. Currently most of the ash is landfilled at considerable cost to the waste-to-energy industry. A consortium of researchers at Columbia University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Temple University, and other institutions seeks to develop and to advance the beneficial uses of combustion residues, such as in construction materials or remediation of contaminated abandoned mines and brownfields.

Unquestionably, it was the painstaking pioneering work of Freyssinet that convinced the engineering world of the viability of prestressed concrete as a competitive construction material. Throughout Freyssinet's life, there is one theme that keeps recurring time and again, namely, ""a simplification of forms and an economy of means. ""Magnel is noted, as a great teacher and for communicating his ideas on prestressing to the English-speaking world. Finsterwalder pioneered the development of the double cantilever method of bridge construction.

A four-parameter multi-axial strength criterion for lightweight aggregate (LWA) concrete,LWA concrete; strength criterion; multi-axial stress; ultimate strength surface,,"Concrete utilized in engineering structures is usually subject to the action of multi-axial stress. The strength theory of concrete is significant to structure design and saving of construction material. Experimental results have revealed that lightweight aggregate (LWA) concrete represents platform flow plasticity under high compressive stress. The ultimate strength surface of LWA concrete under multi-axial stress intersects with the hydrostatic stress axis at two different points, which is completely different from that of the normal concrete as the ultimate strength surface is open-ended. So the strength criterion aimed at normal concrete cannot fit LWA concrete. In this paper, a four-parameter multi-axial strength criterion for LWA concrete is presented. The strength envelope of the proposed model in the deviatoric plane adopted elliptic curve similar to that of Willam-Warnke model, and the tensile and compressive meridians are represented by quadratic functions with four parameters. Two methods can be used for the determination of the four parameters and their merits and drawbacks are compared by the analysis of experimental data.",2004
Which is better? Steel or reinforced concrete bridges: A life cycle assessment-based comparison,life cycle analysis; EIO-LCA; sustainable development,,"Material selection is an important part of bridge design and is usually determined by the economic criteria of the design project. As more environmental problems have attracted the attention of the construction industry, there is a need to design our bridges to be more environmental friendly. The ""green design"" concept requires an assessment of the entire life cycle of a structural system in order to identify the system that has the least environmental impact. In this project, two bridge alternatives that have the same location and function but are made of different construction materials are studied. Activities associated with the life cycle of the bridge are examined and a life cycle inventory analysis is performed concentrating on the boundary definition for this project. From the results of this study, the life cycle analysis induces a conflict in bridge design which indicates that the actually built steel bridge has higher environmental effects than that of the concrete bridge. However, results from a LCA study should always be carefully evaluated due to the limitations of the analysis model and it is of great importance that a standardized procedure and guideline for ""sustainable thinking in bridge design"" should be established and incorporated in the future.",2004
The distribution and evaluation of sulfur species in geological materials and manmade fills,sulfur species evaluation; pyrite; sulfate; assessment for structural backfills,WEATHERING PROCESSES; CLAY,"Groundwaters containing acidity and/or dissolved sulfate species are a primary factor in the attack on concrete and other construction materials. In the case of concrete, attack may be prevented by the use of suitably resistant concrete, eliminating sources of acidity and/or sulfate ions or by protecting the concrete structure from the offending solutions. Official guidelines, which have recently been modified to take account of the possible formation of sulfate and acidity after construction, are provided for the design of concrete structures to be placed in potentially aggressive situations. Limiting values for sulfates and other chemical species are also given for highway, road and bridge structures, but recent problems involving buried galvanised steel structures have highlighted the need for revised procedures to be put in place. Potential sources of aggressive solutions include the ground surrounding the structure and the construction materials, including fills, situated proximally to the structure. Unfortunately the current British Standard testing procedures are unsuitable for the purpose of assessing the potential aggressive nature of the ground and construction materials, hence risk assessments prove inadequate. This paper considers potential sources of ground acidity and sulfate rich solutions. Attention is given to suitable testing procedures for the evaluation of sulfur species in geological and construction materials. Particular attention is given to limiting values appropriate to the use of buried steel that forms part of highway, road and bridge structures. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2003

Numerical elastoplastic analysis of the macroscopic behavior is complex. This typically involves a piecewise linear failure curve including corner singularities. This paper presents a single smooth biaxial failure curve for SFRC based on a semianalytical approximation. Convexity of the proposed model is guaranteed so that numerical problems are avoided. The model has sufficient flexibility to closely match experimental results. The failure curve is also suitable for modeling plain concrete under biaxial loading. Since this model is capable of simulating the failure states in all stress regimes with a single envelope, the elastoplastic formulation is very concise and simple. The finite element implementation is developed to demonstrate the conciseness and the effectiveness of the model. The computed results display good agreement with published experimental data.",2003
Sulfur species in geological materials - sources and quantification,sulfur species testing; sulfur species distribution; thaumasite attack; sulfate attack,SULFATE; REDUCTION; MUDROCKS; SULFIDE; SHALES; FORMS; SOILS; COAL; ACID,"Groundwaters containing dissolved sulfates and sulfuric acid can lead to chemical attack on construction materials such as steel and also concrete and cement stabilized soils forming complex hydrated calcium sulfo-aluminate species such as ettringite and thaumasite. Many factors contribute to aggressive conditions that need to be adequately determined prior to construction. The identification of acid environments is generally tested for, although in some circumstances corrosion may also take place under apparently neutral or alkali conditions. Sulfur reducing bacteria can give rise to such conditions. They thrive under acidic and aerobic conditions within the range of ambient temperatures found in the UK and where there is an availability of reduced sulfur and carbon compounds. As present methods of assessment for aggressive conditions tend to concentrate on sulfate and pH determinations, the problems posed by reduced sulfide species are not fully addressed. This paper describes research by the TRL Limited and the University of Sheffield for the Highways Agency to develop better test methods for sulfur compounds in structural backfills which may cause problems to buried steel and concrete structures.

"Determining domestic formaldehyde levels in Ankara, Turkey",formaldehyde; formaldemeter 400; indoor air; homes,EXPOSURE; MOBILE; HOMES,"This cross-sectional study was carried out in October, 2001, with the aim of measuring formaldehyde levels in 399 homes representative of those in the central districts of Ankara province. Measurements were carried out with a Formaldemeter 400 in the living rooms and kitchens of these homes. The average formaldehyde levels in living rooms and kitchens were 0.064 and 0.060 ppm, respectively. The correlations between formaldehyde levels and type of house, construction materials, and method of ventilation were assessed. Formaldehyde levels were found to be significantly higher in apartments than in detached houses (living room: chi(2) = 38.7, p < 0.001; kitchen: chi(2) = 43.2, p < 0.001), significantly higher in reinforced concrete homes than in brick and mortar homes (living room: chi(2) = 43.1, p < 0.001; kitchen: chi(2) = 34.9, p < 0.001), and significantly higher in homes using mechanical methods of ventilation than in homes with natural ventilation only (chi(2) = 6.2, p < 0.05). People living in homes with formaldehyde levels higher than 0.10 ppm had a significantly higher incidence of watering eyes, dry throats, and running noses than people living in homes with lower levels. The correlation between kitchen formaldehyde levels and the type of fuel used in the kitchen was assessed, and homes using natural gas in the kitchen (53.4%) were determined to have significantly higher levels than homes using bottled propane (46.6%) (chi(2) = 48.8, p < 0.001). The results of the study show a significant correlation between formaldehyde levels and the type of home and construction materials, and between formaldehyde levels and residents' complaints of watering eyes, dry throats, and running noses.

Performance and properties of structural concrete made with recycled concrete aggregate,aggregate; alkali-aggregate reaction; chloride; concrete; corrosion resistance; durability; high strength,,"Previous investigations on recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) have largely been limited to the manufacture of nonstructural-grade concrete of up to 32 MPa-strength grade, due to undesirable physical properties of RCA-for example, high water absorption leading to high water demand of concrete. The restriction seriously limits its market and consequently diminishes the use of RCA as a construction material. The use of RCA in higher-strength (50 MPa) structural concrete has beneficial environmental consequences by further conserving rock resources currently used to produce concrete aggregate. This study attempts to improve the surf we properties of RCA and report on the influence of the improved RCA on the strength development and durability properties of 50 MPa-strength grade concrete. In addition to strength development, drying shrinkage, alkali-aggregate reaction (AAR), sulfate resistance, and chloride permeability were also investigated. The results are encouraging and show that RCA can be used to produce 50 MPa structural concrete with durability properties similar to those of concrete made with virgin aggregate.",2003
"Conditions in lairages at abattoirs for ruminants in Southwest England and in vitro survival of Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella kedougou, and Campylobacter jejuni on lairage-related substrates",,BEEF CARCASSES; IMMUNOMAGNETIC SEPARATION; MICROBIAL-CONTAMINATION; RESTING BEHAVIOR; CATTLE HIDES; MEAT HYGIENE; SLAUGHTER; SHEEP; FECES; INFECTIONS,"Information on lairages (regarding design, construction materials, and use of bedding and cleaning regimes) was collected for 21 commercial cattle and/or sheep abattoirs in southwest England. Overall, roughened or grooved concrete was the most common lairage flooring material. Straw bedding was used in the majority of lairages and was changed between animal batches, daily, weekly, and monthly in roughly 5, 60, 15, and 10%, respectively, of the surveyed lairages. Lairages were commonly washed with cold water with no detergents and/or disinfectants, and only about half the lairages were washed daily. Also, a three-pathogen cocktail inoculum comprising Escherichia coli O157 (NCTC 12900), Salmonella Kedougou (VLA S488/01), and Campylobacter jejuni (VLA C4) (at 8, 8, and 7 log CFU/ml or 8, 8, and 7 log CFU/g, respectively) was suspended in either broth (for nonfecal contamination) or bovine feces (for fecal contamination). Samples of the four most common substrates present in lairages (concrete, straw, metal, and hide) were contaminated in vitro with either fecal or nonfecal inocula and subsequently held in the laboratory at 10 or 25degreesC for I week. Bacterial counts for these samples were monitored daily and used to assess the number of days required for a 90% reduction of each pathogen population. In most cases, pathogens survived for > I week, with survival rates being higher for straw or hide than for concrete or metal and higher for fecal contamination than for nonfecal contamination. Overall, if survival rates for the three pathogens under practical lairage conditions were similar to the in vitro survival rates found in this study, contamination of lairages with pathogens could be carried over from one batch of animals to another and/or from one day to the next.",2003
"Microfouling studies on experimental test blocks of steel-making slag and concrete exposed to seawater off Chiba, Japan",microfouling community; microalgae; biofilm; concrete; slag; diatoms; seawall; construction material,MARINE INVERTEBRATE LARVAE; SETTLEMENT; SURFACE; DIATOM,"Microfouling studies with the emphasis on microalgae (Bacillariophyceae) were carried out on test blocks of steel-making slag in comparison with concrete. Two types of slag test blocks, with and without fly-ash as an additional source of silica, and concrete test blocks of size 75 x 26 x 26 mm were used to study microfouling build-up for a period of 30 d, with intermittent samplings after 1, 2, 3, 7,14 and 21 d. The species composition, cell density, biomass and surface pH of the test pieces were determined, in addition to the hydrographic parameters of the water column. Microfouling studies showed higher numbers of algal species as well as a greater cell density on the slag than on the concrete blocks. This was true with respect to biomass measured as dry weight also. Colonization was significantly delayed in the case of concrete. Navicula spp. and Nitzschia spp. were the initial colonizers on all three types of substrata and were the dominant genera throughout the study period. While the number of species increased, several disappeared after colonization, as a part of community build-up. The surface pH of the slag blocks was near neutral, whilst that of the concrete was highly alkaline during the initial period of exposure. This alkaline surface reduced the rate of species colonization on the concrete blocks initially. The study showed severe biofouling on the slag blocks compared to concrete and thus they were considered an environmentally benign construction material for land protection. The use of slag as the construction material for land protection would greatly reduce the expense compared to concrete.",2003
Functional distress modelling in Portland cement concrete pavements,concrete pavements; distress models; pavement performance; pavement management systems,,"Concrete is widely used as a construction material in pavements by public and private agencies that administer highway networks because of its high durability and capacity to resist large traffic loads and very rigorous climates. Nevertheless, these agencies have to estimate the evolution of pavement performance to plan and optimize the application of adequate maintenance activities, allowing the pavement to be maintained at an optimum service level throughout its lifetime. Predictive distress models of the incremental type, that is, models capable of predicting annual increments of different distress indicators in the pavement, could be very useful tools in the implementation of maintenance plans, with minimal need for previous data, especially with regard to information on cumulative traffic loads. This paper offers incremental models for distress prediction in jointed plain concrete pavements, related to joint problems such as faulting and spalling, which clearly affect the pavement ride quality. The equations obtained allow for not only the calculation of distress predictions in analyzing road maintenance policies, but also the adjustment of the original designs of these pavements, to minimize the occurrence and magnitude of distress problems.",2003
Simplified calculation of maximum allowable contaminant concentration in waste-amended construction materials,contaminants; heavy metals; waste utilization; PCS; leachability,EXPOSURE MODELS; GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION; FATE; TRANSPORT; FLOW,"A rational approach is often sought for relating the maximum permissible fractional replacement of traditional materials with construction-quality waste materials in constructed facilities. The development of such an approach hinges on the ability to back-calculate contaminant release rates that correspond to risk-based concentration limits in soil, groundwater or surface-water around the targeted facility. For constructed facilities in which the transport pathway is in the subsurface, the critical release mechanism for the targeted contaminant is leaching. In this paper, a simplified methodology for establishing the maximum allowable contaminant concentration in a waste material-amended concrete is developed. Contaminant leachability equations are coupled with contaminant transport factors and groundwater quality standards. Using the example of a generic contaminant contained in petroleum-contaminated soil (PCS) concrete, a methodology for back calculation of the maximum allowable concentration of the contaminant in the concrete for fixed compliance limits in a proximal well is presented.

The development of a new testing protocol for sulphur compounds in structural backfills,backfill; highways; laboratory tests; testing,,"The presence of sulphur compounds in soils and rocks can lead to chemical attack on construction materials such as steel and concrete when these materials are used as backfill to structures. Sulphate attack on concrete is a well-known phenomenon and BRE guidance to some of the causes and prevention measures has been available for some time. However, recent cases of the corrosion of corrugated steel buried structures and thaumasite attack on concrete bridge foundations have highlighted the role played by sulphides such as pyrite. The sulphides can oxidise, producing high sulphate concentrations and acid conditions, which can then attack construction materials. Present methods of assessing corrosion potential tend to concentrate on sulphate and pH, and do not fully address the problem of sulphides. This paper describes research carried out by TRL Limited and the University of Sheffield for the Highways Agency that aimed to develop better test methods for sulphur compounds in structural backfills. Advances in chemical test methods such as direct determination of sulphur by ICP-AES and novel methods of extraction have been investigated and compared with traditional methods for a range of materials with widely varying sulphur contents and mineralogy. The research led to recommendations for a revised suite of tests for sulphur compounds in structural backfills, appropriate methods of sampling and storage and limiting values for species such as reduced sulphur which are not covered by existing guidance. The research will be implemented by means of revisions to the relevant sections of the Specification for Highway Works and Design Manual for Roads and Bridges. The paper also aims to highlight the distribution of naturally occurring sulphur species within the UK geological materials. As a result of inadequate sampling, storage and assessment procedures, these sulphur species may cause problems to buried steel and concrete structures.",2003
Modifications in concrete superficial properties due to the use of different formworkrelease agents and plastic additives,cement derivates; mortar superplasticiser additives; formworks release agents; mortars surface properties; texture and colour,,"The actual research study, carried out in the Laboratory of Construction Materials of the ETSAM., analyses the modifications in superficial properties (regarding colour and texture) of grey Portland cement mortars due to the use of different formworks release agents (car oil, mineral oil and paraffin) and to the addition of plastic superplasticiser to the mixture (Bettor and Sika trademarks). Once the test samples were obtained, a digital registration was made by giving them values in terms of colour and texture observed changes using computer programmes, referring those values to the test specimen (only cement, no additives). A migration of the polymeric particles of the additives towards the surface was observed, presenting the following modifications: Colour: darker hues than those of the test specimen sample were registered in the specimens with additives. Texture: the texture of the test specimen containing additives such as modified polycarboxilic ethers, polycarboxilic ethers; modified organic polymers and modified synthetic Indamine were much smoother than the one in test specimen. Test specimens containing melamine, condensed naftalensulphate and polycarboxilic derivatives were a bit rougher but still smoother than the test specimen. The same variation of results as for the colour properties was obtained for the texture as regards to the use of formworks release agents, varying from smoothest to roughest with the car oil.",2003

Nine possible applications were identified and grouped into four main categories: construction materials (cement, concrete, ceramics, glass and glass-ceramics); geotechnical applications (road pavement, embankments); ""agriculture"" (soil amendment); and, miscellaneous (sorbent, sludge conditioning). Each application is analysed in detail, including final-product technical characteristics, with a special emphasis on environmental impacts. A comparative analysis of the different options is performed, stressing the advantages but also the weaknesses of each option. This information is systemized in order to provide a framework for the selection of best technology and final products. The results presented here show new possibilities for this waste reuse in a short-term, in a wide range of fields, resulting in great advantages in waste minimization as well as resources conservation.

Effect of blast furnace slag addition on microstructure and properties of metakaolinite geopolymeric materials,,,"Cementitious materials based on Portland cement are the most common materials used in the construction industry. However with increasing energy costs, and environmental and social problems associated with CO2 emission (greenhouse gas) in the manufacturing of Portland cement, as well as the poor durability of current cement products compared with Ancient materials, an alternative construction material is needed. The increasing acceptance and commercialisation success of geopolymer technology in niche applications in the US and abroad, means that geopolymeric materials could ultimately be used as alternate cost-effective construction materials for the manufacture of precast products such as large-diameter pipes and roofing tiles for instance. Although most applications for geopolymers at present are in the construction industry, it should be noted. that these low temperature ceramic materials also exhibit exceptional thermal stability and fire resistance. The current work postulates that calcium is the key component that distinguishes the chemistry of geopolymerization from that of alkali-activated cements and ordinary Portland Cement. Granulated blast furnace slag is used as the calcium source and the effect of its addition on the microstructure and mechanical properties of a metakaolinite-based geopolymer is investigated. It has been found that the formation of an amorphous calcium-silicate-hydrate (CSH) gel in a geopolymer system is dependent upon the initial alkali concentration. Moreover, it has been established that the coexistence of both CSH and geopolymer phases within the single system enhances the mechanical properties of the resultant binder. This binder is suggested to be the modern version of ancient concrete, whereby the formation of CSH gel within a geopolymeric binder acts as a micro-aggregate, such that the resultant binder is homogeneous and dense, resulting in increased mechanical strength.",2003
Development of a marine subtidal epibiotic community in hong kong: Implications for deployment of artificial reefs,epibiotic community; recruitment; succession; biomass; artificial reef,,"A 2-year study was conducted in Hong Kong to examine the effects of substratum, season and length of submersion on the development of a subtidal epibiotic community using four types of settlement panels (concrete, steel, wood and tyre). The season and length of submersion had a strong influence on the total biomass and on community structure while the type of substratum had very little impact on the total biomass or the structure of the epibiotic community. The season of submersion determined the species composition of the newly submerged surfaces. In the spring and summer, tubeworms were the most abundant. In the autumn and winter, barnacles and tunicates dominated. Community succession was not obvious in the first year of submersion as it was intermingled with strong seasonal settlement, growth and death of barnacles and tunicates. In the second year of submersion, green mussels and tunicates settled and grew to occupy most of the panel surfaces, forming an assemblage that was characteristic of climax communities in the local subtidal waters. The results suggest that the type of construction material has limited impact on the development of epibiotic communities on artificial reefs deployed in Hong Kong; the season of submersion may affect community structure in the early successional stage, but not the characteristics of the climax communities. This study indicates that the type of substratum should not be of concern when deploying artificial reefs in the subtidal waters in this region. The design of artificial reefs should focus more on other physical and economical aspects such as durability, flow dynamics, stability, cost, and effects on the ambient environment.",2003
Louisiana experience with foamed recycled asphalt pavement base materials,,,"Utilization of existing recyclable materials has always been key to more efficient and economical highway construction. Use of the foamed-asphalt (FA) technique to stabilize recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) is one strategy for an efficient use of salvaged construction materials. The main objective of this study is to investigate the potential-use of FA-treated RAP as a base course material in lieu of a crushed-limestone base beneath a concrete pavement layer. Test sections were constructed at US-190 near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and used for field evaluation of the FA RAP base. The laboratory mixture design of the FA RAP, the construction of the experimental base section, and the field evaluation of the stiffness of the FA RAP base layers using different in situ testing devices are presented. Preliminary results of both laboratory and field tests showed that the FA-treated RAP mixtures are very promising and can be used as an alternative to the traditional limestone base beneath a concrete pavement layer.",2003
"Building damage in Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, 1994",Rabaul; building damage; tephra fall; damage index; tephra load; roof loads; volcano; building code,ERUPTION,"Damage information on 173 buildings was collected in the immediate aftermath of the September 1994 eruption which destroyed large sections of Rabaul town, Papua New Guinea. The extent of damage is presented on a five-point scale and related to construction characteristics and tephra load. Total roof loads in Rabaul town ranged from 2 to 16 kN m(-2) (about 100- to 950-mm tephra thickness). Most buildings which collapsed completely experienced loads >7.5 kN m(-2), but many buildings sustained half this load with little more than cosmetic damage. Timber-framed buildings suffered more than buildings with at least some concrete block walls. However, some old, steel-framed buildings experienced severe damage with tephra loads as low as 2 kN m(-2). Comparisons with tephra loads and building damage elsewhere are limited but suggest that Rabaul buildings experiencing roof loads of 2-5 kN m(-2) generally survived reasonably well. However, the comparisons are unsatisfactory because of inadequate data on tephra unit weights, roof design, building ages, the quality of workmanship, and the natural variability of construction materials, particularly timber. The Rabaul data suggest that concrete block walls increase building resistance to tephra loads but it is doubtful that conventional residential buildings can be designed to sustain tephra loads exceeding 7 kN m(-2). The Rabaul experience also indicates that building codes for volcanic areas need to consider mudfills and post-eruption corrosion of sheet metal roofs and wall cladding. Most importantly, had the majority of buildings in Rabaul survived the September 1994 tephra falls, wet season mudflows a few months later would still have made most of the town unsafe and uninhabitable.",2003
Experimental investigation of pultruded FRP section combined with concrete slab,,,"The use of Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) Composites is one of the latest significant developments in the field of bridge construction. FRP composites have been the material of choice in the aerospace industry since 1960s. However, only recently glass FRP composites have been gaining both popularity and acceptance as one of the structural materials of choice because of their high strength and stiffness to weight ratio, and corrosion resistance. This paper demonstrates the possibility of combining composite materials with a low-cost construction material (i.e. concrete) resulting in a new concept of designing lightweight, corrosion immune, yet inexpensive beams having acceptable structural properties. Pultruded FRP beam section-to-concrete slab is proposed to behave under bending as a composite beam. The objectives of the proposed research are to investigate the composite behaviour of FRP members with reinforced concrete slabs and comparing the behaviour of fully encased FRP beams with that of FRP beams mechanically anchored to the concrete. An experimental program was conducted to demonstrate the behaviour of the pultruded FRP beam-to-concrete slab in composite action. Three large scale specimens of 2.25 m length were tested under four-point loading. The first specimen is a pultruded FRP beam used as a control beam. The second specimen consists of pultruded FRP beam-to-concrete slab acting as a composite beam. The third specimen is a fully concrete encased FRP beam. The test results indicated the feasibility of using hybrid FRP-concrete beam to increase the load carrying capacity in flexure as well as beam stiffness. The outcome of this research provides substantial information for both designers and researchers in the field of FRP composites.",2003
Effect of environmental conditions on Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC),,TOBERMORITE FORMATION,"Autoclaved Aerated Concrete (AAC) has become widely used as a construction material all over the world. The construction system technique using AAC has many advantages over the conventional systems in addition to the good quality and aesthetic appearance of the building. Some of the advantages are the rapid on-site assembly, accuracy of dimensions, ease of transportation, good insulation properties and the possibility of cutting the blocks with just a hand saw. The main diadvantage is that the durability of this material, which is new in both the U.S.A. and the Gulf region, is still under investigation. In this study, the durability of AAC is being investigated under different environmental conditions such as exposure to seawater and high temperatures. The combined effects of seawater and temperature on the compressive strength and fracture toughness of Autoclaved Aerated Concrete were studied for time durations up to 90 days. The compressive strength tests were carried out on cubes of dimensions 100 x 100 x 100 mm. For all beams, the cross-sectional dimensions were 150 x 250 mm and the length was 625 mm. Beams for the fracture tests were carried out under four point bending with a clear span of 450 mm. For the fracture toughness tests, the beams were prenotched with a through crack 2 mm wide and 50 mm long. The experimental results show that the environmental conditions have a big effect on the behavior of AAC. Both the compressive strength and the fracture toughness greatly decrease with the increase in temperature as well as the time duration for being submerged under the sea water.",2003
Holistic approach to durable high performance concrete,,STEEL,"Steel reinforced concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials due to its excellent durability and composite performance. However, performance can be significantly reduced in marine and deicing salt environments. Calcium nitrite corrosion inhibitor substantially improves resistance to chloride-induced corrosion, and is widely used throughout the world. Life cycle modeling shows that calcium nitrite is cost effective in concretes with reduced permeability, including high performance concretes. New advancements in concrete technology have further enhanced the benefits of using calcium nitrite, These include the use of shrinkage reducing admixtures and non-metallic fibers for structural reinforcement to reduce both the tendency of concrete to crack and to mitigate crack openings if it does. In this paper we present long-term data showing that calcium nitrite improves the corrosion performance of high performance concretes. Furthermore, we show that combinations of calcium nitrite and shrinkage reducing admixtures have improved corrosion resistance coupled to a significant reduction in shrinkage, which is a major cause of cracking in high performance concretes. Combinations of high performance concrete with calcium nitrite and shrinkage reducing admixtures with the use of newly developed structural synthetic fibers result in durable concrete with enhanced flexural performance.",2003
Effect of sustained tensile stress and temperature on GFRP composite bars properties: 1. Preliminary experiment in deionised water and alkaline solution,composite; alkali; glass fibers; corrosion; bars; concrete structures; water; absorption; accelerated ageing; sustained load; tensile strength; SEM,DIFFUSION,"Fibre Reinforced Polymer (FRP) composites represent an alternative construction material to overcome the corrosion problems caused by traditional steel reinforcement. This paper describes a new experimental set-up specially designed to perform accelerated ageing tests on FRP reinforcements. The setup uses a combination of temperature, which can reach up to 80degreesC, environmental exposure (alkaline, saline, water, and concrete) and sustained loading. Preliminary experimental observations show good performance of GFRP rebars under the combined effects of sustained stress corresponding to 30-40% of the ultimate tensile strength, temperature ranging from 55 to 75degreesC and in two environmental exposures: deionised water and alkaline solution. Microstructural analyses, using several techniques (Thermogravimetric Analysis, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Scanning Electronic Microscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared), have been conducted on rebars conditioned in an alkaline solution over 60 days and show that only the internal part of the rebars has not been affected by degradation.",2003
Development and applications of various polymer concrete engineering materials,electrically conductive polymer concrete; insulating polymer concrete; precast polymer concrete,,"A wide variety of advanced construction materials have been developed to meet certain needs and solve specific problems.

Analysis of blast damage to green concrete: A dynamic testing approach to field cured specimens,,SHOCK,"Concrete is a common construction material used throughout the world, and with increasing demand of fast-track construction, blasting and concrete casting are occurring simultaneously at many sites where rock is being excavated for concrete placement. However, there has been significant disagreement in the construction industry as to what intensity of shock vibrations green, or fresh concrete can tolerate. Peak particle velocities are often arbitrarily chosen, or are simply based on materials such as plaster and drywall that have been more thoroughly studied in relation to damage. Previous research on green concrete has used the concrete's static strength subjected to shockwaves at different ages as the primary damage criteria. In addition, the static strength tests have been based on curing time. However, changes in temperature or humidity can dramatically alter the hydration rate, which affects strength development of different cements. To account for temperature changes and humidity the concept of concrete maturity is commonly used and allows the researcher to see where the concrete was in terms of hydration progress. In general, static testing determines the failure stress that the concrete's macrostructure can handle, and often failure occurs. in the natural materials first or along large defects in casting techniques. Dynamic testing or high strain rate testing, on the other hand, loads materials at such a high rate that larger defects do not have time to react and instead the microstructure is more highly stressed leading to higher strength and stiffness values. This is known as the material's strain rate sensitivity. Since dynamic testing better tests the microstructural strength, it is believed that it may provide a better way to assess damage to green concrete. Testing includes both static and dynamic compression as well as static and dynamic splitting tensile strength to assess whether damaged has occurred to the concrete. No significant statistical evidence was discovered that damage to the concrete occurred at five'different ""green"" maturities from peak resultant velocities ranging from 10.66 in/s (271mm/s) to 4.40 in/s (112 mm/s) with average intensity of 6.7 in/s (170mm/s).",2003
Early behaviour of shot-sfrc as initial lining,,,"Though shotcrete as an initial lining of a tunnel is a more reliable and economic measure, there is no further consideration on early-age behaviour of shooting steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC).

A group of tests on several kinds of steel fibers, which. manufactured in local company, had been conducted with the ASTM C 10 18 on its strength and toughness. Numerical analysis stressed on time-dependent behaviour of shot-SFRC as first lining for its properties evaluation with age. Practical application focuses on rock conditions and bracing way before shotcreting. Comparisons with in-situ stress and displacement measurements are given.",2003
Design concept of trapezoid-shaped CSG dam,,,"CSG, Cemented Sand and Gravel, is a material made by adding cement and water to rock-like material such as riverbed gravel or excavation muck that can be obtained easily near dam sites, and mixing it briefly with simple device. The strength of CSG is relatively not strong and the fluctuation of its physical property is large compared with concrete. On the other hand, because the stress occurred in a trapezoid-shaped dam with gentle slope is small, the required strength of its material can be low. It is, therefore, possible to use the CSG as a construction material for the trapezoid-shaped dam. Authors have advocated the trapezoid-shaped CSG Dam as the new type of dam that combines both characteristics of a trapezoid-shaped dam and CSG. The trapezoid-shaped CSG dam achieves three rationalizations at the same time: the rationalization of design, of execution, and of materials. In this paper, basic characteristic of a trapezoid-shaped dam is clarified by stress analyses using a dynamic Finite Element Method (FEM). And Considering the results of stress analyses, the basic design concept of a trapezoid-shaped CSG dam is described.",2003
Concept of CSG and its material properties,,,"CSG, Cemented Sand and Gravel, is a material made by adding cement and water to rock-like material such as riverbed gravel or excavation muck that can be obtained easily near dam sites, and mixing it briefly with simple device. The strength of CSG is relatively not strong and the fluctuation of its physical property is large compared with concrete.

It is, therefore, possible to use the CSG as a construction material for the trapezoid shaped dam. Authors have advocated the Trapezoid-Shaped CSG Dam as a new type of dam that combines both characteristics of a trapezoid shaped dam and CSG. In this paper, basic properties of CSG, such as compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, tensile strength, stress-strain curve that obtained by laboratory tests were described. Because a grading and the water content of raw material are varied through a construction, physical properties of CSG are inevitably scattered. Therefore, it is important to grasp the relationship between a strength of CSG and mix proportion such as grading, water content and cement content and so on. Generally, CSG shows the elastro-plasticity behavior, only the elastic range of CSG is considered in a design. Therefore, ""Elastic range strength"" that defined as the maximum strength in the elastic range was also obtained in the tests. Furthermore, the elastro-plasticity of CSG was confirmed by cyclic loading tests. As the results show that proper-ties of CSG is largely affected in properties of its raw material. Therefore, it is important to examine the properties of CSG using practical raw material before designing a trapezoidal-shaped CSG Dam.",2003
Mix design of Roller Compacted Concrete for Ghatghar pumped storage scheme in India,,,"Mass work of Civil structures like dams require large quantity of concrete. Incorporation of pozzolana in concrete effect economy in cement consumption without affecting the properties of concrete. Considering the economy and fast speed of construction, worldwide development took place in utilising flyash in concrete with the advent of new construction material called as Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC). It is a concrete with no consistency (zero slump) with large replacement of cement by flyash, spread by dozers and compaction being carried out by vibratory rollers. Pozzolanic properties of flyash mainly attribute to the active Silica and Alumina content which readily react with free time of cement to form additional compound of cementing property. Besides, its fineness helps in increasing plasticity and workability with reduced water-cement ratio, which results in increase in unit weight with higher strength development and water tightness. For the first time in India, construction of two storage dams in RCC - namely Upper Dam and Lower Dam under Ghatghar Pumped Storage Scheme are being undertaken by Irrigation Department, Government of Maharashtra, contemplating generation of 250 MW Hydro Power. Mix designs were conducted considering 40% to 70% cement replacement by flyash and having 180, 200, 220, 240 kg/m(3) cementitious contents. Final mix design evolved contains 60% cement replacement by flyash from Eklahare Thermal Power Plant, Nashik for 220 kg/m(3) cementitious content (40% cement + 60% flyash) and for 0.523 water/cement ratio, gaining i) 150 kg/cm(2) compressive strength at 91 days, ii) Density more than 2500 kg/m(3), iii) Desired impermeability, iv) Modulus of Elasticity comparable to conventional concrete.",2003
Smart FRP-OFGB bars and their application in reinforced concrete beams,,SENSORS,"Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) has become more and more popular as construction material in civil engineering due to its advantages of corrosion-resistance, high strength, nonmagnetic, fatigue-resistance and so on. Optical Fiber Bragg Grating (OFBG) is now widely accepted as smart sensor due to its advantages of electric-magnetic resistance, small size, distributing measurement, durability, and so on. Combined the strength properties of FRP with the sensing properties of OFBG, a new kind of smart FRP-OFBG composite bars have been developed, and their mechanical properties, microstructures and sensing properties are also studied. The experiment of FRP-OFBG reinforced concrete beams under static load has been done, and the strain of FRP bars and cracking of concrete are monitored, especially the slip between FRP bars and concrete, and the strain distribution of the beams. The experimental results show that FRP-OFBG is a wonderful construction material for civil engineering. As smart sensing element, FRP-OFBG bars have overcome the difficulties of embedment installation in concrete structures, and can be conveniently used in reinforced concrete structures as sensors as well as reinforcing bars.",2003
Fiber optic sensing of PC girder strengthened with prestressed PBO fiber sheets,,BRILLOUIN-SCATTERING; SENSOR,"With the deterioration of construction materials, damage occurrence and the change of the load level for bridge structures, some existing reinforced concrete and prestressed concrete bridges need to be strengthened. FRP (Fiber Reinforcement Polymer) has been accepted as an innovative material for renovation and strengthening of existing infrastructures. Among the FRP materials, the PBO (Poly-p-phenylene) fiber sheets attracted great attention because of the high strength, Young's Modulus and energy absorption capability. The research and application of PBO fiber sheet on structural strengthening have being carried out in recent years. In this study, the newly developed P-PUT (PBO Prestressing Upgrading Technique) method with PBO fiber sheets is described briefly and used to update a full-scale PC girder. In order to evaluate the strengthening effects and short-term and long-term performance of the strengthened PC girder by a newly developed technology, structural health monitoring technologies for large-scale civil structures are necessary. On the other hand, fiber optic sensing technology has been treated as an innovative monitoring strategy for civil structures. As a distributed fiber optic sensing technique, BOTDR (Brillouin Optical Time Domain Deflectometry) is being considered as a promising method for structural health monitoring, damage assessment and performance evaluation. A strain/loss analyzer based on the BOTDR technique has been developed for the evaluation and assessment of the performance of the PC girder with prestressed PBO fiber sheets by P-PUT method, such as the measurement of compression and tensional strain of concrete, strain of PBO sheets under different load conditions. From the strain measurement results of PBO sheets and concrete, it was found that the mounting method of the anchorage was efficient and debonding did not occur. Two types of bounding methods for optic fiber installation called as Point Fixation (PF) Bonding method and Overall Bonding (OB) method were discussed.",2003
Helically reinforced high strength concrete beams,,,"Current developments of the construction industry have led to the continuous improvement of construction materials. However, continuous improvements in a material's strength capacity are often burdened by a decrease in ductility. To increase the ductility will allow new materials to be used, as well as harness the full potential flexural strength of reinforced concrete beams. Improved ductility through the incorporation of helical reinforcement located in the compression region is investigated herein. The helix must successfully confine the inner core in order for substantial ductility improvements to occur. In this study, different helical configurations are investigated, in order to determine the full implications of their use. This paper considers the strength gain and ductility of high strength reinforced concrete beams incorporating high strength tensile and helical reinforcement. The effect on ductility through the application of helical reinforcement located in the compressive region of the beam is highlighted. Beams of span four meters were subjected to flexural loading, with an emphasis placed on the mid span deflection. The results indicate that helical reinforcement is an effective way of increasing ductility in high strength reinforced concrete beams.",2003
Self-compacting concrete - hardened material properties and structural behaviour,,,"Self-compacting concrete (SCC) is an innovative construction material with a favourable rheological behaviour, which is caused in the modified concrete composition. Based on this fact SCC offers improved properties and therefore many advantages regarding the productivity and the design potential compared with normal vibrated concrete. Consequently, the amount of SCC, used for structural purposes has strongly increased. In this context it has to be clarified, if it is possible to apply the current design rules, e.g. Model Code 90 and Eurocode 2, based on years of experience on normal vibrated concrete, to structural members made of SCC as well. This paper represents the analysis of own and internationally published test results of the compressive strength, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, bond behaviour as well as the time-dependent deformations of SCC in comparison with conventional concrete, in order to give a general statement regarding the agreements and differences between the hardened material properties of these concretes.",2003
Thermal infrared inspection of FRP bridge decks for health monitoring,thermal infrared (TIR); nondestructive evaluation (NDE); glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites,,"Even in the best of economic times, funding for infrastructure maintenance, repair and rehabilitation is never adequate. As infrastructure in the United States continues to age, the funding deficit to simply maintain the existing bridges will continue to soar. Due to the inadequacy of capital allocated for infrastructure repair and rehabilitation, new, more durable construction materials with potentially longer service lives are being explored as a means of narrowing the financial deficit. One such material is fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites (FRP). By replacing conventional bridge component structural materials (i.e.; reinforced concrete and steel) with FRP, which has a higher strength to weight ratio, bridges can achieve a significant reduction in dead load weight. Bridges that have experienced substructure and superstructure deterioration can undergo a superstructure replacement with FRP rather than be subjected to the traditional load posting (vehicular load restrictions). Through reducing the bridge dead load without compromising bridge strength, original design live loads can be maintained. That is, the structural stability of the bridge is retained while functional obsolescence of the bridge is averted. In order for these new bridge superstructure components to be readily accepted as viable construction materials, quick and effective means of monitoring them for degradation and overall structural health must be established and standardized. One of the most promising methods of achieving this is through the use of thermal infrared (TIR). A slight increase in temperature above ambient will allow for adequate inspection of large sections of bridge decking for detection of debonded areas between FRP components. This paper will illustrate the successes and challenges of using TIR for this purpose, both in the laboratory and in field investigations. Additionally, areas for future work and improvements will be suggested.",2003
Manufacturing artificial aggregates from industrial sludge and marine clay with addition of sodium salt,construction aggregates; disposal; industrial sludge; marine clay; sodium salt,CONCRETE; ASH,"The potential of converting industrial sludge and dredged marine clay into building and construction materials as an alternative to disposal was investigated in this study. The industrial sludge was mixed with marine clay at various compositions and was shaped into round pellets to be used as concrete aggregates. The pellets were then dried and transferred into a high temperature kiln where they were heated at 1, 135degreesC. The artificial aggregates were more porous then the normal granite aggregate. The occurrence of this condition was suspected to be attributed to two factors, viz. the firing temperature and the amount of sodium in the aggregates. To validate this hypothesis, the aggregates with and without added sodium chloride were fired at temperatures of 1, 100 and 1,200degreesC. Results showed a reduction in the densities of the aggregates with the addition of sodium chloride and the increase in firing temperature.",2003
Environmental impact assessment of a scrap tyre artificial reef,artificial reef; colonization; environmental impact; leaching; tyre,COLONIZATION,"Scrap tyres have been widely used around the world to construct artificial reefs. They are a popular construction material, being readily available at no cost, durable, and with large void spaces. However, published information about the environmental impact of tyres in the marine environment is limited. When used, successful colonization by epibiota and mobile species seems to be taken as empirical proof of their suitability. In 1998, an experimental scrap tyre artificial reef was constructed in Poole Bay to provide data on the environmental impact of the material. Epibiotic colonization is being monitored for comparison with that on concrete control modules deployed at the same time. Samples of the epibiota have been analysed for heavy metals and organic compounds. Results from the first year of deployment are presented.

The physical and chemical performance of artificial reef blocks made using quarry by-products,artificial reefs; construction materials; environmental compatibility; leaching; metal flux; impacts; performance,PLASMA-MASS SPECTROMETRY; FLY-ASH; HEAVY-METALS; MARINE-SEDIMENTS; COAL-ASH; SEAWATER,"The cost of construction materials is a major factor determining the economic viability of artificial reefs. The use of by-products is one method of reducing costs, but often, to comply with licensing conditions, chemical and physical stability have to be demonstrated before such materials may be employed. Granite quarrying produces a range of low-value by-products, including an aqueous granite powder suspension. When mixed with other by-products and consolidated using 5% (w/w) cement and 5% (w/w) coal fly-ash, this substance was used to produce concrete blocks with a compressive strength of approximately 14 N mm(-2) after a standard 90-day curing period. The blocks exceeded the strength requirement of commercial building blocks (British Standard 6073) by five times, were cheaper to produce compared with standard construction-grade blocks, and permitted a range of design options to be considered through the inclusion of voids. The chemical stability of the proposed concrete and base granite material was tested, under conditions designed to maximize metal flux, and showed significant but very low leaching of iron, strontium, barium, rubidium, manganese, and uranium. Metal leaching was not necessarily in proportion to the metal concentration in the base material. Quarry by-products can be used in the manufacture of blocks that are physically robust and environmentally safe with a concomitant reduction in production costs.

Engineered FRP bridge decks - Solutions for the future,,,"The concept of ""composite"" building construction has existed since ancient times, The concept of composites is a relatively new technology as applied to the bridge market. While the majority of the historical and durability data of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) composite installations come from the aerospace, marine and corrosion resistance industries, FRP composites have been used as a construction material for several decades. FRP composite products were first demonstrated to reinforce concrete structures in the mid 1950's. FRP reinforcing bars in concrete were used when special performance requirements were identified such as non-magnetic properties or in areas that were subjected to severe chemical attack. During the late 1970's and early, 1980's, many applications of composite reinforcing products were demonstrated in Europe and Asia. In 1986, the world's first highway bridge using composites reinforcing tendons was built in Germany(1). The first all-composites bridge deck was demonstrated in China. The first all-composites pedestrian bridge was installed in 1992 in Aberfeldy, Scotland(2). In the US, the first FRP reinforced concrete bridge deck was built in 1996 at McKinleyville, WV (Figure 1) followed by the first all-composite vehicular bridge deck in Russell, KS. Numerous composite pedestrian bridges have been installed in US, state and national parks in remote locations not accessible by heavy construction equipment. or for spanning over roadways and railways. For the 1990's and beyond, composite fabricators and material suppliers actively, developed products for the civil infrastructure, considered to be the largest potential market for FRP composites. Vehicular bridge decks became the most attractive product because of its visibility to the public and importance to reducing the number of deficient or functionally obsolete bridges of today.",2002
Experimental investigation of the strain rate dependent impact behaviour of cementitious composites,,CONCRETE; COMPRESSION; TESTS,"As for most construction materials, cementitious composites exhibit a strain rate dependent mechanical behaviour The frequent occurrence of impact loads during the lifetime of civil engineering constructions makes the experimental research into the impact properties of construction materials sensible. To this purpose split Hopkinson bar tests are Often used. However due to the specific behaviour of plain cementitious materials-low strains and softening-special attention has to be paid to some aspects of the experimental setup, the treatment of the recorded signals and the interpretation of the final results. Some results of impact tensile tests on microconcrete are presented. These results show that the strength, the strain at maximum stress, the ultimate deformation and the energy absorbing capacity are higher than in static test conditions.",2002
Durability test results of construction and process materials exposed to liquid and gas phase ozone,ozone; construction materials; durability; ozone resistance; concrete; plastics; Elastomers; joint sealants; coatings; metals; adhesives,,"The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California performed a study to evaluate materials of construction for use in ozone contactor construction. The concept reactor is a baffled box conduit constructed of concrete with metallic valves, slide gates, etc. for flow control and metallic piping for ozone gas distribution and off-gas collection. The study concluded that ozone by itself has no impact on standard type 2/type 5 concrete and that pozzalonic admixtures could enhance the structural design. Metals exposed to ozone should be constrained to the austenitic grades of stainless steel. Plastics should be limited in their application, elastomers should be limited to Viton-A and EPDM, and none of the elastomers, protective coatings, structural adhesives or joint sealants tested show promise in long term performance.",2002
"Characterisation and treatment of roads covered with zinc ashes, muffle furnace fragments and lead slags from former non-ferrous metal industries in Belgium",ash roads; waste; non-ferrous industry; metal leaching; secondary construction material; reuse; wmr 511-3,,"Zinc ashes, muffle furnace fragments and lead slags from non-ferrous industries were applied to pave roads in the North of Belgium. From an inventory it appeared that there are at least 490 km of such roads. In our survey the materials on these roads were characterised. The total metal concentration, the availability and the leaching as a function of time were determined. It appeared that these materials contain high concentrations of heavy metals, some of which are readily available. The high leaching of some metals makes them as such unsuitable as secondary construction material. Methods for the application of these materials for road construction were examined where the materials replaced part of the sand and gravel fraction in lean concrete and in bituminous mixtures, or where they replaced the sand in sand-cement mixtures, all these to be used for road foundations, cycle tracks, etc. When lead slags were applied in lean concrete, a material was obtained complying with the standards for secondary construction materials and with sufficient compressive strength for road foundations. When zinc ashes or muffle fragments were used to replace sand in sand-cement mixtures, again a suitable construction material was obtained. The other combinations tried out were rather unsuccessful, because of high metal leaching and/or poor compressive strength.",2002

This paper describes a numerical method for obtaining key fracture parameters describing the softening behavior of quasibrittle materials in mode I failure. The identification problem is formulated as a special type of constrained optimization problem known in the mathematical programming literature as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints. Experimental results of a wedge splitting test recently conducted at the Laboratory of Construction Materials, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (LMC/EPFL) are used to illustrate applicability of the proposed method.

History of hot mix asphalt mixture design in the United States,history; asphalt mixes; design; asphaltic concrete,CONCRETE,"Asphalt has been used as a construction material from the earliest days of civilization, but though it has long been used as a waterproofing material in shipbuilding and hydraulics, its use in roadway construction is much more recent. A recent survey revealed a total of over 2.3 million miles of hard-surfaced (asphalt or concrete) roads in the United States, of which approximately 96% have asphalt surfaces. Asphalt mixture consists of asphalt, coarse and fine aggregate, and a number of additives occasionally used to improve its engineering properties. The purpose of mixture design is to select an optimum asphalt content for a desired aggregate structure to meet prescribed criteria. The demands and reliance upon America's roadways for mobility and commerce have increased substantially over the past three decades. The highway network is not only the economic backbone of the country, but it also provides the only transportation access to a growing number of communities. This paper presents a review of the past, present, and future trends in asphalt mixture design as the methods have evolved in an attempt to meet the ever-increasing demands of traffic.",2002
Use of dry sludge from waste water treatment plants as an additive in prefabricated concrete bricks,dry sludge; waste water; prefabricated concrete; physical properties; mechanical properties; environmental impact; leaching,,"Dry sludge from the Sabadell Water Treatment Plant was used to prepare prefabricated concrete bricks. After characterising the sludge and the manufacturing process used to make the bricks, we define the conditions of addition of the sludges in the manufacture. Reference samples not containing sludge and samples containing 2% of dry, sludge by cement weight were prepared. The variation in density, porosity, absorption coefficient and compressive strength of the bricks with the presence of sludge was determined over time. Leaching of the bricks was determined according to the NEN 7345 standard. In most cases the addition of sludge produces a decrease in porosity and absorption coefficients and an increase in compressive strength, so one could expect these bricks to have greater durability. As regards leaching pollutants in the bricks, they are below the limit of the Dutch NEN standard for construction materials and thus can be classified as inert material.",2002
"Materials for the new millennium-synthetic inorganic, semi-inorganic, and organic-inorganic hybrid polymers",synthetic inorganic polymers; mineralogical polymers; covalent inorganic polymers; inorganic-organic polymers; organic-inorganic hybride polymerspoly(organosiloxanes); poly(organophosphazenes); poly(sulfur nitride),,"The properties of mineralogical and covalent inorganic polymers are briefly described in the introductory part. Glass is an important polymer made up of rings and chains of silicate units which contain negatively charged oxygen atoms neutralized by positive metal ions. Glass and few other mineralogical types of inorganic polymers, like aluminum oxyde, could be fabricated into fibers and used as insulating materials, and as reinforcing fibers in composite materials. Most rocks, bricks, concrete and ceramics belong to mineralogical polymers which are of great importance as construction materials, but their application is often limited because they are not flexible, elastomeric and resistant to impact. The most important covalent polymers are poly(organosiloxanes) and poly(organophosphazenes). Poly (organosiloxanes) contain chains of silicone-oxygen atoms with two methyl groups attached to silicon atoms. Silicone polymers have low glass transition temperature of -130 degreesC. Temperature of elasticity of silicone rubber is from -30 degreesC to 250 degreesC. They strongly repel water and are used as corrosion inhibitors of metals. An important field of application of silicones is in medicine and in preparation of medical devices. In continuation, there are briefly described the properties and application of poly(phosphazenes) and poly(sulfur nitride). After that, several examples of organic-inorganic hybrid polymers are listed, illustrating the variety of existing and possible new commercial applications of these new materials. The following applications of hybrid polymers are described: silane block copolymers for contact lenses, acrylate tin copolymers for marine antifoulant coatings, scratch resistant automotive coatinas and preparation of microporous silica.",2002
Effect of replacement of lateritic soils with granite fines on the compressive and tensile strengths of laterized concrete,granite fines; compressive-strength; tensile-strength; laterized concrete,,"Over the years, research works have been carried out on lateritic soils with a view to investigating their usefulness wholly as a construction material or partly as a substitute for fine aggregate component of concrete. This paper presents the results of investigations carried out on how lateritic soils replaced with varying percentages of granite fines affect the compressive and tensile strengths of laterized concrete. Laterized concrete is concrete in which the fine aggregates is lateritic soil, The results showed that for different mix proportions (1:1:2, 1:1.5:3, 1:2:4 and 13:6) maximum compressive strength values were obtained for laterized concrete containing 50% granite fines. Also the addition of granite fines in laterized concrete resulted in a decrease in tensile strength. However, the tensile strengths obtained fall within the range of values (1.44 -2.0 N/mm(2)) given for grade 30 concrete. Therefore, laterized concrete containing granite fines can be used in the construction of buildings and rural infrastructures. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",2002
Wave equation analyses of fiber-reinforced polymer composite piling,fiber-reinforced materials; polymers; wave equation; pile foundation; durability; corrosion,,"Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites represent an alternative construction material without many of the performance disadvantages of traditional materials. The use of FRP as a pile material can eliminate deterioration problems of conventional piling materials in waterfront environments and aggressive soils. The driveability of traditional piling can be predicted using wave equation analysis of piles (WEAP). The input parameters used in WEAP a-re obtained by back-analyses of actual case histories. The properties of FRP piling differ from those of conventional piling, so conventional WEAP input parameters may not work as well for FRP composite piling. In this paper, WEAP input parameters for three composite pile types are calibrated using available driving records. The driveability of FRP composite piling is also compared with that of piling made of conventional materials such its timber, steel, and concrete.",2002
Use of fiber reinforced polymer composites as reinforcing material for concrete,"fiber reinforced materials; concrete, reinforced; polymers; construction materials",,"Although the potential of continuous fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) was recognized more than 50 years ago, bottlenecks such as vulnerability to static fatigue, ultraviolet radiation, alkaline environment, etc., continued to restrict their use as a construction material. Extensive research across the world during approximately the last 25 years has led to a better understanding of properties and behavior of the FRPs under different conditions. Given their lightweight, noncorrosive, and nonmagnetic nature and their high tensile strength, FRP composites are being used as reinforcement in concrete, especially in prestressed concrete construction, anchors for slope stabilization, and use in special structures such as high-speed linear motor railway tracks, MRI units of hospitals, and repair and rehabilitation works. An attempt has been made in this paper to comprehensively put together the various aspects of FRPs, including their structural and durability characteristics, the ongoing research in the areas related to their utilization as a reinforcing material for concrete structures, and the application of FRP sheets in rehabilitation of deteriorated concrete structures. Though issues related to the manufacture of FRP composites and design procedures have not been considered in detail, they have been included for information and completeness. The paper also presents the current thinking on the design and construction procedures using FRP material in conjunction with concrete and provides a brief discussion of some of the documented applications of FRP composites-rods and sheets-as reinforcement in concrete construction. It may also be mentioned that the paper is largely based on the case studies and research work carried out in Japan; appropriate references to related work in other parts of the world are also included, though in principle there is very little difference in the approaches being adopted across the world.",2002
"Fish assemblages associated with artificial reefs of concrete aggregates or quarry stone offshore Miami Beach, Florida, USA",artificial reef; fish; Panulirus argus,COLONIZATION; RESTORATION,"Few studies have compared the suitability of different artificial reef construction materials in terms of their efficacy in acquiring diverse faunal assemblages. We compared the fishes associated with 12 co-located reefs constructed of limestone quarry boulders, concrete-gravel aggregate, or concrete-tire aggregate (four of each substrate) in 7 m of water, 200 m offshore Miami Beach, Florida, USA. All 12 reefs were deployed 100 rn apart the same day in two lines of six. The four quarry stone reefs consist of a pile of 50 boulders each. The remaining eight reefs, of concrete-gravel aggregate and concrete-tire aggregate, were each constructed with 25 1.5 m edge and 25 1.2 m edge tetrahedron modules. Every two months from October 1998 to February 2001, SCUBA divers recorded fish species, abundance, and length, as well as spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, abundance. One hundred and forty-six species of fishes were recorded during the study period. The abundance and species richness of fish on each treatment exhibited a significant (p<0.05) seasonal variation with summer months having the greatest numbers and winter the lowest. There was no significant difference in total fish or spiny lobster abundance or fish biomass amongst the three reef types (p>0.05). Likewise, multi-dimensional scaling of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indices did not indicate clustering of fish assemblages by reef type. Comparison of pre-deployment fish counts from the reef sites and neighboring hard bottom and jetty with counts from the same sites two years post-deployment indicate the artificial reefs increased both fish abundance and richness in the local area.

Trial cylinders were made in a laboratory simulation of block plant processes to evaluate admixtures and wood treatments, then promising mixes were used to make several batches of blocks in a commercial plant. Cylinders and blocks were tested for compressive strength, and the blocks were subjected to wet-dry cycling. Results indicate that weight, strength, and durability targets were met. Questions remain regarding the economic performance of the product, and further study is required to evaluate the effect of curing blocks in the uncontrolled exterior conditions typical of the block industry.",2002

Properties of lightweight aggregate for lightweight concrete production,lightweight aggregate; porosity; strength; water absorption; microstructure,,"The increasing demands for the speed of construction and the greater use of prefabrication units in the building industry have urged the need for exploring new innovative construction materials. The adoption of lightweight aggregate concrete in prefabrication of structural panels for building works can minimize the foundation load, reducing the size of structural members, speeds up the construction program and has better control on material quality. All lightweight aggregates are porous in nature that water absorption is much greater than normal weight aggregate. The great absorption rate of aggregate will lowers the water content at the aggregate/cement paste interface and affects critically the mix design, workability of fresh lightweight concrete. Since characteristic of lightweight aggregate varies with the production plants, operation and the raw material used in the production process, the surface characteristic, size and pore structure of the lightweight aggregate differs from one type to the others. Surface topography and pore distribution of the aggregate surface dominate the water absorption characteristic of the aggregate, affect critically the properties of the resulting lightweight aggregate concrete and the bonding with the cement matrix. This paper presented a detail study on the physical properties of a locally available lightweight aggregate made from expanded clay. Density and strength of the lightweight aggregate of different density ranges and their relationship with water absorption characteristic and internal microscopic were examined.",2002
Construction of fiber-reinforced plastic modular decks for highway bridges,,,"Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite materials have shown great potential as alternative bridge construction materials to conventional materials such as steel and concrete. This is especially valid in the field of repair and rehabilitation of existing bridges as well as in new bridge construction. The acceptance of composites in the highway bridge industry is mainly due to their superior properties such as high strength, durability, corrosion resistance, and fatigue resistance. Moreover, FRPs are well suited for mass production of structural shapes because of their high strength-to-weight ratios, which has resulted in the rapid installation of FRP modular decks on highway bridges. Details related to the construction of FRP modular decks as replacements on existing highway bridge superstructures are provided. In addition, details on shipping, handling, erection, assembly, deck-to-deck connections, deck-to-stringer connections, joints, and wearing surfaces are discussed.",2002
Satellite imagery for studying the UHI as an aid in urban planning,,,"The Urban Heat Island (UHI) arises from the essence of urban development i.e the substitution of natural surfaces with vegetative cover, with surfaces of asphalt, concrete and other heat absorbing materials. The thermal image of Tel Aviv-Jaffa, from LANDSAT satellites' thermal band, displays features of cooler and warmer areas, very similar in their distribution over the 11 years and over different seasons studied in this work. From many UHI studies, it is apparent that surface temperatures are influenced by: building density, construction materials, inter-building land-use ( including parking lots), vegetation, directions of main streets with relation to the dominant breeze direction, obstacles to the breeze, human activities - e.g. transportation, industry. Over 50 locations representing the hotter and cooler parts of the city were chosen to investigate this thermal pattern. With cooperation of the Tel Aviv-Jaffa Municipality's GIS unit, tree density, building density and parking lot maps were produced from the relevant data layers. Hand-held camera ground photography was also taken for most of the chosen locations around the city. The determining factor for lower surface temperatures appears to be trees. Even in more densly built areas, trees in interbuilding spaces are responsible for reduction of surface temperatures. Furthermore, in some less dense parts of the city with few inter-building trees, the surface temperatures are high. The hottest locations are in general open spaces of bare ground or asphalt covered parking lots or built areas without trees. Tel Aviv-Jaffa is hot and rainless at least 8 months of the year. Therefore, in order to improve the climatic quality of the city and to reduce the use of energy for cooling, it is recommended to a forest the city. An ongoing study for the Ministry of Housing, to be completed during the first quarter of 2002 is a studying of the UHI of 4 other cities in Israel: Beer-Sheva, Haifa, Jerusalem and Natanya - cities in different geographical regions, the objective being to provide government level decision makers with a basis for guidelines for UHI considering urban planning policy.",2002
Flax riber reinforced concrete - A natural riber biocomposite for sustainable building materials,,MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; COMPOSITES; FIBERS; TOUGHNESS,"Fibers of many types, including some natural fibers, have been used widely for architectural applications in structural and non-structural assemblies. One important use of the mechanical properties of natural fibers is tensile reinforcing and volume filler within the matrix of a composite material; cementitious, polymeric, earthen or otherwise. While natural fibers offer a widely available and inexpensive source of mechanically useful cellulose, the full extent of the potential for architectural applications has not been adequately investigated. This paper presents the laboratory results of an optimized flax fiber reinforced concrete (FFRC). The mechanical results are intended as a demonstration of the use of natural fiber reinforced concretes (NFRCs) for buildings in developing regions with access to significant sources of cellulose fibers and small-scale industrial capacity to process them. Generally, the inclusion of natural fibers within a concrete matrix is intended to augment the energy absorption of the cured concrete. Specifically, an optimal ratio mix and fiber length of flax fibers in concrete was sought in obtaining the highest possible ultimate strength, toughness and crack management from the various samples. Results from mechanical laboratory testing yielded positive conclusions regarding the increased strength and toughness of the natural fiber-reinforced concrete. While strength was shown to increase with the inclusion of particular fiber lengths and decrease with others, results from the optimized formulation indicated the potential to substantially increase the flexural toughness of the concrete composite. A theoretical analysis confirmed the empirical results of an optimum length of 3cm for flax fiber in concrete. As a result, an increase in the shear strength of structural members composed of the flax fiber reinforced concrete offers strategies that may lead to substantial savings in construction materials, especially steel. For architectural applications, the results indicate good potential for a class of concrete biocomposites for use in a variety of building types in developing regions.",2002
Sustainable and durable reinforced concrete construction,cracked reinforced concrete; durability; galvanized reinforcement; high volume fly ash; recycled-aggregate concrete; sustainable construction,,"Synopsis: Recycled aggregates used in combination with high-volume fly ash is an example of sustainable construction material because it represents a judicious use of resources by recycling by-products, that results in a lower environmental impact through reduced carbon dioxide emissions and reduced natural aggregate extraction from quarries. Furthermore, the related concrete mixtures yield satisfactory mechanical performance. The goal of the experimental work reported here was to investigate the effect of recycled aggregate and/or fly ash on carbonation and chloride penetration depth, as well as the effect on corrosion behavior of either bare or galvanized steel in cracked reinforced concrete. The concrete mixture contained equal amounts of fly ash and cement. The results show that the introduction of the sustainability concept in concrete technology by using recycled aggregate and/or fly ash did not cause any deleterious effects on durability of reinforced concrete specimens in terms of both chloride and carbon dioxide penetration, and reinforcement corrosion in cracked concrete.",2002
"Cementitious materials - Nine millennia and a new century: Past, present, and future",cements; history; concrete,HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE; HYDRATION; MICROSTRUCTURE; SIMULATION; RHEOLOGY; CEMENTS,"Cementitious materials have been used in construction for several millennia and through several civilizations.

The amalgamation of the science and engineering of these materials in recent decades has advanced the state of the art in their understanding and development. In a new century where sustainable construction is becoming an overriding consideration, the new scientific concepts can have direct impact on the way we use and formulate cementitious materials. On top of this, the scientific advances have provided the means for the potential use of the current portland cement as a platform to develop composite formulations of a high level of performance equivalent to and in some respects exceeding those of steel and ceramics. This may provide the basis for advanced and efficient construction techniques.

Residual design strength of cement-based materials for nuclear waste storage systems,,CALCIUM,"Calcium leaching of concrete may be critical for the mechanical integrity of hazardous waste storage systems, in which cement-based materials are employed as construction material or grouting material. Results from a recent triaxial strength test campaign on calcium depleted cementitious materials highlight that these materials exhibit decohesion and frictional softening and become increasingly pressure sensitive. But the overall emerging picture is one of a material with a residual, finite accountable strength, which is well above either the particulate or the matrix strength. This allows us to propose a 'safe' lower bound for calcium depleted cement-based composites, which may serve for the durability performance design of concrete structures subjected to calcium leaching-one critical design scenario of e.g. nuclear waste storage systems.

Wood in construction in Portugal - A promising future,wood in construction; wood structures; environment and sustainable construction,,"The design of Wood Structures in Portugal is, still today, a task that is not very interesting on the major part of points of view to the Portuguese Civil Engineers although it is more and more consensual for Architects that wood is the more appropriate material to be used in large Cultural Buildings, Exhibition Halls or Sports Halls, where large spans and floor heights are indispensable. Wood is also a material of very great interest for other structures such as small bridges for pedestrians and bicycles. Finally, we have lots of floor and roof wood structures on old Portuguese Buildings that need conservation and restoration and certainly the best solution, in general, is not to demolish and substitute them by concrete structures. In this context, this paper describes the actual situation of the use of wood as a construction material in Portugal emphasizing its use in Special structures and in Buildings. The Portuguese market is described in broad terms. Research and University teaching and a small description of the actual situation of how wood structures are designed in Portugal are also presented. Some photos of wood materials and structures, both in new construction and in Rehabilitation, are used as examples. The final conclusions emphasize the fact that wood is a material that must be treated with great respect, specially in what concerns old buildings, if Portugal wants to enter the club of the more developed countries that more and more are trying to take care of the environment and also to think in terms of creating construction solutions that last for more and more years with adequate maintenance and rehabilitation.",2002
Optimisation of industrial wastes reuse as construction materials,foundry residues; fly ash; waste reuse; construction material; recycled aggregate; waste stabilisation solidification; concrete,,"This study concerns the reuse of two inorganic wastes, foundry residues and fly ashes from municipal solid waste incineration, as ""recycled aggregate"" in concrete production. This kind of reuse was optimised by waste treatment with the following steps: waste washing with water; waste stabilisation-solidification treatment with inorganic reagents; final grinding of the stabilised waste after curing for about 10-20 days. Both the treated wastes were reused in concrete production with different mix-designs. Concrete specimens were characterised by means of conventional physical-mechanical tests (compression, elasticity modulus, shrinkage) and different leaching tests. Experimental results showed that a good structural and environmental quality of ""recycled concrete"" is due both to a correct waste treatment and to a correct mix-design for concrete mixture.",2001
Contamination of soil by crude oil and drilling muds. Use of wastes by production of road construction materials,,,"A thermal method of separating wastes into organic and mineral parts is proposed for processing crude oil sludges and oil-contaminated soils accumulated in operation of oil fields and oil pipelines. After exposure to heat, the content of the organic part in wastes decreases to 15-20 wt. %.

Contributions of NIST/NBS researchers to the crystallography of construction materials,cement; cement clinker; concrete; construction materials; durability; performance; materials science; stone,,"For more than 100 years, the primary theme underlying the NBS/NIST staff contribution to the crystallography of building materials has been the development of an improved understanding of concrete materials performance. Over that time period, portland cement concrete has become one of the most important of our construction materials for roads, buildings, and other large municipal structures. At the beginning of the 20th century our understanding of portland cement composition, performance, use in concrete, and how the concrete performs in harsh environments was lacking. The efforts of NIST have served to advance construction materials science and technology through the combined efforts of experimental, field study, and theoretical computational materials science. One major achievement in the late 1920s, derived from studies on phase equilibria in cement clinker, allows calculation of potential cement clinker composition. Known as the Bogue calculation, this continues to be an essential tool in cement plant process control to this day. Additionally, contributions of NIST scientists to our knowledge of the chemistry and nature of cement hydration products have been crucial in our understanding of cement hydration and concrete durability. Today, computational materials science is a rapidly developing discipline, and NIST is developing tools incorporating predictive models aided by empirical studies. Examples include a computer-integrated knowledge system for prediction and optimization of performance and life-cycle cost of high performance concrete and the Virtual Cement and Concrete Testing Laboratory. Understanding the relationships between material and performance properties has not been confined only to portland cements. One of the longest running experiments at NIST, the stone test wall, has stood for over 50 years as one of the worlds largest single collections of building stone, and is invaluable for studying weathering effects associated with stone mineralogy and texture. Standards development has also been promoted through participation on ASTM subcommittees on stone, cement, and concrete. The Cement and Concrete Reference Laboratory, established in 1929, continues to provide testing and training for outside laboratories and maintains a historical record of test data on construction materials.",2001
Sintering of MSW fly ash for reuse as a concrete aggregate,MSW fly ash; sintering; washing pretreatment; reuse,WASTE,"The sintering process of municipal solid waste (MSW) fly ash was investigated in order to manufacture sintered products for reuse as concrete aggregates. Four types of fly ash resulting from different Italian MSW incineration plants were tested in this study. A modification of the chemical composition of MSW fly ash - through a preliminary four-stage washing treatment of this material with water - was attempted to improve the chemical and mechanical characteristics of sintered products. The sintering treatment of untreated or washed fly ash was performed on cylindrical compact specimens (15 mm in diameter and 20 mm in height) at different com act pressures, sintering temperatures and times. The sintering process of untreated MSW fly ashes proved to be ineffective for manufacturing sintered products for reuse as a construction material, because of the adverse chemical characteristics of these fly ashes in terms of sulfate, chloride, and vitrifying oxide contents. A preliminary washing treatment of MSW fly ash with water greatly improved the chemical and mechanical characteristics of sintered products and, for all the types of fly ash tested, the sintered products satisfied the Italian requirements for normal weight aggregates for use in concretes having a specified strength not greater than 12 and 15 N/mm(2), when measured on cylindrical and cubic specimens, respectively. A compact pressure of 28 N/mm(2), a sintering temperature of 1140 degreesC, and a sintering time of 60 min were the best operating conditions for manufacturing sintered products of washed MSW fly ash.

An overview on the activation of reactivity of natural pozzolans,activation; reactivity; natural pozzolans; pozzolanic reaction; calcination; elevated temperature curing; chemical activators; strength; cost,CHEMICAL ACTIVATORS; CEMENTS; LIME; HYDRATION; STRENGTH,"Natural pozzolan is one of the oldest construction materials. Lime-pozzolan cements have been used for several thousands of years and have an excellent reputation for their durability. Pozzolans are being widely used as a cement replacement in Portland cement concrete. The use of pozzolans has the advantage of lower costs and better durability, but the disadvantage of a longer setting time and a slower early strength development. Different techniques have been tried to increase the reactivity of natural pozzolans to overcome these disadvantages. This paper has reviewed various methods used to activate the pozzolanic activity of natural pozzolans. All activation methods can be classified into three catalogues: thermal, mechanical, and chemical activation. A comparison based on strength-cost relationship indicates that the chemical activation method is the most effective and cheapest one.",2001
Moisture measurements in building materials with microwaves,construction materials; moisture transport; moisture meter; microwaves; concrete; sand; wood,,"The method requires two parallel boreholes in the specimen in which two microwave antennae can be moved. The moisture content in the material can be calculated from the microwave intensity transmitted between the two boreholes. Moisture profiles along the boreholes can be obtained by moving the antennae in steps along the length of the boreholes and taking measurements at each step. The microwave frequencies used in the laboratory measurements ranged from 8 to 16.5 GHz in steps of 0.5 GHz. The diameters of the antennae were between 7 and 9 mm, and of the boreholes between 8 and 12 mm. The microwave method produced measurement uncertainties between 0 and 2% by volume for all the materials studied in this report. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",2001
Environmental evaluation of materials and building processes: application of the life cycle analysis to the construction of an industrial hall,,,"Methodologies based on Life Cycle Assessment (L.C.A.) give the opportunity to realise a global and complete evaluation of the environmental effects of products from their production to their use and elimination (from craddle to grave); methods used for analysis are internationally wellknown and standardised. These methods are rarely used in construction materials area, although materials flows and energy consumption are important and constructions have a long way of life. A calculation methodology, based on ecofactors/ecopoints, has been used-for the analysis of industrial hall made of concrete, steel, or concrete/wood structure; materials but also construction process are compared at the point of view of their environmental impact. This analysis completes the technical and economical approaches for the construction owner and designer and gives a global view of the interaction between construction and civil engineering, and environment.",2001
The Dutch norm for the determination of natural radioactivity levels in construction materials applied to concrete samples,,GAMMA-RAY SPECTRA,"In the near future, Dutch legislation will set an upper limit for the natural radiation exposure of inhabitants in newly built houses. Therefore, it is necessary to have standardized procedures available for the determination of the radon exhalation rate of and the activity levels in construction materials. In this paper we describe a method for determination of activity levels in construction materials. This method comprises radionuclide-specific calibration of Marinelli-beaker geometries with a range of material densities. This standard method was validated in a round-robin involving 6 laboratories, organized by two of the authors (M.B. and H.J.G.) of this paper.

This article is concerned with estimates of masonry deterioration and the effects of covariates on the damage to bricks on the walls of five multiple-story buildings of a residential complex located in the Bronx, New York. In this case study, the damage of primary interest was a ""spall:' a physical separation of a portion of the brick face from the body of the brick Eventually, the face becomes so damaged that portions fall off. The result is an unattractive appearance and a hazard to passersby. In this study, spall damage was assessed by means of three different and independent condition assessment surveys: an expensive, precise, and hence very limited scaffold drop survey and two additional inexpensive, but more detailed photographic and visual surveys. The photographic survey was obtained by photographing the walls of the entire residential complex, and the visual survey was done by individuals walking around the periphery of each building and making a visual assessment of the damage to each wall. In the photographic survey, a large amount of incomplete data was unavoidable because of either poor photo angles or various physical obstructions. A binomial regression model using four categorical explanatory variables or factors was fitted to the observed photographic spall data. Sparseness of the data, the presence of outliers, and overdispersion were major problems encountered in selecting and fitting a suitable model. A small pilot survey, in which the relevant portions of the photographic and visual surveys were matched to 11 drop locations of the scaffold survey, recorded spall counts using each survey method. From this pilot survey, photographic and visual spall data were calibrated to the scaffold drop survey data. It was determined that of the two surveys, only the photographic spall survey was needed to predict scaffold spalls. The estimate of total damage from the photographic survey was then adjusted using the calibration results. Finally, a multiple imputation procedure was used to impute values for the missing data and obtain an estimate land its standard error) of the true spall rate over the entire residential complex. Sources of uncertainty to factfinders in legal trials are discussed and illustrated through the present case.",2001
Utilization of paper waste sludge in the building construction industry,paper waste sludge; compressive strength; splitting tensile strength; portland cement; industrial waste; mineral filler replacement; concrete mix; bahrain,,"This paper reports on the results of an investigation of utilization of paper waste sludge obtained from a paper manufacturing industry, as a replacement to the mineral filler material in various concrete mixes. The physical and chemical properties of the waste material were studied. Concrete mixes containing various contents of the waste were prepared and basic strength characteristics, such as compressive strength, splitting, flexural, water absorption, and density were determined and compared with a control mix. Five concrete mixes containing various contents of the waste, 0 (control mix), 3, 5, 8 and 10%, as a replacement to the fine sand were prepared with ratios of 1:3:6 by weight of cement, sand and aggregate, respectively. The test results revealed that as the content of the waste increased the water to cement ratio for the mix was also increased, since the waste has a high degree of water absorption. Therefore, additional amount of water was required for cement hydration. The results obtained showed that as the amount of the waste increased the basic strengths, such as compressive strength were decreased. A maximum of 5% content of the waste as a replacement to the fine sand in concrete mix can be used successfully as construction materials, such as in concrete masonry construction with a compressive strength of 8 MPa, splitting strength of 1.3 MPa, water absorption of 11.9%, with a density of 20 KN/m(3) (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

Assessment of the durability of concrete from its permeation properties: a review,air permeability; carbonation; chloride ingress; concrete; diffusion; durability; freeze-thaw deterioration; water absorption; water permeability,INSITU,"Concrete is a versatile and most popular construction material. Its long-term performance depends on the interactions with the service environment, in which the penetration of deleterious substances is highly significant. The latter can be considered solely controlled by permeation properties of the near surface concrete. This paper reviews first the various transport mechanisms which govern the ingress of deleterious substances into concrete and lists tests which could be used to determine these mechanisms. This is followed by a discussion on various mechanisms of deterioration of concrete in an attempt to highlight the transport mechanisms, which are relevant to each mechanism of deterioration. Finally, from the documented information the usefulness of permeation tests to assess the durability of concrete is discussed by presenting inter-relationships between the two obtained in laboratory studies.

Review of NDT methods in the assessment of concrete and masonry structures,NDT; concrete; masonry; radar; sonics; conductivity; bridges; buildings,IMPULSE RADAR,"This paper reviews the state of non-destructive testing (NDT) methods as applied to the civil engineering industry in the Millennium Year, 2000. The basic principles of NDT methods are described with particular reference to the five major factors that influence the success of a survey: depth of penetration, vertical and lateral resolution, contrast in physical properties, signal to noise ratio and existing information about the structure. The main NDT methods used in engineering investigations are discussed and illustrated with brief case histories from the literature. The integration of NDT surveys into the investigation of structures is described. The underlying reasons why NDT methods are perceived as 'not working' by the structural engineer are identified as: a lack of understanding of variability of both the construction materials used and NDT methods themselves.

Properties of roller compacted base course containing recycled aggregate and waste plastic strip reinforcement,compressive; split; flexural; solid waste; fiber reinforcement,,"Results are presented from an experimental investigation to evaluate the compressive, split tensile, and flexural properties of a roller compacted pavement base course material made from recycled crushed concrete aggregate, cement, fly ash, and randomly distributed strips of recycled high density poly ethylene (HDPE) obtained from postconsumer milk and water containers. The primary motivation for this research is the innovative reuse of several different solid waste materials into a composite pavement layer with better or equivalent performance compared to conventional construction materials. Results indicate that a mix containing only 8% cement and 92% waste materials can achieve a compressive strength up to 14 MPa and split tension strength of 1.5 MPa. It is found that the plastic fibers significantly improved the toughness characteristics of the stabilized recycled aggregate composite in split tension, and moderately in flexure. Therefore, the new cement-bound composite made primarily from recycled products offers lot of promise as an alternative material for civil engineering construction.",2001
Development of a test method to investigate the durability of glass-filament-yarns embedded in concrete,,,"For new construction materials the development of testing methods, which allow a rating of their durability on base of accelerated ageing investigations, is an important aim. The investigation of the durability behaviour of composite materials is to a high degree combined with the investigation of the bond behaviour between the glass roving and the concrete. The bond behaviour of textile reinforced concrete is influenced by the alkalinity of the pore water, which generally leads to decreasing tensile strength values of the glass roving. Furthermore hydration products can lead to a mechanical damage of the glass rovings. Hydration products grow into the glass roving and reduce the elasticity of the roving. The following report presents a combined testing method, which allows to investigate the changes of bond and strength characteristics of the system roving/concrete caused by climatic stress. It is necessary to distinguish between a variation of the tensile strength of rovings in the concrete and a variation of the bond between the two materials. The presented experimental results show the interaction of both parameters.",2001
An experimental study on behavior of variable I sectioned beams under flexure produced by normal and lightweight concrete,,,"Nowadays, prefabricated in industrial structures, having long spans and in structures having high loads with long spans, selected cross-sections and construction materials become important to produce optimal members. Researches on normal, lightweight concrete beams, having variable I cross sections according to moment variation along the span and stress variation along the section height will give important results for optimal design of members. As a result 1/1 scaled, variable sectioned I beams made of lightweight and normal weight concrete are tested and relation between load and deflection, cracking mechanism and energy absorption capacities are obtained and compared for both materials. Also, research had given idea if the calculation method being used for reinforced normal concrete beam members under flexure is valid and can be used for lightweight concrete members.",2001
Two parameters analysis of post-peak dynamic behaviour of high performance concrete,,FATIGUE BEHAVIOR; AMPLITUDE; FRACTURE,"As well known the seismic performance of reinforced concrete structures is strongly influenced by structural design and by dynamic behaviour of the adopted construction materials. In particular in reinforced concrete frames the contribution of concrete matrix to dissipative phenomena during oligo-cyclic loading, such as seismic events, may play a very important role in the case of steel fibre reinforcement. On the other hand the dynamic properties of steel fibre reinforced concrete (SFRC) are influenced by concrete matrix and by type, geometry and content of fibres. In this work by means of direct and cyclic tensile tests on notched cylindrical specimens is shown the essential contribution of high performance cementitious matrix to post-peak behaviour of steel fibre reinforced concrete. The results have shown that the fatigue life of SFRCs is controlled by two fundamental parameters: the crack growth rate under cyclic loading; the ductility of SFRC. The first one is essentially governed by steel fibre adherence to concrete matrix, while the second one to steel fibre reinforcement (type, geometry and content of fibres). The analysis of these two parameters may allow to design a high performance SFRC with enhanced fatigue life taking into account the role of steel fibre-cementitious matrix interface on crack growth rate of SFRCs. Very high performance cementitious materials specifically designed in terms of tensile strengths and interfacial properties (fibre matrix) have revealed a very high lifetime at high tensile stresses as compared with that of ordinary cementitious materials, even if they are steel fibre reinforced.",2001
An analytical-numerical framework for the study of aging in fiber reinforced polymer composites for civil engineering applications,FRP composites; aging; viscoelasticity; failure; finite elements; civil engineering,COMPRESSION; DURABILITY,"Fiber-reinforced composites have many well-known structural advantages when compared to traditional construction materials like steel and concrete. On the other hand, due to its relative recent appearance in the market, questions about durability and aging are still a subject of discussion and research. As a consequence, in the last few years there have been available a growing amount of information on composites aging considering effects as temperature, oxidation, UV radiation, permanent loading, etc. Most of this research is performed at the materials level and thus it is not directly applicable to the design stage. In this paper, an analytical-numerical framework for the compilation, interpretation and application of experimental data to actual engineering analysis and design, is proposed. The formulation includes elastic anisotropic relations; aging viscoelastic anisotropic constitutive equations in terms of state variables; age-adjusted failure and degradation criteria; all in a setting of large displacements with small strains. These equations are set in a form adequate for numerical analysis in a Finite Elements context, taking account of thermal and hygrometric effects and using an incremental-iterative solution procedure accounting for strain-softening post-critical effects.",2001
Structural strengthening using advanced composite materials: A case study,,,"An upgrading exercise at a public housing estate initiated by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) of Singapore required that a three level car park structure be strengthened due to the conversion of the roof deck into a multi-purpose recreational area. The resulting increase of dead and live loads on the roof deck precipitated the need for strengthening the reinforced concrete beams, slabs and columns of the twenty year-old structure. A design proposal was put forward to the HDB for structural strengthening using advanced composite materials (ACMs). Prior to the acceptance of the proposal and the application phase of the project, the following study required by HDB to investigate the effects of strengthening existing reinforced concrete elements with ACMs was initiated in collaboration with the Centre for Construction Materials and Technology at the National University of Singapore. Beam, slab and column elements from the existing car park were removed from relevant portions of the structure and wrapped with the composite under various configurations. The strengthened and control specimens were then tested to failure and comparisons of the actual failure loads were made to the predicted ones. The test results on the extracted specimens showed substantial load carrying enhancements for the beam, slab and column elements strengthened with the ACMs.",2001
Overview of developments and research in wooden structures in Australia and New Zealand,timber structures; durability; connections; education; environmentally sustainable design,,"Despite the fact that timber is such a versatile construction material, during this last century it has significantly lagged behind developments in steel and concrete, particularly in Australia. Whilst use of timber in residential house framing has been well established in both Australia and New Zealand since the 1940's; for many years, concrete and steel were perceived as the only viable engineering materials for larger commercial and industrial structures. However, concentrated research efforts, focused education programs and technology transfers from overseas countries over the past two decades, have facilitated the use of timber in non - residential markets. As a result, there has been considerable activity in both countries focusing on innovative development and application of timber in ""engineered"" structures.

Timber bridges for the 21st Century - A summary of new developments,timber structures; timber bridges; wood; transportation,,"The 20(th) century can be characterized as the century of transportation technology. Early 20(th) century brought on the popularity of automobiles, and with increase in mobility, demand for more roads and bridges became evident. With this demand, and with the development of new construction materials, wood, that was the predominant material for building bridges in the 19(th) century, was soon replaced by steel and concrete in the 20th Century. The use of steel and concrete as the material of choice increased even more with the signing of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 that started the building of the US Interstate Highway System. However, even with all the increased use of steel and concrete, wooden bridges continued to be built on secondary and low-volume roadways as many still considered it an attractive material for short-span structures. Today there are approximately 40,000 timber highway bridges on public roadways in the United States (US) with span lengths greater than 6.1 m. In addition there are approximately 40,000 steel stringer bridges with timber decks. This paper presents a historical perspective on the use of timber bridges in the United States, briefly describing the various design types. It further summarizes the national timber bridge programs that are leading the way to new developments in timber bridge technology for the 21(st) Century.",2001
Interface durability of construction materials externally reinforced with FRP composites,adhesive; bi-material interface; bonding; concrete; durability; FRP composites; interface fracture; Mode-I fracture; wood,CONCRETE; BOND,"Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composites are being used for reinforcement of conventional construction materials (e.g., wood and concrete). Although increased stiffness and strength have been achieved by this reinforcing technique, there is a concern about the reliable performance of the bi-material interface bond, which can be susceptible to delamination. The objective of this study is to develop a qualification program to evaluate the service durability and fracture of FRP-wood bonded interfaces and to initiate a similar study for FRP-concrete interface fracture. Two types of FRP-wood interfaces are studied; Phenolic FRP-wood and Epoxy FRP-wood bonds, and interface fracture of carbon FRP-concrete assemblies is also characterized. The service performance and durability of FRP-wood interface bond is evaluated using a modified ASTM delamination test. An innovative contoured double cantilever beam (CDCB) specimen is used to evaluate Mode-I fracture of both FRP-wood and FRP-concrete interface bonds, and interface fracture toughness data are experimentally obtained.

Recent development of sustainable construction materials in Japan,sustainability; construction materials; research and development; applications,,"In Japan, sustainability has become an increasingly important issue over the past several years with the recognition of the finite capacity of natural resources, and several laws on the recycling and reuse of various industrial wastes were enacted in 2000. Sustainable or environment-conscious materials have actively been groped from the viewpoint of global environment protection in many fields of the Japanese industry. This trend is not exceptional in the construction industry. The development of the sustainable construction materials has proceeded actively with a great interest in recent years.

Design of reinforced concrete structures from a corrosion perspective: A computer model for structural engineers,,,"Acknowledged as a leading cause of deterioration, the corrosion of steel in concrete continues to be a focal issue worldwide for engineers who design reinforced concrete structures that will be exposed to chlorides in service. Faced with a wide variety of options from manufacturers of chemical admixtures and cementitious materials, and manufacturers of other construction materials such as stainless steel, galvanized steel and fiber reinforced polymer reinforcement (FRP), design engineers are expected to make reasonable comparisons on the cost effectiveness of the various systems. This process requires modeling of the initiation and propagation phases of steel corrosion, knowledge of repair options and costs, and an economic analysis to determine the best option for the desired several life. Several models are available in the marketplace; however, the assumptions used in their development and their input parameters often vary, further complicating the decision-making process for design engineers. To resolve these differences, a coalition of manufacturers and industry associations in the United States have sponsored the development of an industry-accepted service life prediction and life cycle cost analysis model. In this paper, existing and emerging technologies for corrosion protection of reinforced concrete structures are presented. Also presented in the paper is an overview of a newly developed industry-sponsored service life prediction model, Life 365, that incorporates some of the various technologies and allows designers and owners to make rational decisions regarding corrosion protection systems for reinforced concrete structures. Finally, a number of scenarios typical of the corrosion environment in California are modeled and presented in the paper. The exercise shows that with careful selection of the input parameters, reasonable estimates of the corrosion service life of reinforced concrete structures can be obtained with Life 365. The service life prediction model is based on a finite difference solution to Fick's second law of diffusion and was developed at the University of Toronto with funding from a consortium established under ACI's SDC. The funding members of the consortium were Master Builders Technologies, Grace Construction Products, the Portland I Cement Association and the Silica Fume Association.",2001
Legislative and environmental issues on the use of ash from coal and municipal sewage sludge co-firing as construction material,sewage sludge co-firing; ash management; heavy metals leaching,COMBUSTION,"For the economy of any co-firing process, it is important that the common waste management options of ash remain practical. Ash from bituminous coal combustion is typically handed to the construction industry. This paper describes the current European legislation on use of ash for construction purposes. Also, it presents an experimental study on the suitability of fly ash from combustion of mixtures of bituminous coal and municipal sewage sludge as additive to cement and concrete, and for use in open-air construction works, based on the ash chemical composition and the characteristics of the extract of the ash. Presently, two European standards forbid the use of ash from co-firing as additive to cement or concrete. This study shows that ash derived from coal and sewage sludge co-firing contains generally less unburned carbon, alkali, magnesium oxide, chlorine, and sulfate than coal ash. Only the concentration of free lime in mixed ash is higher than in coal, even though, at least up to 25% of the thermal input, still below the requirements of the standards. This ash also meets the requirements for the use of fly ash in open-air construction works - concentration and mobility of few elements - although this management option is forbidden to ash from co-firing. The leaching of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Bb and Zn was investigated with three leaching tests. The concentration of these metals in the extracts was below the detection limit in most cases. The concentration of Cu and Zn in the extract from fly ash was found to increase with increasing share of sewage sludge in the fuel mixture. However, the concentration of these two metals in the extract is not regulated. This study indicates that excluding a priori the use of ash from co-firing as a suitable additive for construction material could cause an unnecessary burden on the environment, since probably ash would have to be disposed of in landfill. However, allowing this requires the modification of current European standards to include limitations on all elements and compounds, absent in coal but which might be present in other fuels, that are deleterious for the quality of construction materials.

Life-cycle impacts of the use of industrial by-products in road and earth construction,life cycle analysis; LCA; by-products; road construction; earth construction; environmental impacts; environmental loadings,,"A two-stage study ""Life cycle analysis of road construction and earthworks"" was part of a, more extensive Finnish research project ""Assessment of the applicability of secondary products in earthworks"". In the first stage of this work a life-cycle impact assessment procedure for the comparison and evaluation of alternative road and earth constructions was developed. Additionally, a database containing the environmental burdens of the most significant construction materials and unit operations was constructed. In order to evaluate the applicability of the procedure, the use of coal ash, crushed concrete waste and granulated blast-furnace slag in road construction was evaluated in case studies. The use of these secondary products was also compared with the use of natural materials in corresponding applications. The aim of the second stage was to transfer the assembled data for utilisation as a practical model by creating an inventory analysis program to calculate and compare the life cycle impacts of the most common road constructions and foundation engineering methods. The data obtained in the first stage was also augmented to the extent necessary for this purpose. The results of case studies indicate that the production and transport of the materials used in road constructions produce the most significant environmental burdens. Production of the bitumen and cement, crushing of materials and transport of materials are the most energy consuming single life-cycle stages of the construction. A large part of the emissions to atmosphere originates from energy production. In the expert assessment, consumption of natural materials and leaching behaviour were also regarded as being of great significance. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",2001
Reuse of industrial sludge as construction aggregates,compressive strength; construction aggregates; high-volume wastes; industrial sludge; marine clay,,"Industrial wastewater sludge and dredged marine clay are high volume wastes that needed enormous space at landfill disposal sites. Due to the limitation of land space, there is an urgent need for alternative disposal methods for these two wastes. This study investigates the possibility of using the industrial sludge in combination with marine clay as construction aggregates. Different proportions of sludge and clay were made into round and angular aggregates. It was found that certain mix proportions could provide aggregates of adequate strength, comparable to that of conventional aggregates. Concrete samples cast from the sludge-clay aggregates yield compressive strengths in the range of 31.0 to 39.0 N/mm(2). The results showed that the round aggregates of 100% sludge and the crush aggregates of sludge with up to 20% clay produced concrete of compressive strengths which are superior to that of 38.0 N/mm(2) for conventional aggregate. The study indicates that the conversion of high volume wastes into construction materials is a potential option for waste management.",2001
"Light weight concrete: Ra-226, Th-232, K-40 contents and dose reduction assessment",building materials; dose reduction; Ra-equivalent; gamma dose; radon,HONG-KONG; INDOOR RADON; RADIATION,"Four types of light weight concrete (LWC) commonly used in Hong Kong, namely, autoclave aerated concrete (plus lime), autoclave aerated concrete (plus Pulverized Fuel Ash or PFA), concrete with synthetic aggregate 'Leca' and concrete with polystyrene bean as aggregate were measured for their Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 contents using high-resolution gamma spectrometry. All the radionuclide contents except those for the PFA autoclave aerated concrete were below the world averages of building materials. The Ra-equivalents for these four LWC were 49.6, 249, 122 and 44.2 Bq kg(-1), respectively, and were much smaller than a recommended limit of 370 Bq kg(-1) for construction materials for dwellings. The gamma-dose rate for an indoor environment with partition walls built with LWC was estimated to be about 20 x 10(-8) Gy h(-1), which corresponded to a reduction in the effective dose of about 0.25 mSv y(-1) when compared to that obtained for an indoor environment built with normal concrete (NC) only. The Rn s(-1), exhalation rates from the three lowest Ra-equivalent LWC were calculated as 0.509, 1.28, and 0.335 mBq m(-2) s(-1), respectively, which corresponded to a reduction in the indoor Rn concentration of around 14 Bq m(-3) and reduction in the tracheobronchial dose reaching 1 mSv y(-1) by using the James lung-dosimetry model, when compared to the case of NC.

Advances in materials applied in civil engineering,steel; concrete; high-strength concrete; high-performance concrete; carbon fibres reinforced polymer; bridges; tall buildings; offshore structures,,"This paper outlines the problems of the construction materials being used in civil engineering at the end of the 20th century and also of the construction materials of the future. The progress that have been made in the domain of basic construction materials such as steel and concrete over the 19th and 20th centuries is analysed. It is described how new materials such as carbon fibre reinforced polymer, high-strength concrete and high-performance concrete, create the possibilities of a further development. New opportunities for modem glued-timber structures are also presented. The limitations of the application of glass and plastics as construction materials are indicated.

Use of TBM muck as construction material,,,"Tunnel boring machines (TBMis) are widely used in tunnel construction in rock. The rock chips (muck) produced are rarely used for construction applications, however, because the suitability of the material is not well understood. Yet the cuttings appear to be of approximately the correct average size for some applications. If they are suitable in other respects, cost savings can be realized in tunnel construction, where aggregate is a common requirement. A review of standard construction aggregate specifications indicates that hardrock TBM muck would be suitable for several construction applications with a minimum of processing: road pavement and structural concrete. Processing options also are discussed for cases where the raw TBM muck is nearly, but not quite, suitable. A 0.65 metric ton (1420 lb) cuttings sample generated by a laboratory tunnel boring machine operating in a welded tuff is analyzed for suitability for different construction applications. In addition, numerous tunneling projects that use or have studied TBM waste for construction purposes are described. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",2000
Cements of yesterday and today - Concrete of tomorrow,portland cement; mineral component; admixture; high-performance concrete; sustainable development,,"Concrete, the most widely used construction material; is evolving. Modem concrete is more than simply a mixture of cement, water and aggregates; modem concrete contains more and more often mineral components, chemical admixtures, fibres, etc. Of course the utility market will stay the major market of concrete but niche markets implying the use of ""a la carte"" smart concretes will also develop. The development of these smart concretes results from the emergence of a new science of concrete, a new science of admixtures and the use of sophisticated scientific apparatus to observe concrete microstructure and even nanostructure. It is not sure that present cements are far superior to cements made 30 to 40 years ago. A high C3S and C(3)A content, a high Blaine fineness are not needed anymore to make a high-initial-strength concrete, it is simply necessary to lower the water/cement or water/binder ratio. Concrete compressive strength is a function of the closeness of the cement particles as well as cement dosage. In fact, reactive powder concretes testing 200 MPa are preferably made with coarse cements not so rich in C3S and C3A, that is, cements for which it is easy to control the rheology. Present cement acceptance standards that were very safe when 20- to 25-MPa concretes were the most used concretes are not always appropriate to test cements that are to be used in conjunction with superplasticizers to make high-performance concrete. Moreover, up to now too much emphasis has been placed on 28-day compressive strength and not enough on concrete durability. It is very important to design concrete mixtures that keep their 28-day compressive strength over the life of the structure under its peculiar environmental conditions. Finally cement and concrete will have to evolve in the respect of the environment within a sustainable development perspective, which means that more mineral components will be blended with clinker and water/binder ratios will be lowered in order to increase the life cycle of concrete structures and lengthen as much as possible the use of hydraulic binders and aggregates.

Mound soil as construction material,,,"Mound soils from some habitats of a common tropical species of termites were investigated with a view to the possibility of utilizing such soils for construction. The research program that comprises the evaluation of the geotechnical properties of the soil and a study of the compressive strength of mortar and concrete specimens containing mound soil showed that the soil could be used as an additive to enhance the strength of both mortar and concrete. Inclusion of mound soil in mortar matrix resulted in a compressive strength value of up to 40.08 N/mm(2), and addition of 5% of mound soil to a concrete mix of 1:2:4:0.56 (cement:sand: coarse aggregate:water) resulted in an increase of up to 20.35% in compressive strength.",2000
Factors influencing fracture behavior of old-new concrete bonds,anchor; bond; fracture; surface texture,REFRACTORY MATERIALS,"The fracture properties of anchor reinforced construction material composites (bonds) are determined by the uniaxial wedge splitting test using a simple material testing device. Such fracture tests on old-new concrete bonds with differently treated old concrete surfaces with and without anchor reinforcement have shown that the crack initiation properties are mainly influenced by the workmanship and quality of the interface between the old and new concrete. For this reason, only 50% of the resistance to crack propagation can be obtained for the interface by conventional treatments of the old concrete surface relative to the new or old concrete. By optimizing the surface roughness of old concrete surfaces, which must be matched to the aggregate size used in the old and new concrete, mechanical and fracture mechanical properties can be achieved that are comparable to those of the old or new concrete themselves. When anchors are used as reinforcements, they act as effective crack stoppers. Also, anchors reduced the width of edge cracks if the quality of the old-new concrete bond is appropriate, that is, has sufficient strength. Measures and strategies can be derived from the fracture mechanical behavior of old-new concrete bonds. They lead to an optimization and development of the quality of such old-new concrete bonds, as well as its anchor reinforcement.",2000
Comparison of the characteristic leaching behavior of cements using standard (EN 196-1) cement mortar and an assessment of their long-term environmental behavior in construction products during service life and recycling,pH; long-term performance; modeling; heavy metals; leaching behavior,IMMOBILIZATION,"The uncertain environmental properties of cements, when used in construction materials, during these materials' service life and any ""secondary life"" (construction debris), have been raised as matters of concern due to the increasing use of alternative fuels and raw materials in the manufacture of cement clinker. A comparison of the leaching behavior of a range of traditional cement types, assessed in standard mortar prisms, with two non-traditional special cements, made using alternative fuels/raw materials, has shown that the leachability from these special cements does not exceed the leachability from the traditional cements. For relevant constituents, such as Cr, even a lower leachability is observed in spite of a higher total composition. This illustrates that an evaluation of cement based on total concentration of either the anhydrous cement or the cement-based product, in which it is used, is not a valid means of judging environmental impact. The emphasis in environmental evaluation has been on the properties during service life of cement-based products. This stage of life of a cement based product has proved to be of limited concern. The emphasis should be focused on the ""second life"" of cement-based products. If construction debris is reused as aggregate in concrete, again leachability is of limited concern as the chemical environment dictated by the cement matrix ensures a low leachability. When construction debris are reused as hydraulically unbound aggregate, e.g., in road stabilization, environmental issues prove to be relevant as oxyanionic species (e.g., chromate, sulfate, molybdate, vanadate) may exceed critical limits according to Dutch regulations. With the possible exception of Cd, metals such as Pb and Zn are unlikely to become critical environmentally, even in the ""second life"" of cement-based products. When environmental criteria for cement-based products are developed they should be based on leachability of standard mortar and not on concentration to guarantee environmental compatibility during service life, ""second life"" and ""end of life"" scenarios.

Test protocols for migrating corrosion inhibitors (MCI (R)) in reinforced concrete,,,"Corrosion induced deterioration of steel reinforcement (rebar) in concrete has increasingly become a greater world-wide concern. This insidious dilemma focuses on the potentially dubious structural integrity of many concrete structures. The steady rise of rebar corrosion and the eventual deterioration can be directly related to several influential factors, some of which include; poor quality construction materials, the increased use of de-icing salts, severe marine environments and increased atmospheric contaminants, such as carbon dioxide. Over the years various methods have been developed to protect either the rebar or the concrete. Today, the most recent emerging corrosion protection technology is that of Migrating Corrosion Inhibitors (MCIs). Recently, improved test methodologies have been developed which can better assess the effectiveness of corrosion inhibitors. Several of these recent electrochemical and non-electrochemical test methods were utilized to measure the effects of migrating corrosion inhibitors. This paper includes an explanation of these test methods and presents an overview of the test results.",2000

"Alkali-aggregate reactivity in Newfoundland, Canada",alkali-aggregate reaction; concrete structures; laboratory tests; petrographic examination; rock types,,"Alkali-aggregate reactivity is a chemical reaction that occurs in some concrete structures. This reaction causes expansion and cracking of concrete. It may not be the main cause of premature deterioration; however, it is often the catalyst for other forms of deterioration. Since 1989, field work and laboratory testing for alkali-reactivity has been undertaken on selected aggregate, rock, and concrete core samples throughout Newfoundland. The field work and laboratory tests consisted of an assessment of the bedrock and aggregate sites to determine their quality and quantity for use as construction material; an examination of existing concrete structures to assess their durability with regard to alkali-aggregate reactivity. The site investigation of the concrete structures consisted of noting their date of construction, the rock and aggregate types used, the types of cracking, and the degree and type of deterioration of each structure. Results from laboratory testing, petrographic examination, and visual observation show that certain sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rock types may be potentially alkali-reactive, but the reaction may not always be deleterious to the concrete structure.",2000
Electromagnetic propagation into reinforced-concrete walls,electromagnetic propagation; finite-element method; Floquet modes; mobile communication,,"A rigorous method for analyzing building construction materials, using finite-element techniques and an expansion of fields in Floquet's modes, is exposed in this paper. It allows us to precisely study the electromagnetic properties of buildings walls in terms of transmission and reflection characteristics, which can be useful in the design of wireless communication systems. First, we present the influence of the wall's parameters, namely, its thickness, the square side length, and the steel diameter of a concrete grid. The influence of the angle of arrival of the incident wave and the effect of considering the diffused field on the electromagnetic properties are then presented.",2000
Reuse of industrial sludge as pelletized aggregate for concrete,,BRICKS,"Industrial sludge is generated at a rate of 100 metric tons/day, from a copper slag recycling plant. The industrial sludge is currently being landfilled. However, limited availability of landfill sites has raised the need of an alternative disposal. A renewed interest in converting the industrial sludge into construction materials has been prompted to achieve a viable disposal option in saving the depleting natural resources of raw materials as well as the environment. This study describes the use of sintered sludge pellets as a complete replacement for regular granite aggregates in concrete. The pelletized sludge was fired to a temperature of 1,135 degrees C at which the sintering process occurs, producing a hard fused basalt-like mass. In comparison with normal granite aggregates, the sintered sludge pellets display a higher aggregate strength, a higher porosity, and a lower aggregate density that manifests attributes better than that required of construction aggregates. The concrete cast with the pelletized aggregates achieved a compressive strength of 38.5 N/mm(2) after 28 days and was comparable to the control specimen. Leaching tests conducted on the sludge pellets and concrete showed that all leachate contamination levels determined using the column leaching test are within acceptable ranges after 130 days of stabilization. The experimental results indicated that a complete replacement of conventional aggregates with sintered sludge pellets for structural concrete is both technically and environmentally feasible.",2000
Minimizing the water sensitity of clay-shale-wood cementing composites,wood concrete; extreme dimensional variation; fiberglass; neutralization; hydrolysis,,"The use of clay and wood waste in construction materials points out to a sensitivity to water, which is susceptible to reduce their durability. This work has first been interested in the influence of different constituents on the extreme dimensional variations (EDV) of such cementing composites. A formulation allowing the conciliation of environmental imperatives, interesting mechanical and thermal characteristics, and low density has been proposed. However, the EDVs remain above the required objective. In order to reach this value, different treatments have been examined. The addition of alkali-resistant fiberglass in the matrix did not lead to satisfactory results. Not only is the reduction of the EDVs insufficient for reasonable proportions of fibers, but this treatment also increases the proportion of absorbed water in presence of liquid water. Taken separately, both types of treatments used for wood particles - neutralization with hydraulic binders and extraction with boiling water of hydro-soluble compounds - also do not allow a sufficient reduction of EDVs. However, the combination of these two treatments allows the achievement of EDV less than or equal to 1 mm/m. Such a treatment improves the mechanical resistance without significantly altering the thermal performances.",2000
High-volume fly ash system: Concrete solution for sustainable development,cements; durability; fly ash; mechanical properties,INCORPORATING HIGH VOLUMES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; DURABILITY,"The challenge for the civil engineering community in the near future will he to realize projects in harmony with the concept of sustainable development, and this involves the use of high-performance materials produced at reasonable cost with the lowest possible environmental impact. Portland cement concrete is a major construction material worldwide. Unfortunately, the production of portland cement releases large amounts of CO(2) into the atmosphere, and because this gas is a major contributor to the greenhouse effect and the global warming of the planet, the developed countries are considering very severe regulations and limitations on the CO(2) emissions. In view of the global sustainable development, if is imperative that supplementary cementing materials be used to replace large proportions of cement in the concrete industry, and the mob available supplementary cementing material worldwide is fly ash, a by-product of thermal power stations. To considerably increase the utilization of fly ash that ts otherwise being wasted, and to have a significant impact on the production of cement, it is necessary to advocate the use of concrete that will incorporate large amounts of fly ash as a replacement for cement. Such concrete, however, must demonstrate performance comparable to that of conventional portland cement concrete, and must be cost effective. In 1985, CANMET developed a concrete incorporating large volumes of fly ash that has all the attributes of high-performance concrete, that is, one that has excellent mechanical properties, low permeability superior durability, and that is environmentally friendly. This paper gives an overview of the properties of this type of concrete that is believed to be a very promising alternative for the industry seeking to meet the sustainable development objectives.",2000
Water treatment plant seismic upgrades,,,"Following the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) embarked on a $200 million Seismic Improvement Program (SIP) to increase the reliability of its water system. Four of the District's water treatment plants (Sobrante, Lafayette, Upper San Leandro, and San Pablo) were seismically strengthened as part of this program. These plants were built between 1919 and 1965 with a maximum capacity ranging from 163 ML/Day (43 MGD) to 303 ML/Day (80 MGD). This paper describes the evaluation and upgrade design of these water treatment plants. An evaluation of the entire water treatment system was performed to identify the critical components and structures essential to the continued operation of the facilities following an earthquake. This assessment included a risk and vulnerability analysis to determine which elements would require improvements to ensure satisfactory performance. Structural design criteria were established to meet the performance goals. Conceptual designs with cost estimates were developed to remedy the deficiencies. This information provided the data to prioritize improvement needs. The original construction of the four water treatment plants was representative of the use of various construction materials and framing methods common at the time of construction. Similar deficiencies were identified at each of the four plants: all of the operation buildings and filter galleries required a similar upgrade approach, shear walls and ductile concrete moment frames were provided to increase lateral resistance, diaphragms were strengthened, and connection to frames and walls were improved. Other improvements included upgrades to sedimentation basin walls and baffles, filter basin walls, pipe anchorage, tank anchorage, and emergency generator equipment anchorage. All improvements were designed for construction while the water treatment plants were in operation.",2000
Cement and concrete development from an environmental perspective,admixtures; belitic cements; concrete; environment; pozzolans; Roman concrete; supplementary cementitious materials; water/cement ratio,,"Concrete is the most widely used construction materials: mom than 2 tonnes of concrete were produced for every person on the planet. As the use of concrete will increase in the future due to the development do urbanization in developing countries, time has come to look at cement and concrete to environmental point of view; cement and concrete manufacturing is producing 8 percent of the annual amount of CO2 release in the atmosphere. The challenge is not to limit or forbid the use of concrete but rather to make more concrete having a lower impact on the environment. Different technological tools are already available but they have not yet received the attention they deserve. The three more promising avenues that can be implemented very rapidly are: a more efficient use of portland cement involving the use of chemical admixtures and supplementary cementitious materials; the production of low energy-intensive cement and/or cement with a lower lime content; recycling concrete. Special effort should be made to transfer very rapidly this technology to developing countries.",2000
Clean concrete construction: An Australian perspective - Clean concrete construction in Australia,life cycle; clean construction; closed-loop recycling; sustainable development; waste management,,"Ecologically sustainable development (ESD) is becoming one of the most important challenges for the construction industry in the new millennium. This issue is primarily driven by the need to conserve materials and energy resources so that future generations can have sufficient resources for their needs. Therefore, ESD strives to provide intergenerational equity. The construction activity is a major consumer of both materials and energy resources. With respect to construction with concrete, there are many opportunities to apply advanced concrete technology to enhance sustainability in construction. To ensure long-term sustainability, we need to adopt an holistic approach which views the entire life cycle of construction. This will include aspects of materials processing, product manufacture, transportation, construction, service life, demolition and disposal. Whilst the management of waste is one of the most important aspects in ensuring sustainable development, waste management alone is not sufficient. In taking a life-cycle approach, we need to adopt clean construction practices which encompass waste management as well as minimise the environmental impacts of precursor activities such as the manufacturing of construction materials. In this paper, a broad discussion of clean concrete construction will be discussed in the context of the Australian concrete construction industry. Examples of recent advances in concrete technology research and application in Australia which contribute to clean construction will be provided.",2000
Reflection and transmission control of electromagnetic wave for concrete walls,reflection; transmission; interference wave; concrete wall; triangular shaped wall; sinusoidal shaped wall; FD-TD method; wireless LAN,,"With an advance of office automation and intelligent offices, use of various electrical and electronic devices has proliferated. Accordingly, the interference of electromagnetic waves generated by these devices with other equipment, causing malfunction and wave leakage through walls, is of concern. Especially for wireless LANs, the degradation of communication quality due to the reflected waves from walls, floors, and ceilings is a problem. It is necessary to shield and absorb the interference signals by construction materials such as walls. In this paper, the surface shapes of the concrete walls are proposed to be triangular and sinusoidal to shield and absorb these interference waves. Their characteristics are analyzed by the FD-TD method. It is found that the triangle-shaped and sinusoid-shaped wails have larger power loss than conventional concrete walls, so that they can suppress reflection and transmission. Further, the effectiveness of the analysis is confirmed by experiment. (C) 2000 Scripta Technica.",2000
"Bridge 1-351 over muddy run - Design, testing, and erection of an all-composite bridge",,,"Bridge 1-351 on Business Route 896 in Glasgow, Delaware, was replaced with one of the first state-owned all-composite bridges in the nation. Composites are lightweight construction materials that do not corrode, which results in benefits such as ease of construction and reduced maintenance costs. A summary of the design, large-scale testing, fabrication, erection, and monitoring of this bridge is presented. The bridge was designed to AASHTO load and resistance factor design specifications. A methodology was developed to incorporate the engineering properties of these unique composite materials into the design. The bridge consists of two 13 x 32 ft (3.96 x 9.75 in) sections joined by a unique longitudinal joint. The sections have sandwich construction consisting of a core [28 in. (71.12 cm) deep] and facesheets [0.4 to 0.6 in. (10.16 to 15.24 mm) thick] that provide shear and flexural rigidity, respectively. The composite bridge was fabricated with E-glass preforms and vinyl-ester resin, which offers excellent structural performance and long-term durability. Each of the sections was fabricated to near-net shape in a single step by a vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding process. The overall structural behavior has been accurately predicted with simple design equations based on sandwich theory for anisotropic materials. Large-wale testing of full-sized subcomponents was conducted to prove that the design satisfied deflection, fatigue, and strength limit states. A redundant longitudinal joint was designed that consisted of both an adhesively bonded vertical joint between sections and splice plates. Assembly procedures were developed, and transverse testing of the full-sized joint was conducted. Final bridge sections were proof-tested to the strength tin-it state. The construction phase included section positioning, joint assembly, and application of a latex-modified concrete wear surface. The bridge was reopened to traffic on November 20, 1998. Results from the long-term monitoring effort will be documented.",2000
FRC for sustainable infrastructure regeneration and rehabilitation,,STEEL FIBERS; CONCRETE; SHEAR,"Three decades of intensive and advanced research have shown that it is now possible to produce high performance fibre cement composites capable of meeting any engineering demand in terms of strength, stiffness, crack control, toughness and energy absorption capability. However, the greatest challenge of the 21st century is the need for a cost-effective, durable and eco-friendly construction material that will meet the global needs of infrastructure regeneration and rehabilitation which alone can enhance the quality of life for ail the peoples of the world. This paper shows that a judicious combination of portland cement, pozzolanic/cementitious materials, chemical admixtures and fibres can produce a wide range of FRC materials that are durable, strong and stiff, highly crack resistant, very ductile and capable of large amounts of energy absorption. Such materials will find extensive applications in the construction industry. In particular, the development of durable natural fibre cement composites poses a gigantic challenge to the science and skills of engineering - a challenge which, if successful, can create the most exciting, eco-friendly construction material backed by an endless supply of renewable natural resources.",2000
Utilization of paper waste sludge in concrete,,,"The results of an experimental investigation conducted on the utilization of paper waste sludge obtained from a paper manufacturing industry as a replacement to the mineral filler material in various concrete mixes. The physical and chemical properties of the waste material were studied. Concrete mixes containing various contents of the waste were prepared and basic strength characteristics, such as compressive strength, splitting, flexural, water absorption, and density were determined and compared with a control mix. Five concrete mixes containing various contents of the waste, 0% (control mix), 3%, 5%, 8% and 10%, as a replacement to the fine sand were prepared with ratios of 1:3:6 by weight of cement, sand and aggregate, respectively. The results revealed that as the content of the waste increases the water to cement ratio for the mix must be increased, since the waste has a high degree of water absorption. Therefore, additional amount of water was required for cement hydration. Also, test results obtained showed that as the amount of the waste increases the basic strengths, such as compressive strength decreases. A maximum of 5 percent content of the waste as a replacement to the fine sand in concrete mix can be used successfully in construction materials, such as in concrete masonry construction with a compressive strength of 8 MPa, splitting strength of 1.3 MPa, water absorption of 17 percent, with a density of 20 KN/m(3).",2000

New horizons for high power lasers: applications in civil engineering,laser; materials processing; civil engineering; concrete; rock; cleaning; decontamination; glazing; coloring,,"Although material processing with high power lasers has found widespread use in a variety of industries such as the automotive industry, electrical and electronics industries, aerospace industry etc., civil engineering construction is one field that has lagged behind in the use of lasers for material processing. This is in spite of the fact that a large variety of materials including ceramics, metals and plastics are used in very large quantities for civil engineering construction. The main reasons for the delay in the adoption of lasers for processing construction materials seem to be the high costs involved and the lack of sufficient power for processing heavy and thick materials. However, with the advent of more compact lasers with higher powers, higher efficiencies and lower photon costs, greater interest has been shown in recent years in the possible uses of high power lasers for material processing in the construction industry. The author traces some of the past work carried out both in Japan and abroad on the use of lasers in civil engineering, specially with respect to the processing of inorganic materials such as concrete, natural stones, tiles and rocks. Recent developments regarding laser decontamination and laser assisted rock excavation are also introduced.",2000
Thermographic non-destructive testing damage detection for metals and cementitious materials,infrared camera; thermographic imaging; thermomechanical properties; conventional calibration; calibration by thermography; use of finite element method,,"The authors have explored the use of thermography as a non-destructive testing technique to detect geometrical defects in both metallic and cementitious materials which are widely used in the construction industry. The method is based on the characteristics of heat propagation within a conductive medium of specific geometry, which is intended to model predetermined boundary conditions. The test specimens have been successfully induced with various crack widths under controlled laboratory conditions in order to represent mechanical damage. The finite element (FE) method is applied as an analytical tool to predict the heat flow field. The analysis was formulated and processed as a two-dimensional problem, the thermomechanical properties having been accurately predetermined. The input preparation requires a number of trial-and-error attempts to generate the appropriate data for FE analysis. Experimental results relating to detection of geometrical faults in concrete, based on selected geometric parameters, show a satisfactory agreement with the numerical predictions. The results predicted by FE model:ling are also linked through representations by simple formulae, to include variables such as crack width and temperature difference for concrete and metallic materials. So far it has been possible to use thermography to estimate the extent of surface cracks in construction materials of both a metallic and a cementitious nature.",2000
Life cycle inventory analysis program for road construction,,,"The Finnish LCA-database and inventory analysis program for road construction was developed as a part of the Technology Development Centre's (Tekes) Environmental Geotechnology Programme. In the first stage of the study a life-cycle impact assessment procedure for the comparison and evaluation of alternative road and earth constructions was proposed. Additionally, a database containing the environmental burdens of the most significant construction materials and unit operations and the information required for the calculation of the data was constructed. In order to evaluate the applicability of the methodology the use of coal ash, crushed concrete waste and granulated blast-furnace slag was compared with the use of natural materials in corresponding applications. All the work stages from material production to road management as well as the materials most commonly used in the structural courses of road constructions are covered in the analyses. The environmental loadings dealt with have been limited to those assessed as being the most important. During the later phase of the work a practical calculation model based on the developed methodology and existing data was formulated. The data obtained in the first stage was also augmented to the extent necessary for this purpose. For example, leaching tests of natural aggregates were performed. The Excel-based life cycle inventory analysis program created is suitable for the routine calculation of the environmental loadings of the most common road constructions and for their comparison.",2000

The structures were built in accordance with general rules set by the pilot construction project team of Tekes's Ecogeotechnology R&D program, and were instrumented to measure and follow up the behaviour of the structure and materials.

Moisture measurements in building materials with microwaves,construction materials; moisture transport; moisture meter; microwaves; concrete; sand; wood,,"In order to assess the condition and evaluate the reliability of buildings and structures, it is essential to establish the moisture condition of structural elements of the building. NDT-methods are increasingly being used for such moisture measurements because they do not cause any damage to the building under investigation. Microwave transmission is one of the NDT-methods that has been in use for several years. The equipment used in this research has been developed at BAM over the last few years. The method requires two parallel boreholes in the specimen in which two microwave antennae can be moved. The moisture content in the material can be calculated from the microwave intensity transmitted between the two boreholes. Moisture profiles along the boreholes can be obtained by moving the antennae in steps along the length of the boreholes and taking measurements at each step. The microwave frequencies used in the laboratory measurements ranged from 8 to 16,5 GHz in steps of 0,5 GHz. The diameters of the antennae were between 7 and 9 mm, and of the boreholes between 8 and 12 mm. The moisture content measured by the microwave technique was verified by the moisture content determined by weighing. The microwave method produced measurement uncertainties between 0 and 2 % by volume for all the materials studied in this report. In some measurements and materials the differences were so small that they could be neglected. The accuracy of the results can be improved by eliminating some of the uncertainty factors. Special parameters for the quality of the material and the aggregate size were introduced in the moisture calculations. When these factors were determined for each material, it was possible to obtain comparable results for the microwave and weighing measurements.",2000
Construction materials from in-situ resources on the moon and Mars,,,"The development of permanent planetary outposts is constrained by the performance of construction materials and availability of in-situ resources. Lunar materials have a low calcium oxide (CaO) concentration and may be unsuitable for cement formulation. Nonetheless, lunar anorthosite rocks (17% CaO) and lunar basalt (12% CaO) have been successfully used in formulating a cementitious material. Elemental sulfur has also a variety of applications as a binding, non-hydraulic material for concrete. The main advantage of sulfur-based concrete in planetary enviroments is the avoidance of high-energy processes needed for hydraulic cement production and, mainly, the non-necessity of water. The major sulfur carrier in lunar samples studied to date is iron sulfide in the form of troilite (FeS), probably of meteoritic origin. However, the possibility of finding non-meteoritic sulfur-rich ores cannot be totally excluded. Martian soils appear to have been thoroughly mixed by repeated dust storms over perhaps hundreds of millions of years. The analytical results of soils at the two Viking sites (Chryse and Utopia, 1976) and the Pathfinder site (1997) showed close physical and chemical compositions in spite of enormous distances apart from each other. This chemical homogeneity of the soil on a global scale implies the availability of raw materials at virtually any location on the surface of Mars. In addition to concrete-based materials, other possibilities including ceramics (from microwave regolith sintering), cast basalt and ice (in the case of Mars) will be evaluated considering resource exploration and exploitation, processing and implementation possibilities.",2000
In-situ manufacture of Martian construction materials,,,"An essential step toward the establishment of a manned base on Mars involves the The manufacture of construction materials must minimally rely on resources derived from Earth. One basic material most beneficial for the construction of infrastructure such as habitats, storage structures or transportation construction is the development of Martian concrete. To produce concretes as well as a myriad of other operations most likely to take place at a manned base, a power source will be necessary. This power source must be adequate to operate a kiln as well as produce water by either manufacture or by permafrost extraction. Basic materials for the manufacturing of concrete in situ exist on Mars' surface. The Viking and Pathfinder missions have provided data that indicate the presence of calcium, sulfur and salts as well as large quantities of pozzolanic reactive silica. Forms of Martian concrete materials could be rudimentary brick, nonhydraulic or hydraulic cement concretes. Several considerations must be given to the manufacture of cement concrete or brick due to the ambient conditions found on Mars. Initially these considerations entail the collection of resources, power sources and the,workspace. Sequentially, considerations are given to ambient conditions effecting the properties of the materials. While each of the materials will require water as part of their manufacturing process, cement concrete manufacture will require a more elaborate system involving aggregate as weil as some Earth-derived admixtures. The manufacture of brick on the other hand may be more energy efficient and less labor intensive.",2000
Use of stockpiled asphalt and demolition debris in road construction in Norway,,,"The Norwegian company Franzefoss Ltd has during the period 1996-2000 carried out a R&D project on recycling of heavy building and construction materials (concrete, bricks, asphalt). A central part of this project has been to investigate the potential of these materials used as unbound aggregates in base course layers. Materials from two construction sites have been used for case studies. Laboratory investigations have been performed to characterise the materials, and the laying and compaction work in the field has been monitored. A preliminary conclusion is that both crushed asphalt and crushed concrete have high potentials. From a practical point of view, it is important to note that crushed concrete and crushed asphalt must be handled differently, both before and during construction. Crushed asphalt requires heavy compaction, while concrete (and bricks) are sensitive to deterioration and must be handled with care (light weight rollers etc.). The materials have different behaviour also due-to the mechanical properties (porosity, densities etc.). Hopefully this work will contribute to the on-going work with new Norwegian design standards and specifications, and open for wider use of recycled materials, in the future.",2000
Coupled size and boundary-condition effects in viscoelastic heterogeneous and composite bodies,materials; heterogeneous; composite; viscoelastic; minimum theorems; overall properties; boundary-condition effect; size effect hierarchies,REPRESENTATIVE VOLUME; SMALLER; MODULI,"Previous results of the author on the influence of size and boundary-conditions on the apparent properties of elastic heterogeneous materials are recalled and extended to the viscoelastic case. Materials with random microstructures, possibly with anisotropy, defects or damage, are considered. In place of the classical concept of effective properties, which holds for the representative volume only, the concept of apparent properties is recalled. It makes use of special kinds of boundary-conditions and appropriate stochastic averages for which the required Hill condition is still valid while the ergodic assumption - legitimating the use of the concept of equivalent homogeneous medium - is relaxed. Statistical apparent properties are defined on various partitions of a given initial specimen Do into a set of coarse specimens on the one hand, and of smaller specimens on the other hand. The boundary-condition and size-effects hierarchies derived in Huet (1990. Journal of Mechanical Physics and Solids 38, 813; 1997. Engineering Fracture Mechanics. (special issue) 58 (5-6) 459) are recalled. Examples of numerical verification by micromechanical simulations are shown using 3D finite element models of elastic granular composites. Some salient features of the viscoelastic behavior of non-metallic construction materials used in civil engineering are recalled. 3D simulations on viscoelastic micromechanical models are also shown, with results exhibiting trends similar to the elastic case and for which theoretical justification and generalisation is seeked in the paper. Use is made of a Statistical Continuum Thermodynamics approach through which the concept of equivalent homogeneous medium and effective properties is first discussed for materials with constituents having dissipative constitutive equations of any kind and from which natural definitions of dissipative potential and complementary energies are derived. Dissipative extensions of the so-called Hill condition are obtained. Then, new minimum theorems for viscoelasticity are derived from a slight modification of the pseudo-convolutive procedure used in Huet (1992. European Journal of Mechanics, A/Solids 5 (11) 653; In: Bazant, Z.P., Carol, I. (Eds.), Creep and Shrinkage of Concrete. Spon, London, pp. 189-200). From this, theoretical bounds and size-effect hierarchies on the statistical viscoelastic stiffness and compliance function tensors and their rates are obtained in the time domain. It is found that viscoelastic heterogeneous bodies smaller than the representative volume exhibit, for the two classes of uniform boundary-conditions, the same kind of size-effects as the elastic ones. Possible extensions to other kinds of time-dependent physical properties are quoted. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1999
Use of fiber-reinforced plastics versus steel for shear reinforcement of concrete,fiber-reinforced plastics; finite element analysis; reinforced concrete; shear strength,,"The use of fiber-reinforced plastics (FRPs) for the reinforcement of concrete structures is receiving much attention at present. Attempts are being made to better understand the behavior of concrete containing these fibrous materials. Much of this work, however, is aimed at attempting to fit present design guidelines to this wholly new construction material. This paper presents pushoff tests and suggests analytical techniques Sor the shear capacity of concrete reinforced with FRPs. As a basis for comparison, tests on specimens containing steel stirrups are also Presented. It is shown that while plasticity theory may be considered appropriate for use in the steel-reinforced situation, other analysis techniques are required for FRP-reinforced specimens. This is because the brittle nature of the new materials makes them susceptible to localized stress concentrations, which means that bond characteristics of these materials are particularly important. It is concluded that the choice of an appropriate analysis technique depends on the amount of debonding that FRPs are able to undergo during shear collapse of the concrete structure.",1999
Simulation of construction and demolition waste leachate,,SANITARY,"Solid waste produced from construction and demolition (C&D) activities is typically disposed of in unlined landfills. Knowledge of C&D debris landfill leachate is limited in comparison to other types of wastes. A laboratory study was performed to examine leachate resulting from simulated rainfall infiltrating a mixed C&D waste stream consisting of common construction materials (e.g., concrete, wood, drywall). Lysimeters (leaching columns) filled with the mixed C&D waste were operated under flooded and unsaturated conditions. Leachate constituent concentrations in the leachate from specific waste components were also examined. Leachate samples were collected and analyzed for a number of conventional water quality parameters including pH, alkalinity, total organic carbon, total dissolved solids, and sulfate. In experiments with the mixed C&D waste, high concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS) and sulfate were detected in the leachate. C&D leachates produced as a result of unsaturated conditions exhibited TDS concentrations in the range of 570-2,200 mg/L. The major contributor to the TDS was sulfate, which ranged in concentration between 280 and 930 mg/L. The concentrations of sulfate in the leachate exceeded the sulfate secondary drinking water standard of 250 mg/L. The leachate produced from lysimeters exposed to conditions of constant flooding possessed a greater concentration of dissolved constituents than leachate from the unsaturated lysimeters. The sulfate concentration ranged from 950 to 1100 mg/L. In both scenarios, the primary ions contributing to the dissolved solids were sulfate and calcium, both a result of gypsum drywall. The flooded lysimeters remained at a constant pH of 11 throughout the experiment, whereas the pH dropped to neutral conditions (pH 6-7) in the unsaturated columns after 1 month of the leaching experiment. The high pH of leachate from the flooded columns was attributed to concrete. Based on leaching tests on individual waste components, wood and cardboard were the primary materials contributing to dissolved organic carbon. The organic carbon concentrations in the leachate were generally lower than typical municipal waste leachate. The biological conversion of sulfate to sulfide was evident in many columns, and was most pronounced in the unsaturated, mixed-waste columns.",1999
Steel-fibre-reinforced concrete panels exposed to air blast loading,air-blast loading; steel-fibre reinforced panels; dynamic response,BOX-TYPE STRUCTURES,"Scaled explosive tests have been conducted to investigate the response of steel-fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) model structural elements. The structural-elements mere (a) rectangular panels, simply supported on two opposing shorter edges, (b) square panels, simply supported on all edges, and (c) fully fixed panels, in the form of an open box. Seven air blast tests were conducted. For each test, six panels were exposed simultaneously to air blast overpressure generated from the detonation of bare high explosives; charge weights ranged from 8 kg to 40 kg. The panels were fabricated with different types of steel fibre, fibre concentration and conventional weldmesh reinforcement. Test results indicate that, as a construction material, SFRC can make an important contribution to the integrity and resistance of blast-resistant structures. Details of the experimental investigation and response of the panels are presented. A single-degree-of-freedom model, which incorporates an elastic-plastic structural resistance function for the dynamic analysis, is used to predict the response. The deformed con figuration of the panels was computed at constant load steps, and the results were employed to evaluate the parameters of an equivalent dynamic model. Comparisons of computed and measured residual displacements are presented.",1999
"Properties of mortar, bricks, and masonry incorporating red and white sands",,,"A total of 144 mortar samples, 100 concrete bricks, and 6 concrete masonry walls were tested to determine the effect of sand type (white versus red) on their mechanical properties. The tests included compressive and flexural strengths, modulus of elasticity, drying shrinkage (epsilon(s)), specific gravity, and absorption. The main variables in this investigation were the sand type and mix proportions. All tests were carried out in accordance with the conforming ASTM standards. For the mortar specimens, the test results showed that, depending on the mix proportions, replacing red sand by white sand increased the compressive strength (f(c)') by 10% to 85%, flexural strength (sigma(f)) by 23% to 40%, modulus of elasticity (E) by 0 to 90%, and reduced the E, by 20% to 40%. The test results also indicated that the improvements in these engineering properties of the mortar increased as the ratio of the white to red sand in the mix increased. However, sand type had insignificant influence on the density and water absorption of the mortar. For the concrete bricks, the test results indicated that f(c)', sigma(f), and E of white sand bricks were, respectively, 35%, 60%, and 50% higher than those of the red sand bricks. Also, replacing the red sand by white sand reduced the E, of the concrete bricks by 30%. Furthermore, the results indicated that the tensile strength and ultimate strain of masonry walls constructed with white sand bricks and mortar were 27% and 67% higher than those of masonry walls constructed using red sand bricks and mortar. It is also noteworthy that white sand (pure quartz), due to its positive influence on the properties of mortar and concrete, may be used to prolong the life cycle of the infrastructure, particularly in severe environmental and service life conditions. On the other hand, its use in dwellings subjected to normal environmental conditions may be regarded as a waste of the national wealth. Therefore, its usage as a construction material should be carefully assessed in terms of the short and long-term benefits to the national economy.",1999
Multivariate analysis of truck drivers' assessment of work zone safety,,,"This paper presents multivariate correlation analyses of truck drivers' opinions on speed, hazards, roadway features, and traffic control devices in work zones (WZ). About 90% of truck drivers considered the WZ to be more hazardous than regular sections. A higher proportion of less-experienced drivers said so. Less experienced drivers and drivers who considered WZs more hazardous preferred one-lane closure layout. Speeds were correlated with driver age or experience. Half of drivers admitted exceeding WZ speed limits. About three-fourths said arrow boards were too bright and either too high or too low. More-experienced drivers were concerned about visibility, but less experienced ones were concerned with the clarity of the flagger's message. Pavement edge drop-off, loose construction materials, lack of shoulder, and lane width made over 85% of drivers and a higher proportion of less experienced drivers more uncomfortable. About 70-85% of the drivers considered the traffic control devices helpful. Impact attenuators were ranked highest, followed by cones and a third group containing barrels, tubes, and barricades. Of concrete barriers, 70% said they were helpful, but 28% said they do not like their use.",1999
Thermal inertia properties of autoclaved aerated concrete,,CELLULAR CONCRETE; FLY-ASH,"Autoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) is a lightweight, porous concrete with advanced thermal properties. AAC is unique among construction materials in combining excellent thermal resistance and thermal inertia. Generally, low-density construction materials do not provide good thermal inertia, while heavier ones commonly have poor thermal resistance. Five different 10.2 cm (4 in.) AAC samples made from U.S. electric utility fly ash as the silica source, along with three 10.2 cm (4 in.) conventional building material specimens, were tested for thermal inertia properties. Three primary issues addressed by these experiments were: (1) to develop and compare AAC thermal inertia to conventional building materials; (2) to document differences in thermal inertia characteristics of the AAC blocks produced by the various utilities; and (3) to determine if a periodic heat how model using the thermal inertia approach adequately predicts the observed thermal inertia parameters of a material. A theoretical periodic heat how model in the literature for thermal inertia did an adequate job of predicting the observed thermal inertia parameters for the AAC and conventional construction samples.",1999
Transfer bond stresses generated between FRP tendons and concrete,,REINFORCED PLASTIC TENDONS; BARS,"There is a growing interest in the use of new materials in construction. Materials such as fibre-reinforced plastics (FRPs) ave lightweight, strong, and, for the most part, non-corrodible. Hence, the use of FRPs as prestressing tendons for concrete represents a viable, durable alternative to conventional practice using prestressing steel. This paper addresses the nature of the bond between an FRP tendon and concrete in the transfer zone of a pretensioned concrete beam. In particular two different types of aramid fibre-reinforced plastics (AFRPs) ave considered. In the experimental investigation, the tendon pull-in behaviour during detensioning of a number of small-scale (100 x 200 x 2800 mm) pretensioned concrete beams was monitored These results were then used to make inferences about the bond stress distribution through the transfer zone. Both a constant and a non-linear relationship between the bond shear stress and the tendon slip were considered and the transfer behaviour of the two types of AFRP and steel were compared. It was found that by assuming a non-uniform bond stress distribution some interesting results about the distinctly different natures of the bond behaviour of the three materials were obtained.",1999
A high pressure permeameter for the measurement of liquid conductivity of porous construction materials,,HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONCRETE; WATER-PERMEABILITY; TRIAXIAL CELL,Equipment is described which provides measurements of the pressure and volume of unidirectional liquid flow through sample cores of porous solids. The real-time measurement of flow pressures enables any changes in conductivity resulting either from interactions with the flow liquid or from changes in effective stress levels to be monitored directly. The equipment can use a range of flow liquids and be adapted for miscible and immiscible displacement studies. It is particularly suitable for cement-based and stone construction materials.

Measurement of complex permittivity of asphalt pavement materials,,,"TO facilitate applications of road penetration radar and other nondestructive testing technologies on roads, an apparatus was developed for the measurement of complex permittivity of construction materials. The system consists of an automatic network analyzer, a sample holder, coaxial cable connections, and data processing software. The sample holder can accommodate either laboratory-prepared or field-drilled asphalt and concrete samples with maximum aggregate sizes up to 19 mm and lengths up to 400 mm. A computer program is used to convert the parameters measured by the automatic network analyzer into the real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity. The dielectric constants of 43 laboratory-prepared asphalt samples of fairly consistent bulk densities were measured over the frequency domain of 0.1 MHz to 1.5 GHz. The average dielectric constants were 6.0 +/- 0.15 for dry specimens and 6.52 +/- 0.99 for soaked samples over the frequency range of 8-900 MHz. A linear relationship was observed between the gravimetric moisture content and dielectric constant up to a moisture content of 1%, with dielectric constant increasing by 0.62 for every 1% increase of moisture content. The results indicate that the asphalt content and mix type did not significantly affect the dielectric constants, whereas the moisture content was identified as the predominant factor. The results provide much needed information on the dielectric properties of asphalt pavement materials.",1999
The application of rubber dams for water supply in Hong Kong,fabridam; flood mitigation; Hong Kong; rubber dams; water supply,,"There is a long history of the use of inflatable dams (rubber dams) in Hong Kong. Three inflatable dams were constructed in the 1960s as an integral part of the Plover Cove water supply scheme which was the largest project in Hong Kong at that time. However, because most civil-engineering structures are constructed from steel, concrete, soil and rock, the use of rubber as a construction material is subject to much scepticism. The problems and counter-measures associated with the use of rubber are discussed, based upon the experience of several departments which have used the dams in Hong Kong, and in other parts of the world.",1999
C-scan and L-scan generated images of the concrete/GFRP composite interface,,THIN-VISCOELASTIC PLATE; LEAKY LAMB WAVES; NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION; ULTRASONIC MEASUREMENT; PHASE-VELOCITY; ATTENUATION; THICKNESS; DENSITY; DEFECTS,"Glass Fiber Reinforced Plastics (GFRP) are fast becoming a viable new construction material. They are being used for rehabilitating old concrete structures-columns, beams, slabs and walls-by gluing the composite plate to the concrete surface. Proper attachment between the GFRP plate and the concrete surface is necessary for efficient use of GFRP composites to increase the strength of the rehabilitated structures. Delamination between the rehabilitated structure and the GFRP plate significantly reduces the strength of the reinforced structure. Hence, delamination defects, if present at the interface, should be detected as soon as possible. In this paper, two ultrasonic techniques to detect delamination defects between the GFRP plate and the concrete surface ape presented. One technique uses longitudinal waves or P-waves and the second technique uses Lamb waves. It is found that both techniques can detect the defect when used properly. However, Lamb waves give a better image quality of the defect than longitudinal waves. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.",1999

Measurement of the pore size distribution of geomaterials using conductometric phase transition porosimetry,,,"In cold regions, the performance of many construction materials is highly influenced by the pore structure of these materials. The durability of aggregates, Portland cement concrete pavements, and compacted clay liners and covers are heavily influenced by the pore size distribution (PSD) of these geomaterials. Cold region phenomena such as frost heaves and frost boils are also greatly influenced by the PSD of in-situ soils. Recently, a new method for measuring the PSD of geomaterials has been developed. This method has been referred to as conductometric phase transition porosimetry (CPTP). CPTP was first introduced by Gunnink et al., 1988. With CPTP, changes in electrical conductance and temperature of saturated samples are measured during a cycle of capillary freezing and melting. These measurements are used to calculate the sample's PSD. The paper includes an introduction to CPTP, a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of CPTP, a description of test methods and procedures that have been developed to use CPTP to measure the PSD of concrete and soil samples, and a summary of experimental test results. The test results section includes a comparison of mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) results with CPTP results for Portland cement mortar and compacted soil samples. It also includes results that illustrate how CPTP can be used to monitor changes in PSD that result from freezing and thawing of Portland cement concrete samples. The experimental results show that CPTP is a useful and valuable tool for quantitative studies of geomaterial pore size distributions.",1999
Effects of microbially influenced degradation on massive geothermal field concrete structures,,,"There is a need to estimate the effect of environmental conditions on concrete construction materials. For that reason it is important to develop a baseline of those physical/chemical/biological effects that influence the stability of massive concrete structures. While most physical/chemical causes and effects have been documented, those caused by microbially influenced degradation (MID) have not. It has been shown that the most effective way to obtain quantitative data on the effects of MID on the structural integrity of concrete is to study structures known to be susceptible to MID. Personnel from Biodegradation Systems Inc. (BSI) have been evaluating the effects of physical/chemical and MID on selected, massive concrete structures since 1993. Altogether over 240 samples have been recovered and analyzed for the presence of MID microorganisms. Results from those examinations, as well as the one reported here, demonstrate that massive, above ground, concrete structures can be inhabited by a variety of microorganisms known to promote MID of concrete. This report contains information obtained from a fact-finding visit to the Comision Federal de Electricidad at Cerro Prieto near Mexicali, Mexico. At this site steam production currently occurs at over 200 established wells. It was noted during the visit that all concrete structures at Cerro Prieto are in various stages of degradation due to the geothermal environment. Degradation was most obvious with the 150 or so concrete silencers dedicated to the steam production wells. Over 100 of them are in desperate need of repair or replacement at a projected cost of 10,000 US$ each. Because of these problems, the Comision Federal de Electricidad is very interested in the possibility of construction of degradation resistant concrete silencers. Management of the steam production facility is anxious to test a cement which will withstand the rigors of the geothermal environment. They would entertain a plan of having LaFarge supply SEWPERCOAT cement that could be used for repair work and having BSI monitor the durability over a three-to-five year time period.",1999
"Concrete, the durable building material",concrete; durability; portland cement; stucco; weather resistance,,"When the decision was made to construct the huge gravity base structure for the Hibernia oil extraction project off the coast of Newfoundland, the construction material that was chosen was concrete. Further, the material of choice for the Confederation Bridge was concrete. In another totally different vein, the paving material for the recently constructed Highway 407 around Toronto was also selected to be concrete. These three projects, widely different in character and function, all had the same underlying specification...a need to satisfy long term performance criteria. The watchword is DURABILITY. Concrete is recognized as a material which can be made to last, whether it has to face pack ice pressures, pounding waves, freezing and thawing conditions or heavy vehicular traffic. However, there have been known cases where concrete systems have deteriorated prematurely. Parking structures represent a well known example, where inappropriate material specifications, design criteria and construction practices often combined to compromise long term resistance to freeze/thaw exposure and deicing salt corrosion. Stucco cladding systems represent another area where less than ideal material specifications, detailing and construction practices have combined to cause unacceptable performance consequences. Recognizing serviceability criteria, any concrete mix can be proportioned to provide the necessary properties in both the fresh and hardened states to perform satisfactorily. Durability is the watchword. Long term performance of any concrete related construction can be successfully achieved through careful attention to material specifications, application and details.",1999
The best concrete for your project,,,"The ""best concrete"" for any project is the one that is readily available, can satisfy the design requirements and is cost effective. Unnecessarily restrictive, or uncertain specifications and poor constructability designs however, can negate the merits of a good concrete supply. The quality of production and field controls and lack of proficient supervision and workers further mitigates the potential to achieve what should normally be high quality concrete work. Although concrete is the most widely used construction material, the totality of the design through to curing process is often given casual attention, which can produce less than desirable results. This paper will discuss the basic considerations that need to be addressed to produce the ""best concrete"" work from normal sources as assured by proper field controls.",1999
Using locally available materials and methods,,,"Keeping up with the advancement of technology and awareness of the innovative construction materials and methods is imperative for engineers, architects and builders. However, in certain projects, it is important to study the feasibility and economy of locally available materials and methods before rushing into specifying the state-of-the-art technology and the most modern materials. Sometimes locally available low-tech solution may provide the most economical choice. This paper presents a case study on the construction of two reinforced concrete foundations for heavy forging presses in an industrial plant, where locally available materials and methods were utilized.",1999
High volume fly ash cement,,,"There is world-wide interest to develop advanced construction materials that are both cost effective and are produced with a minimum negative impact on environmental quality. One key element is the proper use of by-product materials that can enhance performance, reduce cost and environmental impact. More than 50 million tons of fly ash are produced each year in the United States, but only 25 percent is used. Fly ash, which is a by-product of the coal combustion process, has been used as a filler, cement replacement, and even pelletized as an aggregate for concrete. By utilizing this vast resource, electrical utilities and their customers can realize significant cost savings by avoiding disposal fees. High volume fly ash cements have been produced and tested over the last few years. ""High volume"" is a relative term, but is typically used to designate blended cements incorporating fly ash at concentrations of more than 40 percent by weight of the total cementitious content. Typical concerns for using high volume fly ash cements are concrete performance at early ages, and durability, particularly sulfate resistance (Class C ash). Recently, a very high volume fly ash cement has been developed and licensed to a commercial manufacturer. This environmentally sustainable, ""green,"" cementitious material incorporates 90 per cent fly ash by weight of the total cementitious content. Concrete produced with this ""green"" binder has been shown to produce excellent short and long-term strengths as well as excellent durability.",1999
State-of-the-art Portland cement production,,,"In addition to being a primary component of concrete, portland cement also accounts for the majority of the energy expenditure required to produce concrete - some 5.25 gigajoules per tonne (4.5 million BTUs per short ton) of cement. Along with the energy cost, however, significant by-products of cement production such as carbon dioxide (one tonne for each tonne of cement) and particulate emissions have raised environmental concerns and questions about the use of cement as a sustainable construction material. This paper examines these issues by reviewing the construction of one of the newest portland cement plants in the Southeast. The Thompson S. Baker Cement Plant, owned and operated by Florida Rock Industries, is a $100 million state-of-the-art giant being constructed in Newberry, Florida and is scheduled for plant start-up in August 1999. Public controversy, siting concerns, and environmental boycotts delayed the project for several years. Facts about the siting, environmental compliance, burning of tires and hazardous/toxic materials, and proposed production operations are examined from the perspective of using this case study for focusing on the sustainability issues related to portland cement production for existing, as well as future, cement plant operations.",1999
High volume uses of coal combustion products (CCPs) in highway construction,,,"In 1997 over 105 million tons of coal combustion products (CCPs) were produced by coal fired electric utilities in the United States. Overall usage of CCPs in 1997 was 29 million tons and approximately 65% of this use was in the construction industry and much of that was directly related to the construction of roads and bridges. The CCPs fly ash and bottom ash are both valuable materials in the construction field. In addition to fly ash used as a pozzolan in concrete, fly ash and bottom ash may be used in structural fill, flowable fill, soil and base stabilization applications, and as mineral filler in asphalt. As the quality and supply of traditional construction materials decrease and prices increase CCPs will become more widely used. Flowable fill, structural fill and soil stabilization applications are excellent opportunities for high volume uses of CCPs that are technically sound, commercially competitive and environmentally safe.",1999
Hypoplastic description of the interface behaviour,,,"Localized shear zones occur during shear deformation at contact of soils with construction materials (concrete, steel), and a proper modelling of foundation structures should consider the behaviour of these interfaces. A 1-D stress-strain relation for localized behaviour is proposed. It is based on the theory of hypoplasticity and it can take into account the influence of pressure and density on the mechanical response of granular materials. Nevertheless, no characteristic material length is included, thus the shear band width cannot be predicted. An application of the proposed contact relation in a FE calculation of a pull-out experiment is also shown.",1999
Adhesion and integrity of joints between construction materials,,,Repair of concrete structures often involves breaking out cracked concrete and replacing it with a new material; either a mortar or concrete. Integrity at the interface is an important property for the success and durability of the repair. This paper describes an experimental programme to assess the interface integrity by measuring adhesion strength and permeability. The work is described in two parts. Part 1 deals with the relationship between adhesion strength and air permeability at the interface between concrete and concrete. Part 2 examines the adhesion between concrete and a range of materials including polymers and polymer modified cementitious mortars.,1999
Adhesion and the new series of European standards on protection and repair of concrete structures,,,"Within the last years great effort has been made to harmonize the standards for products and systems used in the field of protection and repair of concrete structures within the Member States of the European Union. The standard on General Principles has been published recently. The regulations of it mainly address to the design engineer. They include: inspection, testing and assessment before, during and after repair; protection from, and repair of defects caused by the influence of the environment or other chemical substances; repair of defects from such causes as mechanical damage, differential settlement, loading (including seismic and impact loading), biological attack, inadequate construction or use of unsuitable construction materials; protection and repair in order to decrease the progress of alkali-silica reaction; meeting the required structural capacity in repair by replacement or addition of embedded or external reinforcement or by filling of external voids between elements to ensure structural continuity; meeting the required structural capacity by replacement or addition of concrete; waterproofing as an integral part of protection and repair; protection and repair of pavements, runways, hard standings and floors, integral part of protection and repair; methods of protection and repair. The selection of products and the relevant requirements are derived from the intended uses of the products or systems. The intended uses are consequences from principal solutions and specific methods to achieve the relevant aims. Much freedom and responsibility is given to the design engineer. The material specification standards are in the draft status at the time. But it is already possible to refer to these standards concerning the central importance of adhesion tests and adhesion requirements.",1999

Special sensors for deformation measurements of different construction materials and structures,optical fibers; fiber optic sensors; monitoring; dam monitoring; membrane monitoring; very early age of concrete; hardening time of concrete; mortar monitoring; SOFO sensors,,"SOFO is a fiber optic sensor system that allows the monitoring of micrometer deformations over measurement bases up to a few meters. It is particularly adapted to measure civil structures built with conventional civil engineering materials (concrete, steel and timber). It has been successfully tested in different type of structures such as bridges, tunnels and piles. The application of the system is however limited in some case when unusual materials are used in the construction and in other cases by the dimensions of the standard SOFO sensors. To extend the domain of application of the current system, special sensors have been developed. In this paper we present four special SOFO sensors: long, membrane, thin and stiff sensors. The long sensor has a measurement basis of several tenths of meters and its purpose is the measurement of deformations in massive and large structures (dames, tunnels). The membrane sensor is for use on laminated materials (e.g. membrane roofing) and it is easy to install by simply gluing it to the structure to be monitored. Since standard sensors can not be used for thin mortar layers because of their cross-section, a thin sensor has been developed, too. Finally, the aim of the stiff sensor is to determine the hardening (solidification.) time of concrete. This time is determined by comparing the deformations of a stiff and a standard sensor, closely placed in the concrete at the very early age. The design of these sensors is presented along with significant application examples.",1999
"Recyclable waste as a resource of construction material: policy and practice in the Netherlands (Reprinted from Trans. Instn Min. Metall., vol 108, 1999)",,,"At present, about 15 000 000 t of recycled material is used annually in construction in the Netherlands, yet about 40 000 000 t of the waste produced in the country is more or less suitable as construction material. The Ministry of Transport and Public Works is pursuing various measures to increase recycling, so that by 2010 20% of the demand for construction materials, or about 25 000 000 t/year, is expected to be met from waste. Obstacles to increased recycling include the presence of contaminants, which either impair product quality or incur treatment costs, and possible health hazards, e.g. from asbestos, radiation and leachates. The recycled tonnage is mainly reuse of concrete and brick debris; the Netherlands produces large quantities of dredging sludge, but separation of this into clean sand and a polluted silt fraction for disposal is currently economic only where the sand constitutes more than 50%.",1999
Experimental studies of concrete activation at the national ignition facility using the rotating target neutron source,,,"Two samples of concrete for possible use as a structural support material of the National Ignition Facility Target Chamber were irradiated with 14 MeV neutrons from the Rotating Target Neutron Source at U.C. Berkeley. Dose rate measurements were taken, using a Victoreen 450P pressurized ion chamber, from the front and rear faces of each concrete slug. The measured dose rates were compared to simulated dose rates calculated by the codes ACAB and TART. The results of the experiment have validated the results of the code calculations. Construction material decisions were made partially based on the agreement of experiment with simulation.",1998
Weight versus cost: Light-weight materials in cable-stayed bridges,,,"The weight advantage of light-weight construction materials such as steel or fiber-reinforced plastics is usually accompanied by the disadvantage of greater costs when compared with, e.g., reinforced concrete. This cost disadvantage makes light-weight materials uneconomical for many kinds of structures; because the advantage of reduced weight cannot efficiently be transformed into a cost benefit. For certain kinds of structures, however, weight reduction at the right locations conveys cost savings large enough to compensate for the higher material cost. Typical examples are high-rise buildings and long-span bridges, where light-weight materials can result in overall cost savings when used in the upper floors of the building or in the midspan region of the bridge. The weight-versus-cost problem is analytically investigated for a fan-type, cable-stayed bridge. A break-even point is determined that indicates the extension of the main-span center part that should be made of lightweight material to minimize overall costs. Results of example calculations are presented.",1998
Development of tire-added latex concrete,concrete strength tests; construction materials; impact energy absorption; scanning electron microscopy; surface bond; tire-added latex concrete; tire crumb rubber,,"Tire-added Inter concrete (TALC) was developed to incorporate recycled tire rubber as part of concrete. Crumb rubbers from tires were used in TALC as a substitute for fine aggregates or styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) latex, while maintaining the same water-cement ratio. Various static and dynamic strengths of TALC were measured and compared to those of conventional and latex-modified concrete. TALC showed higher flexural and impact strengths than those of portland cement and latex-modified and rubber-added concretes. Microscopic pictures taken using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) seem to support that there is better bonding between crumb rubbers and portland cement paste due to latex. TALC showed potential of becoming a viable construction material to enhance brittle concrete while incorporating waste tires.",1998
Evaluation of rubber-filled concrete and correlation between destructive and nondestructive testing results,portland cement concrete; crumb rubber; plastic and elastic energy; nondestructive testing,,"Over recent years significant emphasis has been placed on the use of recycled products in highway and construction materials. Waste materials, such as tire rubber, plastic, and glass may be used with conventional materials either as aggregate replacement or binder enhancement. For portland cement concrete, rubber from granulated tires may be used as an elastic aggregate modifying the brittle failure of concrete and increasing its ability to absorb higher amounts of energy before failure. The replacement of coarse aggregate with rubber particles may significantly compromise strength characteristics of concrete due to the high compressibility of rubber particles, generating localized stresses and bonding problems between the rubber particles and the cement matrix. To the contrary, the use of fine graded rubber as partial replacement of fine aggregates may produce a ductile behavior with large deformations prior to full disintegration of concrete and affect to a lesser degree the strength loss. An experimental study is being conducted to evaluate the effects of incorporating crumb rubber, very fine tire rubber particles, into Portland cement concrete. The objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of rubber aggregate into portlant cement concrete (PCC) properties. Initially, the rubber content replacing fine aggregates into the concrete mix was investigated by examining the concrete failure characteristics and the amount of energy absorbed during testing. The destructive testing results of the rubber-filled concrete were then coupled with nondestructive testing (NDT) evaluation. The scope of this effort was first to use a well-accepted NDT method for evaluating this specific PCC type, and second, to correlate strength and static elastic modulus to parameters evaluated from the dynamic NDT testing. These relationships may be used for estimating concrete strength and static elastic modulus from NDT results. Nondestructive testing techniques are relatively simple and quick to perform and provide the advantage of using the same samples again and again. NDT techniques are also of particular value in quality control testing.",1998
"Conclusions of the workshop: standards, measurements and testing for solid waste management",,,"The quality of waste treatment processes and of final (recycled) products relies upon the availability of standards and testing methods. There is a clear need to develop (and validate) methods, e.g. for the control of treatment processes or for the characterization of the end-products in view of their use in landfill, concrete, construction materials, etc. In this respect, the collaboration between industry and research organisations should be strengthened. In order to stimulate partnership between industry and research for the identification of possible actions to be undertaken in the field of standards, measurements andtesting for solid waste management, the SM&T programme of the European Commission organised a workshop. This paper summarises the round-table discussions and expert recommendations, as well as an outline of the programme of the workshop which was held in Pau (France), 5-7 May 1997.

As a result, various polymer-based admixtures have been developed, and polymer-modified mortar and concrete using them are currently popular construction materials because of their good cost-performance balance.

Effects of absorptance of external surfaces on heating and cooling loads of residential buildings in Jordan,solar radiation; building color; heating and cooling load; energy conservation; passive heating and cooling,,"Using the TRNSYS simulation program, the effect of the absorptance of external surfaces of buildings on heating, cooling and total loads has been studied. The meteorological data used in this study are for Amman and Aqaba, representing mild and hot climates, respectively, in Jordan. Two types of construction materials, namely, light weight concrete block and heavy weight concrete were used in the simulation. The effects of the absorptance on energy loads for insulated buildings were also calculated. The results show that, for not insulated buildings, as the absorptance was changed from one to zero, the total energy load decreases by 32%, while for insulated buildings, it decreases by 26% in Amman, whereas this decrease was about 47% for not insulated and 32% for insulated buildings in Aqaba.

Construction use of abandoned soils,abandoned soils; compressive strength; construction,,"Taiwan is a county under rapid development. Excavation in thousands of construction sites generated a huge amount of soils. In many cases, the soils are disposed randomly such that they are termed abandoned soils. A comprehensive study was conducted to investigate for reuse options of these soils: sub-grade construction, cement block production, structural concrete production, and asphalt concrete production. Five soils, representing predominant soil types in Taiwan were selected in this study. The compaction test results demonstrated that all five soils were suitable for subgrade construction. The compression tests for cement mortar showed that all soils produced mixes with strengths higher then 3.45 MPa and may be used to make cement blocks. The compressive strength test results of soil concrete samples showed that all soils except for the mix having 100% of soil No. 5 produced strengths higher than 17.25 MPa. The wet/dry durability test showed that the pozzolanic action of the soil concrete samples continued beyond 28 days and there seemed to be no detrimental effects. A comprehensive mix design was performed for each soil type and also developed a control mixture to test the use of abandoned soils in hot mix asphalt concrete. The study demonstrated that with proper design even clayey soils can be used to produce construction materials. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",1998

It was applied for the first time in the world to the construction of a 26-story reinforced concrete condominium project in Chiba Prefecture in 1995. This system incorporates four major elements: 1) a synchronously climbing all-weather temporary roof; 2) a parallel material delivery system; 3) prefabrication & unification of construction materials; and 4) a material management system.

Timber road bridges in Japan and their structural characteristics,,,"The authors first introduce the present status of modem timber bridge in Japan that it is gradually popularised, though there are not so many road bridges constructed until row. Then the authors show, by referring to the field test data of several existing bridges, that their dynamic properties fall in the same category as those of steel and concrete. Since the dynamic behaviour of structure well indicates their characteristics as a whole, the authors would like to conclude the wood is essentially comparable to steel or concrete as an alternative of bridge construction materials.",1998
Corrosion distress in concrete - Causes and protection,,,"The problem of deterioration of concrete, the most widely used construction material, is of special interest in tropical countries like India, where temperature fluctuations exceed 20 degrees C and humidity fluctuations of nearly 50 percent are not uncommon. The hot and humid coastal environments of the tropics are particularly conducive to corrosion of reinforcement in RCC resulting in spalling of concrete: Also, the intrusion of water, salts, chlorides, chemicals, fertilizers etc.in concrete causes premature cracking and spalling. In this paper causes of deterioration of concrete, trends and requirements for distress in concrete due to corrosion of reinforcement and urea attack and the suitable protective system are discussed in brief. The epoxy-phenolic IPN based treatments developed at CBRI has been highlighted. A case study giving die urea attack on concrete in a fertilizer plant structures with recommendations have been discussed.",1998
Heat of neutralization test to determine cement content of soil-cement or roller-compacted concrete,soil-cement; roller-compacted concrete (RCC); heat of neutralization; cement content; construction control; field test method,,A construction control field test method for determining the cement content of freshly mixed soil-cement or roller-compacted concrete (RCC) is discussed. Typical Bureau of Reclamation practice is to establish the most economical mix design requiring the lowest possible cement content that meets both strength and durability specification criteria. Gradation characteristics of available borrow material can dictate mix designs having a significant percentage of plus 4.75-mm (No. 4) sieve-size particles. The ability to determine quickly and accurately the cement content of soil-cement or RCC as it is being placed is critical to help ensure that specification strength and durability requirements are being met. The heat of neutralization test method presented (as modified by the Bureau of Reclamation) has been found to be accurate to within +/- I % of actual cement content for mix designs having cement contents of 3 to 16 % and up to 50 % plus 4.75-mm (No. 4) sieve-size particles; does not require the separation of plus 4.75-mm (No. 4) sieve-size material; and cement content determinations can be made using durable field equipment within 15 to 20 min. Precision and bias statements have been established for the test method in accordance with the ASTM Practice for Conducting an Interlaboratory Test Program to Determine the Precision of Test Methods for Construction Materials (C 802) and the ASTM Practice for Preparing Precision and Bias Statements for Test Methods for Construction Materials (C 670) and are presented.,1998
Reuse of stabilized waste as construction materials,,,"This study aimed to asses the feasibility of concrete production using stabilized waste as an addition to natural aggregates. Two inorganic waste streams were considered: foundry residues and fly ashes from municipal solid waste incineration. They were treated by means of a commercial cement-based stabilization/solidification process (using cement, lime and sodium silicate). After several days of curing, they were dried, milled, and sieved before being used as fine aggregate for concrete production. Produced concrete was then subjected to conventional physical-mechanical testing procedures (compression, traction, flexure, modulus of elasticity, shrinkage). In samples containing 200 kg waste/m(3) concrete, a very high compressive strength was achieved after 28 days curing time. Besides, leaching behavior of the concrete was evaluated, by means of different kinds of leaching tests. Experimental results showed a remarkable reduction of metal leaching of concrete with respect to stabilized waste. In some case (foundry residues), the same behavior was observed in ""natural"" concrete (produced with natural aggregates) and ""waste containing"" concrete.",1998
Radiation doses in Jordanian dwellings due to natural radioactivity in construction materials and soil,,BUILDING-MATERIALS,"The annual effective dose rates due to naturally occurring radioactivity in soil and materials used in construction of dwellings in Jordan have been calculated. A computer code INGRE based on the volume integral over the source shape method with its pre-processor and newly added isotope libraries has been used for this purpose. Experimentally measured gamma ray activities due to Ra-226, Th-232 and K-40 in soil and construction materials have been used. The annual effective dose rates to various organs or human tissues have been calculated. Our results show that the annual effective dose rates to all body organs or human tissues are smallest in concrete block houses and greatest in stone houses. In all three types of dwellings, the annual effective dose rates to all body organs or human tissues are smaller than those estimated by UNSCEAR for normal background area.

Microbially influenced degradation of concrete structures,concrete; degradation; microorganisms; sulfur dioxide; sulfite; microbiological; bridges,,"Steel reinforced concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. The economic costs of repair or replacement of environmentally damaged concrete structures is astronomical. For example, half of the concrete bridges in the Federal Department of Transportation highway system are in need of major repairs. Microbially Influenced Degradation of concrete (MID) is one of the recognized degradative processes known to adversely affect concrete integrity. It is not possible to assign a specific percent of effect to any of these processes. However, MID has been shown to be as aggressive as any of the physical/chemical phenomena. In addition, the possibility exists that there is a synergism which results in cumulative effects from all the processes. Three groups of bacteria are known to promote MID. Of these, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) are the most aggressive. Much is known about the nutritional needs of these bacteria. However, there has not been a biological linkage established between the presence of environmental, polluting sulfur sources and the degradation of concrete structures. It has been shown that the environmental pollutants sulfur dioxide and sulfite can be utilized by active SOB for the biological production of sulfuric acid. Therefore, it is not a reach of reality to assume that SOB exposed to these pollutants could have a major impact on the degradation of concrete structures. But, until the environment sulfur loop is closed it will not be possible to calculate how important SOB activity is in initiating and promoting damage.",1998
Sulfur concrete: A viable alternative for lunar construction,,,"The development of permanent lunar bases is constrained by the performance of construction materials and availability of in-situ resources. Concrete seems a suitable construction material for the lunar environment, but water, one of its major components, is an extremely scarce resource on the Moon. Cement would eventually have to be manufactured in situ through high-temperature processing of the lunar regolith. A possible alternative is to replace the binding mix of concrete (cement and water) with sulfur, the most abundant volatile on the lunar surface. Sulfur can be extracted from lunar soils by heating, demanding only moderate temperatures; it is also a by-product of oxygen extraction reactions. The economic viability and properties of sulfur-based concrete make it a suitable material for the first lunar construction activities, with a wide range of applications. The possible use of sulfur concrete imposes new constraints to the first base site selection.",1998
Issues in the numerical simulation of strain-rate and pressure sensitive cementitious granular materials,,,"Because cementitious, granular, pressure-sensitive materials constitute a wide range of construction materials like, concrete, soils and rocks, a project of investigation has been undertaken for the purpose of identifying the micromechanical mechanisms leading to the development and propagation of damage in these materials. One of the major goals of the investigation has been the development and the Finite Elements implementation of a triaxial, strain-rate sensitive, history and temperature dependent constitutive model. The model is under continuing development as additional material test results become available. In its present form it has been implemented in CAPA-3D, a massively parallel, nonlinear, static/dynamic Finite Elements system for the solution of very large-scale 3-D solid models.",1998
Lightweight thin walled Profiled Steel Sheeting/DryBoard (PSSDB) composite floor system,Profiled Steel Sheet; Dryboard; composite; lightweight,CONSTRUCTION,"This paper describes an innovative lightweight thin walled composite construction system, known as the ""Profiled Steel Sheet Dry Board (PSSDB) System"" developed by the authors over several years of research work. The composite panel system consists of dry boarding, such as chip, ply, or cement board, attached to a core of profiled steel sheeting using mechanical screws. Floors in buildings or small bridges are possible applications for the PSSDB system and can now be built within a shorter period of time compared to the traditional methods and materials of construction. Apart from the speed of construction and earlier occupation time of buildings, and no wastage of temporary construction materials, the PSSDB system also appeals to many clients as the panels are lightweight (approximately a quarter of the weight of normal reinforced concrete slabs) with a reduced construction depth, meaning a reduction in the floor to floor height in buildings. The PSSDB system may also be used as load bearing wall panels, and as folded plate roof structure. This paper highlights on the Bondek II/Cemboard Floor Panel (BCCFP), a derivative of the PSSDB system that has won three gold medals, i.e. the best overall invention award by the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), beating 58 other participants in the Invention & Design Competition (MINDEX\INNOTEX '97), held in Kuala Lumpur in 1997, a gold medal from the Ministry of Science, Technology and Environment, Malaysia in the same exhibition, and another gold medal received during the 26(th) Geneva International Exhibition on Invention, 1998.

Utilization of oil-contaminated sands in asphalt concrete for secondary roads,,,"The oil well sabotage during the Iraqi occupation and following the Iraqi withdrawal contaminated the Kuwaiti desert with crude oil covering millions of square meters. Thus, the desert has a huge amount of oil-contaminated sand that must be cleaned up or treated in order to restore it to its natural beauty. The oil-contaminated sand was utilized to mix asphalt concrete in the laboratory to determine the feasibility of using sand contaminated with oil as feed stock in the production of asphalt construction materials. The products developed in experimental testing did meet international standards. The mixes were asphalt concrete of a quality that can be used for secondary roads, road beds, road subbases, impermeable layers for landfill and containment facilities, or as stabilizers for steep embankments. Gases emitted during the production of asphalt concrete utilizing oil-polluted sands are considered environmentally acceptable.

Micromechanical tensile behavior of Slurry Infiltrated continuous-Fiber-Mat Reinforced Concrete (SIMCON),energy methods; fiber reinforced concrete; high-performance construction materials; metal fibers; micromechanical modeling; slurries; tensile stress-strain relationship,POLY(VINYL ALCOHOL); CEMENT INTERFACES; FAILURE; SLIP,"This paper describes the micromechanical tensile behavior of a new High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (HPFRC) called Slurry lnfiltrated Mar Concrete (SIMCON). SIMCON is made by first placing continuous Stainless steel fiber-mats into the form and then infiltrating the dense fiber network with a cement-based slurry. Due to lire very high fiber aspect ratio, SIMCON exhibits a high increase in strength, roughness, and crack control, reaching tensile strengths of lip to 17 MPa at strains of up to 1.5 percent with only 5.29 percent fiber volume fraction. Furthermore, since fiber-mats are easy to handle, as compared to short discontinuous fibers SIMCON has no major construction-related shortcomings. It is therefore well-suited for repair retrofit, and new construction of earthquake resistant buildings, bridges, and other structures that require high strength and ductility. However; to achieve optimal performance it is necessary to properly ""engineer"" the composite. In other words, a full understanding of the effect of different different micromechanical parameters (e.g., fracture surface energy, spe cific work of the interfacial fracture, etc.) on the overall composite behavior is important for reaching anticipated performance. Once this relationship has been determined, desired composite behavior call be ""engineered"" by varying the amount and type of its constituents. The relationship between basic micromechanical parameters and tensile behavior of SIMCON is established in this paper using an energy approach. Theoretically derived values are compared to the experimentally obtained data.",1997
Flexural behavior of composite R.C.-slurry infiltrated mat concrete (SIMCON) members,composite beams; experimental investigation; fiber reinforced concrete; flexural retrofit; high performance construction materials; metal fibers; non-linear analytical procedure; reinforced concrete; slurries,BEAMS,"This paper explores the structural use of a new High-Performance Fiber Reinforced Concrete (HPFRC) called Slurry infiltrated Mat Concrete (SIMCON) and presents the effect of using this material on flexural strength and energy absorption of composite members. SIMCON is made by first placing continuous stainless steel fiber-mats into the form followed by infiltration of the dense fiber network with a cement-based slurry. These mats are ''pre-woven'' and delivered to the site in large rolls. The mats need only to be ''unfurled'' into the formwork, thus substantially simplifying the manufacturing process, as compared to reinforced concrete. The advantages of SIMCON, namely high strength, high toughness; excellent crack control, and good constructability, make it well suited for development of high-performance infrastructural systems. The paper describes the flexural behavior of composite SIMCON members, and provides a non-linear analysis procedure capable of accurately predicting the moment-curvature behavior of these members; Due to its fibermat configuration, SIMCON is well suited for (a) structural repair/retrofit by wrapping around existing structural members, and (b) new construction as stay-in-place formwork SIMCON use in repair/retrofit was evaluated experimentally by testing three different repair/retrofit layouts: on the beam top, at the beam bottom and on three beam sides (bottom and two side faces). An analytical valuation procedure was developed and then used to investigate the performance of new composite members. The use of SIMCON increased strength energy absorption capacities, durability, and allowed for optimization of member weight and height.",1997
A strain-rate-dependent concrete material model for ADINA,,NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; DYNAMIC FRACTURE; TESTS; STRENGTH,"The analysis, design and/or evaluation of protective structures and facilities for military use demands the accurate determination of material and structural response to high-intensity, short-duration impulse loadings. There currently exists a preponderance of data supporting increased strength characteristics in concrete, the primary construction material for protective facilities, at high strain rates. This paper summarizes the modification of the nonlinear concrete material model currently employed in the ADINA finite-element computer programs to account for high strain rate effects.

Response of MICROTOX organisms to leachates of autoclaved cellular concrete,,,"The MICROTOX bioassay, a toxicity test involving bioluminescent microorganisms, was conducted on aqueous leachates derived from a construction material made using coal fly ash as the key siliceous ingredient. The material is known as autoclaved cellular concrete (ACC). The test indicated an absence of toxic effects attributable to soluble species, which included the priority heavy metals in the filtered leachates. Toxic or inhibitive effects on the test bacteria were observed for the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) leachates, but this was probably due to acetic acid in the extractant rather than the solubilized metals. The ASTM (distilled-deionized water extractant) and simulated acid rain leachates, by comparison, produced a repeatable stimulative effect. Stimulation observed in the form of enhanced light ouput may be a manifestation of hormesis, a phenomenon reportedly caused by exposure to extremely low concentrations (part-per-billion range) of otherwise toxic agents such as heavy metals.",1997
Leachate and radon production from fly ash autoclaved cellular concrete,,,"Environmental consequences and potential Liabilities of autoclaved cellular concrete (ACC) use were assessed by aqueous leaching of crushed samples for metals and organic solvent extractions of solid ACC for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Also, whole ACC blocks were tested for radon exhalation potential. Results show leachate concentrations were typically 10 times below, and always 100 times below the regulatory threshold of applicable drinking water standards. A Microtox bioassay procedure showed no toxic effects due to leached metals. Organic analysis of solvent extracts indicated no release of hazardous PAHs attributable to the By ash ingredient of ACC. Measured rates of radon exhalation were too low to cause potentially dangerous buildups in confined air spaces. Fly ash ACC may be characterized as an environmentally ''green'' construction material based on these findings.",1997
Materials for the repair and protection of concrete,concrete; repair; materials,,"When the deterioration processes have taken their toll and the deterioration mechanisms have been identified, appropriate materials will need to be selected for the repair work. Traditionally, the selection of materials has been based on data supplied from the manufacturers or suppliers, who have provided test results for properties thought to be the most relevant. Driven from an understanding of the raw materials, rather than necessarily the engineering principles, data were sometimes inadequate in key areas such as elastic modulus, shrinkage and creep of repair mortars. An improvement was the development of British Board of Agrement testing regimes for repair systems, but the certification is at national level and is not universally accepted, for example by other European Union member states. With the drive towards CE marking of products before they are permitted to be sold in the European Union, unification of test methods is required for all construction materials. For repair products, agreement is being reached, albeit slowly, on the methods of test necessary for identification and performance, and the values necessary for the satisfactory behaviour of the product in a repair situation. Keeping abreast of these changes is important, providing relevant comment to the BSI committee representatives who volunteer to present the UK position to CEN. This paper describes the current developments towards a unified Standard for repair mortars. The authors would welcome any comments from conference delegates on the test methods under consideration and the performance limits that are being proposed.

Technology for chemical-metallurgical coal ash utilization,,ACID-LEACHING ROUTES; FIRED POWER-PLANTS; ALUMINA RECOVERY; FEED MATERIALS; FLUIDIZED-BED; FLY-ASH; SPOILS; EXTRACTION; COMBUSTION; IRON,"Coal is a major contributor to power and heat generation in the United States. According to economic forecasts coal mining and consumption as fuel will increase through 2010. Simultaneously, deposits of ash from coal combustion are expected to accumulate extensively. Today, about quarter of coal combustion solid waste is used for cement and concrete production. Many millions of tons of aluminum and silicon contained in the coal wastes are annually lost in landfills. Use of coal ash as a raw material for production of chemicals and construction materials can significantly fulfill the U.S. need for these commodities while at the same time decrease dusty pollution. A fairly large number of processes for recovering alumina and byproducts from coal ash have been proposed and developed. These processes are classified by methods of ash decomposition into sintering and hydrothermal technologies and by extractant type into alkaline and acidic groups. On the basis of the available calculations, preference should be given to a combined process including the alkaline pre-extraction of silicon followed by lime-soda sintering of desilicated solid remainder. This review covers 98 papers, patents, and reports issued over the last 30 years. U.S. chemical and metallurgical industries are expected to resume growing through the end of the decade, and coal ash should be recognized as a practicable domestic raw material which can be utilized in a number of ways.",1997

The data are also useful in estimation of skin friction for piles driven through lightweight aggregate fills.",1997
Analytical modelling of the dielectric properties of concrete for subsurface radar applications,concrete; radar; dielectric properties; defects,PARTIALLY SATURATED ROCKS,"Subsurface radar is being used increasingly during the investigation and appraisal of a wide range of existing buildings and structures. The technique has been used regularly to obtain details of construction details features and defects. The use of radar to estimate the moisture content and porosity of construction materials poses a severe test of the method. This is potentially possible as the three major components which make up these materials (i.e. material solids, saline water and entrained air have very different dielectric properties). To identify these parameters by the (radar) measurement of the effective dielectric properties of the material requires the solution of an 'inversion problem'. This paper focuses on the effect of water content and the geometrical variation of pore shape upon the effective dielectric properties of concrete. These issues are dealt with by the development of forward dielectric models in which the effective dielectric properties of heterogeneous construction materials are estimated from the (known) properties of the constituents.

Recycling of resin matrix composite materials .7. Future perspective of FRP recycling,FRP; material recycling; recycle; aggregates; construction materials,,"Resin matrix composites reinforced by glass fibers and carbon fibers (FRPs) are used extensively for many industrial applications, such as construction materials, automobiles, ships and sporting goods, because of their high strength, ease of molding, light weight, durability, and resistance to corrosion, shock and abrasion. However, despite its many superior properties, it is difficult to resource and recycle FRP after its disposition. In this report, the recycling technology of FRP that has been developed is introduced as well as an outline of new recycling technology of FRP developed by the authors. FRP fine powders are made from waste FTP moldings using a fine powder crusher. The average grain size of these fine powders is 15-20 mu m. FRP fine powder was examined as a possible additive to paints and it was found that it increased the tensile strength of the paints. FRP can also be recycled as filler for FRP resin. FRPs were also examined for possible civil and construction materials and they were found to be useful as aggregates for concrete secondary products. After examining these manufacturing conditions in detail, by fabricating light and high-strength mortars and investigating strength prediction and water solubility after extended time, it was found to be a practical material. Burned ashes from FRP showed superior properties as mortar concrete expansive admixtures. It was concluded that FRPs, which used to be hard-to-destroy and hard-to-recycle materials, can be recycled for many industrial materials after crushing into fine powders.",1997
Future research trends in high-performance concrete - Cost-effective considerations,,,"High-performance concrete (HPC) prepared on the basis of eugenic considerations (cost-effectiveness and life-cycle length) is proposed to resolve actual concrete problems. HPC is safe, durable, workable, economical, and ecologically sound. Concrete in Taiwan is always designed with large amounts of water and paste (even though it is generally accepted that the concrete will tend to crack and deteriorate). Therefore, HPC with fewer problems is the target of ongoing research. Eugenic HPC is produced from ordinary concrete, super plasticized concrete, pozzolanic concrete, and high-flowing concrete. Without the drawbacks of past forms of concrete, eugenic HPC is a better construction material on the basis of individual material characteristics. The characteristics of eugenic HPC are presented and illustrated by two high-rise buildings in Taiwan constructed with high-flowing HPC.",1997
Comparative experiments on various adfreeze bond strength tests between ice and materials,,,"This paper summarizes systematic experiments on the adfreeze bond strength between sea ice and construction materials used for offshore structures, such as steel and concrete, as well as various coating materials. As a result of comparing test methods to determine the adfreeze bond strength between ice and the materials of structures, very little difference was observed among these methods. We also confirmed that the adfreeze bond strength depends more on the coarseness of the surface of construction materials than on the free surface energy on the surface.",1997
Environment protection by industrial wastes utilization for engineering geology goals,,,"The paper is devoted to the development of new construction materials from different types of industrial wastes(all types of ferrous and some kinds of nonferrous dump slags, incinerator's and heat power station ash and slag, slime of chemical purification, burnt coal mining and stone cutting refuses: burnt foundry sand and slag, etc.)in combination with liquid or sludge wastes of the same processes as binding materials. Liquid powdered or sludge wastes of various plants (chemical, petrochemical, machine engineering, metallurgical, textile, varnish and dyes, etc.) were used as activator of chemical interaction of tile mixtures. These materials are used for binding of almost all of the types of natural soils. New materials works like poor concrete and has numerous advantages in comparison with natural traditional inert materials (sand,gravel, broken rock, etc.)in strength, elasticity, construction rate, long service, cost-price, environment protection, etc. All the hazardous elements of wastes are chemically binded in nonsoluble compositions and were tested in acid, alkaline and neutral solutions. Some types of industrial wastes were used as binding materials for natural soils stabilization. Ten roads and one military airfield were constructed 5-6 fold cheaper in rigorous climate conditions, including the Russian North and Siberia and during 17 years of exploitation they shows high performance. Except the materials can be used for construction of dams, different foundations, etc.",1997
The role of renewable resources in the global raw materials picture,,,"At the same time that the world is experiencing rapid growth in human populations, rapid economic growth in many parts of the world is serving to dramatically increase per-capita demand for many basic raw materials. Taken together, the result is a marked increase in global consumption of raw materials of all kinds. While properly referred to as nonrenewables, metallic ores and cementitious materials are, nonetheless, abundant, such that the world is unlikely to run out of the vast majority of these materials anytime in the foreseeable future. A significant question mark regarding the future of nonrenewable materials is whether energy will continue to be abundant and inexpensive. If so, then highly energy-intensive materials such as aluminum, steel, and concrete are likely to maintain or even increase their relative importance in the global raw materials picture. On the other hand, if energy availability becomes a constraint, either because of supply issues or environmental concerns, then renewable materials are likely to become relatively more important than today. Wood is a renewable material, and a principal raw material in the world today. However, growing concerns worldwide about the sustainability of forestry practices raises the question of whether wood will continue to play a key role in the global raw materials picture in the future. A related question is whether agriculturally derived fiber will prove to be a viable substitute for wood and/or a significant raw material, either as a wood supplement or in its own right, for use in producing structural and nonstructural construction materials and other products. In the author's opinion, the answers to both questions are ""probably,"" although it is not a given that wood will maintain its current importance as a basic raw material.",1997
Evaluation of water trap designs and alternative mine seal construction materials,,,"The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Center (PRC) and the U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) are participating in a research program to evaluate the effectiveness of: water trap and seal designs for use in underground coal mines. This program is being conducted at PRC's Lake Lynn Laboratory. Typical water trap pipes of 15 and 30 cm diameter and a water trough design were evaluated under explosion conditions. Each of these water trap designs was shown to be inadequate in preventing the passage of the explosion flame through the trap design and/or in maintaining the water level within the trap so as to continue its intended function. Successful results were obtained through simple modifications to these water trap designs. Additional coal mine seal designs were evaluated for strength characteristics and air-leakage resistance following full-scale mine explosions. A seal constructed with a 40-cm-thick polymer (polyurethane) and aggregate core between two dry-stacked, concrete block walls withstood the required 138 kPa explosion pressure pulse while maintaining acceptable air-leakage rates. Similar seal designs utilizing a 97-cm-thick 91 kg/m(3) density polymer-only core did not survive the explosion; however, a 51-cm-thick 203 kg/m(3) density polymer-only core seal did. A cellular concrete construction material was also shown to be a successful seal design material.",1997
Embedded and surface mounted fiber optic sensors for civil structural monitoring,deformation sensor; strain sensor; structural monitoring; fiber optic sensors,,"Civil structural monitoring by optical fiber sensors, requires the development of reliable sensors that can be embedded or surface mounted in concrete, mortars, steel, timber and other construction materials as well as in rocks, roils and road pavements. These sensors should be rapid and simple to install in order to avoid any interference with the building site schedule and not to require specialized operators to accomplish the task. The sensors have to be rugged enough to withstand the harsh conditions typically found in civil engineering including, dust, moisture, shocks, EM disturbances and unskilled workman. It is also desirable that the instrumentation survives for tens of years in order to allow a constant monitoring of the structure aging. This contribution presents the results of a four-year effort to develop, test and industrially produce a palette of sensors responding to the above requirements and adapted to different applications and host materials. These sensors include a small version (length up to 2 m) adapted for embedding in mortars, grout and glues, an intermediate version of length between 20 cm and 6 m adapted to direct concrete embedding or surface installation and a long version adapted to measure large deformations (up to 2%) over length up to 30 m and especially adapted for geostructures monitoring.",1997
High power diode laser marking and engraving of building materials,diode laser; semiconductor laser; building material; construction material; marking; engraving; granite; marble; brick; concrete; tile; near infrared wavelength,,"A Diomed 60W-cw high power diode laser (HPDL) has been used for the marking and engraving of various building materials, including; marble, granite, clay tiles, ceramic tiles, roof tiles, ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and clay bricks, Morphological and microstructural characteristics have been investigated. The basic mechanisms of marking/engraving and the characteristics of the beam absorption are discussed. The effects of material texture, colour and laser processing parameters are reported. The work shows that engraving depths of over 2mm (0.75mm for a single pass) can be achieved on marble substrates by thermal disintegration of CaCO3 into loose CaO powder and CO2 gas. Uniform amorphous glazed lines (1-3mm line width) of a colour different from the untreated materials can be generated on clay tiles, ceramic tiles, roof tiles, clay bricks and OPC by solidification phase formation after laser melting of these materials. Effects of atmospheric conditions, for instance using O-2 and Ar gas shrouds, have been examined, viith different coloured marks being observed when different shroud gases are used. To demonstrate the practical worth of the process a UMIST crest has been marked on a ceramic tile using the system. Laser beam reflectivity is found to depend not only on material composition but also its colour, Reflectivity has Seen found to range between 12% to 18% for the various construction materials used in the experiment, except for marble (grey) which showed over 27% reflectivity. Since the HPDL is a portable device, on-site application of these processing techniques can be realised, which would be either impossible or difficult when using other types of lasers.",1997
Indoor radon concentrations in the town of Podgorica-Montenegro,indoor radon levels; types of houses; cellulose nitrate detectors,,"Indoor radon survey in the town of Podgorica, capital of Montenegro, was performed in winter season 1994-95. The town houses were classified on the basis of their construction materials and techniques in 4 distinct types. Radon was measured in 110 dwellings, selected with respect to the types and locations of houses. Measurements were carried out by cellulose nitrate track detectors, exposed for 90 days in living-rooms on ground floors. Equilibrium equivalent concentrations of radon are found to be in (4 - 453) Bq/m(3) range, with a median of 26.4 Bq/m(3). They belong to a log-normal distribution (geometric mean: 21.8 Bq/m(3), geometric standard deviation: 2.20 Bq/m(3)). The detached houses built of bricks have the highest average indoor radon level, and the apartment houses made of concrete and bricks, with plaster on the walls, the lowest one.",1997
Life cycle management of concrete structures,,,"In the present paper, current experience with performance and serviceability of concrete structures is briefly outlined and discussed. Although deteriorating processes such as freezing and thawing and expansive alkali reactions also may present some problems, it is not the disintegration of the concrete itself, but rather electrochemical corrosion of embedded steel which poses the most critical and greatest threat to the performance and serviceability of many concrete structures. In a chloride containing environment, it appears to be a question of time before detrimental amounts of chlorides will reach embedded steel, even through a thick cover of high-qualify concrete. Thus, in many countries, an increasing amount of premature steel corrosion has created a serious problem. On the basis of current experience, it should be accepted that also structural concrete is a construction material that needs a certain amount of preventive maintenance. As a consequence, appropriate programs for life cycle management should be applied, in which the concrete structures are subjected to periodical surveying of structural condition as a basis for the preventive maintenance.",1997
Abrasion resistant active braze alloys for metal single layer technology,,SIC PARTICULATE COMPOSITES; SLIDING WEAR BEHAVIOR; INTERFACIAL REACTIONS; ALUMINUM; STRENGTH,"The technology of brazing a single layer of abrasive on to the surface of a grinding tool, metal single layer (MSL) technology, provides an alternative way to make use of the superabrasives diamond and cubic boron nitride in machining ceramic materials of superalloys, cutting of construction materials, etc. For certain applications of MSL bonded wheels, the grinding or cutting process is very abrasive and the wear resistance of the braze alloy often dominates the wheel failure. The wear resistance of the braze alloy typically used for MSL can be improved by incorporating hard dispersoids. The present study examines the effect of particulate molybdenum, tungsten, SiC, WC, and TiC dispersoids on the wear resistance of Cu-Sn-Ti active braze alloys. Among these, TiC was identified as most effective in enhancing the abrasive resistance of the braze alloy. It was found that a braze alloy of 75Cu-25Sn-12.5Ti-7.5Zr-10TiC-0.2C (by weight) exhibits high wear and resistance and excellent performance in cutting tests on green concrete.

The structural use of rubber - The case of rubber dams,,,"The use of rubber as a structural material in civil engineering has yet to be established: most of the civil engineering structures constructed are made of steel, concrete, soil and rock. There are a multitude of reasons for this and one of them is the problem of durability: natural rubber is prone to atmospheric degradation. Nevertheless, rubber has been used successfully with conventional construction materials and one such applications is found in Hong Rang. The Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD), Hang Kong Government, are using rubber dams for the replacement of worn-out irrigation dams. The major reason why rubber dams are used is that the dams can help mitigate flooding. In the inflated mode, it is serving the function of an irrigation dam; when is deflated, it functions as a flood mitigation device. As Hong Kong is located in a sub-tropical region, rivers can become very violent during severe rainstorms and flooding occurs in low-lying areas from time to time. The ease of deflation of the rubber dams is of great value in flood mitigation. The success in the use of the dams has encouraged more applications in Hong Kong. The merits and some of the problems associated with the dams are discussed.",1997
A floating concrete platform hull made of lightweight aggregate concrete,concrete hull; offshore lightweight concrete; tension leg platform,,"By the start of the construction of the Heidrun platform in the spring of 1993 two important milestones had been passed: (1) construction of the first concrete floater; (2) application of LWA concrete as a structural material for an offshore platform, Concrete has been found to be a favourable construction material for hulls for floating oil production platforms, Lightweight aggregate concrete has been developed and found to be well suited for this purpose, The hydrodynamic properties of the platform can be optimized by proper weight distribution achieved by a feasible combination of normal density and lightweight concrete of different qualities and unit weights.

Phosphogypsum slag aggregate-based asphaltic concrete mixes,,,"Phosphogypsum is a by-product from the production of phosphoric acid used in the fertilizer and chemical industries. Large production rates and problems associated with its stockpiling have led researchers to seek alternative uses for phosphogypsum, primarily as a construction material. One such use is the extraction of sulfur dioxide for the production of sulfuric acid, a process that also generates a by-product slag aggregate. This study investigated the feasibility of using this slag aggregate in asphaltic concrete binder course mixes. The physical properties of the slag aggregate, such as gradation, specific gravity, absorption, unit weight, and void content, were determined, as well as its durability and environmental characteristics. The Marshall mix design method was used to obtain the optimum asphalt content for this aggregate, while moisture susceptibility was examined using the boiling and modified Lottman tests. Indirect tensile, resilient modulus, and dynamic creep tests were performed on the mix to evaluate its performance potential. The results of the study indicate that phosphogypsum-based slag aggregate can be successfully employed in asphaltic concrete binder course mixtures.",1996
Geomembrane application for an RCC dam,,,"This paper focuses on a fairly unique application of a geosynthetic material for a reservoir impoundment dam. Use of a geosynthetic material to enhance the 'impervious' nature of the design was not without its attendant difficulties during installation. As with any unique application by end users not familiar with a particular construction material's physical characteristics or installation requirements, problems arise causing construction delays while executing corrective actions. This paper presents some of the problems encountered that are particularly note-worthy in this unique application of geosynthetic materials. This particular design utilizes a very low cement content, porous, roller compacted concrete selected as the most practical and economical design based on local material availability and/or cost of alternative construction materials. The project, which is still under construction as of this publication, consists of approximately 74,220 m(3) (97,000 yd(3)) of roller compacted concrete along with approximately 6420 m(2) (69,100 ft(2)) geomembrane. Due to the very low cement content, approximately 1.7% by weight, the concrete portion of the dam is very porous requiring enhancement. To provide this, the design incorporated a geomembrane as an 'impervious' barrier. The geomembrane component is 'sandwiched' between the upstream pre-cast facade and the downstream concrete emplacement. In order to address developing construction difficulties and to ensure the integrity of the geomembrane installation, a formal CQA plan was developed to identify the causes of the geomembrane installation difficulties and to implement a plan to facilitate the material installation and ensure it's integrity.

Diffusion of radionuclides in concrete and concrete-bentonite systems,,,"Various construction materials are under consideration for nuclear waste repositories. Two important materials are concrete and bentonite clay, which will act as mechanical barriers and prevent convective water flow. These barriers will also retard transport (diffusion controlled) of dissolved radionuclides by a combination of mechanical constraints and chemical interactions with the solid. An important issue is the possible change of the initial sodium bentonite into the calcium form due to interaction with calcium from the concrete. The initial leaching of concrete was studied using radioactive spiked concrete in contact with compacted bentonite. Measurement were made of the diffusion of Cs, Am and Pu into 5 different types of concrete in contact with pore water. The diffusivity measured for Cs agrees reasonably well with data found in the literature. No movement could be measured for Am and Pu (< 0.2 mm), even though the contact times were extremely long (2.5 and 5 yr, respectively). The diffusion of Na, Ca and Cs from concrete into bentonite was also measured.",1996
Use of remediated petroleum contaminated soils in highway construction,,,"Petroleum products from leaking underground storage tanks (USTs) contaminate soil and have the potential to contaminate groundwater. Removal and proper disposal of petroleum contaminated soils (PCSs) are legally required to prevent further contamination of groundwater. Excavated PCSs from leaking UST can be used in highway industry as construction materials. In this study, a base course of a two lane highway with heavy vehicular traffic was designed and constructed with 17,000 tons of hot mix asphalt concrete made with remediated petroleum contaminated soils. A design mix containing remediated PCSs was obtained and evaluated for suitability by testing the Marshall stability, durability and permeability. The performance of the highway pavement was evaluated immediately after construction and one year later using a heavy weight deflectometer. The heavy weight deflectometer results showed that the mechanical performance of HMA with remediated PCSs was comparable to that without PCSs. Both full-scale field and laboratory tests proved that remediated PCSs can be used in production and paving of hot mix asphalt concrete. On the basis of the test results presented herein, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) has modified the 1989 standard specification to include up to 20% remediated PCSs in bituminous stabilized base courses.",1996
Reuse of industrial wastes as potential liners in landfills,,,"Earthen liners have been widely used to contain waste materials in landfills. There is need for cost effective alternatives where clay is scarce. The potentiality of industrial wastes, such as fly ash, crushed waste concrete and clarifier waste sludge, as the althernative liners in landfills is investigated. A series of tests were performed on industrial wastes and admixtures to examine their compaction, compressive strength, hydraulic conductivity characterisitics and the compatibility with representative leachate within landfills. Results from the testing showed that adequate hydraulic conductivity lower than 10(-7) cm/sec can be achieved with sufficient stabilizer contents and curing. The findings suggest that admired fly ash, crushed waste concrete, and clarifier waste sludge could serve as an alternative to clay soil in liner construction materials.",1996
Testing of the masonry arches of the Brooklyn Bridge approaches,the Brooklyn Bridge; impact-echo testing; flatjack testing; nondestructive testing; masonry arches,,"Diagnostic procedures play an important role in performing a condition survey of a structure. Specialized tests are used during a field survey to supplement visual observations. The tests provide valuable information regarding the internal condition of the structure and quality of the construction materials. The tests also help in determining the extent of damage, if any. Recently, a team of consulting engineers performed a study to determine the remaining capacity of the Brooklyn Bridge approaches for the Department of Transportation, City of New York. Using advanced diagnostic procedures such as impact-echo and flatjack testing, additional information was gathered to assist in the study. Impact-echo testing was helpful in identifying the condition of the brick soffits which were covered with pneumatically-applied concrete, and flatjack testing was useful in determining in-situ compressive strength and compression modulus of the brick masonry. The paper describes the work and the testing results.",1996
Use of recycled plastic resins in infrastructure construction materials,plastics; recycling; highway materials; asphalt; concrete; economics; waste stream,,"City and State agencies are phased with the problem of disposing significant volume of waste materials. While in the past incineration and burial have been the common methods of disposing plastics, rubber, glass, ash and other products of the municipal waste stream (MSW), the environmental concerns, the increasing cost of landfills, and the recognition of the salvage value of these products promotes the drastic reduction of landfilled material. For example, the City of New York is planning to drastically increase the recycling waste from a 12% to 42% of MSW by the year 2000. The Infrastructure Construction Materials provide a significant market potential for recycling plastic resins. The infrastructure industry is being investigating the use of recycled plastic resins for improving material quality and durability for a long time. Today, there are several examples of construction materials and products containing recycled plastic resins, such as, pavement joint sealants, polymer modified asphalt and concrete, roofing materials, geotextiles, traffic cones, and other. This paper describes the research to practice cases known today in the infrastructure construction materials. Recycled plastic resins are routinely used for producing polymer modified highway and building materials and traffic control devices. On the other hand, in an attempt to address i) society's need for safe and economical disposal of discarded plastic resins, and ii) the infrastructure community's need for better, long lasting, and cost effective materials, significant research and effort is being made today for identifying new uses and applications with these resins. Several of these developments and uses are presented in this paper along with the identification of application requirements and needs.",1996
Enhancement of Portland cement concrete with tire rubber particles,Portland cement concrete; elastic properties; static and dynamic modulus; non-destructive testing; crumb rubber; waste materials,,"Over the last years significant emphasis is being placed on the use of recycled products in highway and construction materials. Today, more than 200 million passenger and track tires are being discarded every year. With the continuous restrictions on the acceptance of this material in landfills and the increasing environmental and safety concerns, there is a significant need for identifying new uses and applications for tire rubber. Rubber is being recycled to a limited degree for producing new tires. In addition, tires are being used as alternative fuel in kilns due to their high Btu content. In infrastructure constriction crumb rubber, produced from waste automobile tires, is being used extensively and successfully with asphalt mixtures. With these materials, rubber is being blended with binders, ''wet process'', for enhancing their reological properties, or used as an aggregate replacement, ''dry process.'' In Portland cement concrete, rubber from granulated tires may be used as an elastic fine or coarse aggregate modifying the brittle failure of concrete and increasing thus, its ability to absorb higher amount of energy before failure. This paper describes the results of an experimental study conducted for evaluating the effects of incorporating granulated rubber into Portland cement concrete. In this investigation, the effects of different rubber contents on Portland cement concrete properties were examined through destructive and nondestructive techniques. A comparison with conventional Portland cement concrete indicated that the use of rubber particles significantly improves the characteristics of concrete. Further analysis are currently being conducted for evaluating the long term performance of the rubber filled concrete.",1996
Quasi-elastic behavior of Rubber Included Concrete (RIC) using waste rubber tires,RIC; rubber; concrete; tires; quasi-elastic; toughness; ductility,,"Used tires pose a significant solid-waste management challenge, where only a small percentage of an existing stockpile of more than an estimated 2 billion are reused, while the rest are landfilled or illegally stockpiled. Stockpiles are dangerous, because they are fire hazards and breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The supply of waste tires may be transformed into a valuable resource with Rubber Included Concrete (RIC++). RIC is a construction material which includes mechanically ground rubber, and is suitable for many construction applications, with some desirable properties like increased toughness and ductility, less density, and more efficient heat and sound insulation.

Incinerator's ash and slag as a valuable construction material,,,"The author has developed materials and technologies of incinerator's ash and slag (IAS) in combination with other industrial wastes (all kinds of slags dumped by the iron and steel industry, liquid, sludge, and powdered wastes of chemical, textile, paint and varnish, petrochemical, engineering, iron and steel, and other industries). The materials have very high water and frost resistance. All of the ecologically burdensome components became chemically strong binded in insoluble compositions in acid, neutral and alkaline environments. The developed materials from these wastes can be used as lean concrete with unusual structures without binders like cement or lime. They can be used instead of sand, crushed stone, gravel, and all other traditional natural inert materials for the construction of bases of waste disposal sites, roads, airfields, darns etc. and other types of construction with a high economical efficiency.

Uk experience of plate bonding with advanced composite materials,,,"Composite materials have superior properties to existing construction materials with respect to strength, weight, durability, creep, fatigue and fire. The paper will address the opportunities for their application to bridges. Ongoing research into the use of reinforced polymer matrix composite materials as a replacement for steel plates which are bonded to the underside of concrete beams to strengthen bridges that have deteriorated or need to be upgraded to carry additional service requirements will be described. Progress is being made towards the development of practical design rules and guidelines for the technique. Finite element methods are being used to model the experimental data for calibration in the first instance and following this for predictive purposes. The additional advantage of advanced composites is that the plates can be prestressed before bonding providing a form of external prestressing. Beans with bonded prestressed plates have been tested in the laboratory. 18m long post-tensioned beams taken from the Botley Flyover, demolished due to corrosion of the prestressing tendons, will be strengthened by this method under site conditions. These will be tested as a practical proof of the technique.",1996
STRENGTH DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-STRENGTH CONCRETES WITH AND WITHOUT SILICA FUME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH HYDRATION TEMPERATURES,,,"High performance concretes of high compressive strength are finding increasing applications in many fields of construction such as core walls and columns in tall buildings, long-span bridges and marine structures. In thick cross-sections, the high binder contents of some high strength concretes can result in the development of high in-situ temperatures. The combined influence of limited moist curing and high hydration temperatures may significantly influence the progress of hydration. This can affect the long-term development of in-situ strength and other engineering properties. Knowledge of in-situ strength development under these conditions is needed to ensure safe utilisation of this new generation of construction materials. This paper presents results of an investigation on the strength development of high strength concretes with and without silica fume subjected to high in-situ temperature conditions. A temperature match conditioning (TMC) system was developed and used to simulate the semi-adiabatic temperature development within medium sized high strength concrete columns. The results of this investigation show that in-situ temperatures of up to 70 degrees C significantly increased the 7-day strength of a high strength silica fume concrete. Although no strength regression was observed up to 1 year, the silica fume concrete subjected to high early temperatures showed significantly lower strengths when compared to concrete cured at standard temperature. For the silica fume concrete subjected to high early temperatures, non-evaporable water contents suggest little additional hydration beyond 3 days.",1995
Plastic waste management in construction: Technological and institutional issues,waste management; recycled plastic; resin; polyester concrete,MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE,"The main objective of a solid waste management system is to effectively safeguard the public health, safety, and welfare. The various options involved in a waste management process are landfilling, incineration, and recycling wastes into useful products. Plastics recycling, in particular, would not be successful unless the proper infrastructure to collect the waste is being set, the technology to economically reprocess the waste into new products is available, and the establishment of markers for the cost-effective use of recycled products are developed. The development of new construction materials using recycled plastics is important to both the construction and the plastics recycling industries. Extensive research investigated the use of resins based on recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic waste for the production of a high performance composite material, namely polyester concrete (PC). Resins using recycled PET offer the possibility of a lower source cost of materials for forming good quality PC. PC products also allow the long-term disposal of PET waste, an important advantage in recycling applications.",1995
Nondestructive evaluation of polyester polymer concrete,damping; esters; impact resistance; modulus of elasticity; nondestructive tests; Poisson ratio; polymer concrete; ultrasonic tests,ECHO,"Nondestructive rests are becoming popular in rapidly evaluating the properties of construction materials. In this study, the applicability of the impact resonance method and the ultrasonic pulse velocity method to polyester. polymer (compressive strength of 110 MPa) and polymer concrete (compressive strength of 58 MPa) was investigated. The effect of specimen shape and size on the dynamic moduli, damping ratio, and pulse velocity were studied. The response of cylinders (length-to-diameter ratio 2 and 3) and prisms (length-to-width ratio 2.5 and 4.5) in the three fundamental modes of vibration, namely, longitudinal, transverse, and torsional, were investigated. From the longitudinal and transverse resonant frequencies, the dynamic Young's modulus of elasticity (E(d)) and damping ratio (D) were determined. Using the torsional, resonant frequency, the dynamic modulus of rigidity (G(d)) and dynamic Poisson's ratio (v(d)) were determined. Using the ultrasonic method, the pulse velocity in polymer (P) and polymer concrete (PC) was measured at frequencies of 50 and 150 kHz. The dynamic modulus of elasticity (E(p)) was also determined from the pulse velocity and compared to tile static modulus (E(s)). The dynamic modulus of elasticity for PC (E(d)(PC)) agreed well with the static modulus (E(s)(PC)) for all the shapes and sizes investigated. The average dynamic Poisson's ratio (v(d)(PC)) was 0.22, as compared to the static value (v(s)(PC)) of 0.20. The dynamic modulus of rigidity (G(d)(PC)) was independent of specimen shape. For polymer, the pulse velocity (V-p(P)) was independent of specimen size and testing frequency. The average pulse velocities of polymer and PC were 2450 and 3425 m/s, respectively. The modulus of elasticity (E(p)(PC)) was 10 percent higher than the static modulus (E(s)(PC)) for PC cylinders. The dynamic modulus (E(p)(PC))PC from pulse velocity measurements was as sensitive as the static modulus to changes in density and specimen size. The average during ratios of polymer and PC were 1.1 and 0.6 percent, respectively.",1995

DEVELOPMENT OF NO-FINES CONCRETE PAVEMENT APPLICATIONS,,,"No-fines concrete is a type of concrete from which the fine aggregate is totally omitted and single-sized coarse aggregates are held together by a binder consisting of a paste of hydraulic cement and water. The earliest application of no-fines concrete dates back to 1852 when two houses and a seagroin of 61 m (200 ft) long and 2.15 m (7 ft) high were constructed in the United Kingdom. Its extensive use came about after World War II when nearly the whole of Europe was in vast housing need. The unprecedented demand for bricks, and the subsequent inability of the brick-making industry to provide bricks in sufficient quantity, led to the adoption of no-fines concrete as a construction material since it required considerably less cement per volume than conventional concrete. Earlier use of no-fines concrete was confined to building construction and other nonpavement applications. The present paper cites the use of no-fines concrete for pavement applications in the United States and Europe.",1995
ELASTOPLASTIC CONSTITUTIVE MODELING OF GRANULAR ASSEMBLY,,ANTIGRANULOCYTES SOLIDS,"A triaxial elasto-plastic stress-strain relationship of a continuum solid derived from a base of granular assembly is presented. It shows a macroscopic material nonlinearity by considering the local geometric nonlinearity of the material on the microscopic level of the granular assembly. For a given strain increment causing both elastic and plastic strain increments in an assembly, the elastic strain is calculated by the known uniform strain theory of granular materials, and the corresponding plastic strain increment is computed from the mechanism resulting from the strain due to slip between particles. Responses of two construction materials, steel and concrete, predicted by the proposed constitutive law are illustrated. Some other well-known physical phenomena like dilatation, necking and the confinement effect are also addressed under various loading cases, including uniaxial tension and compression, cyclic loading, biaxial and triaxial loadings.",1995

Steel reinforcing bars, commonly known as rebar, although extensively used for reinforcement of concrete, are susceptible to corrosion and the rapid deterioration of the structure. A number of other factors including chemical and corrosion resistance, better fatigue performance and increased durability in adverse environments, lower overall life-cycle costs, lighter construction material, potential ease of assembly and installation, reduced costs of transporting modules to site, use of modular construction, design flexibility, and overall lower energy consumption have motivated the investigation of the use of composites in civil infrastructure. The present paper focuses on the results of the use of composites as reinforcements in concrete beams. A description of bond behavior is presented as it relates to predictions made about beam failure, as well as to the determination of key design parameters. The results of beam tests are reported and general conclusions drawn as to the need for an appropriate design methodology rather than the acceptance of the approach determined for steel rebar reinforced concrete beams.",1995
Modifications of sulfur polymer cement (SPC) stabilization and solidification (S/S) process,,,"This paper addresses the effectiveness of using sulfur polymer cement (SPC) as a binder to stabilize/solidify lead-contaminated soils. SPC, which has been used as a construction material because of its excellent resistance to acid and salt environments and its superior water tightness as compared with Portland cement concrete, has recently emerged as a possible alternative binder to stabilize/solidify soils contaminated with hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed wastes. However, it was found that the use of SPC alone could not satisfactorily stabilize/solidify lead-contaminated soils. Nevertheless, it was shown that additives, such as sodium sulfide or sodium sulfite, could be used to greatly enhance the ability of SPC to react chemically with lead contaminants, and physicochemically to bind these compounds. These enable us significantly to lower the leachability (e.g, from 77.8 mg Pb/l to 1.28 mg Pb/l in EPA TCLP extract) of the SPC-treated wastes to the point where they can be recycled as some form of construction material.",1995
"ROCK MASS CHARACTERIZATION OF WADI-MUJIB DAM SITE, CENTRAL JORDAN",,,"This paper assesses the rock mass characterisation of the dam site and reservoir area of Wadi Mujib in central Jordan by means of the rock mass classification systems rock mass rating (RMR) and the Barton tunnelling index (Q). The linear relationships between the RMR and Q ratings obtained from both borecores and scanlines are quite similar and indicate good correlation. The results obtained showed that the foundation rocks are of good geomechanical quality, whereas the geomechanical quality of the rock masses constituting the dam abutments exhibit fair quality. The improvement of rock mass quality towards the foundation area was also proved by a seismic refraction survey, which indicated that the foundation rocks are characterised by high longitudinal velocities compared with the dam abutment rocks. Therefore, the foundation rocks are favourable for the construction of both concrete gravity and fill type dams. However, based on the rock mass conditions of the dam abutments and, in addition, other factors that affect the selection of the dam type (such as seismicity) it would be preferable to construct a rockfill dam, due not only to the aforementioned conditions but also to the availability of construction material around the dam site.",1994
OBSERVATIONS FROM THE 12-OCTOBER-1992 DAHSHOUR EARTHQUAKE IN EGYPT,SEISMIC RISK; DAHSHOUR EARTHQUAKE; EGYPT,,"An earthquake of local magnitude 5.3 (duration magnitude M(d)) on the Richter Scale occurred at Dahshour, 18 km south of Cairo, Egypt, on Monday, 12 October 1992 at 3:09 pm (local time). Numerous aftershocks followed the main event during the following weeks with magnitude up to 4.3. The earthquake occurred in an area that has had no recent seismic activity, and affected many cities in Egypt. Many buildings and monuments were severely damaged or collapsed. Modern concrete skeletal structures suffered minor nonstructural damage. Earthquake physical damage was estimated at about one billion U.S. Dollars. The severity of the damage was mainly due to poor construction materials and detailing, aging, inferior workmanship, and inadequate maintenance. Egypt was generally considered to be an area of moderate seismic activity. In 1989, earthquake provisions were first introduced in the Egyptian Code of Practice for Reinforced Concrete Structures only. The earthquake clearly showed the urgent need for an assessment and rehabilitation program to mitigate seismic risk hazard in existing structures. In addition, future development planning, and earthquake preparedness strategies should implement lessons learned from the event. In this paper, an overview discussion about the observations from the 12 October earthquake is presented.",1994
CONSTRUCTIVE SLUDGE MANAGEMENT - REUTILIZATION OF MUNICIPAL SEWAGE-SLUDGE IN PORTLAND-CEMENT MORTARS,SEWAGE SLUDGE; BLENDED CEMENT; MORTARS; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; TENSILE STRENGTH,CONCRETE; WASTES; ASH; SOLIDIFICATION,"Sludges produced by the treatment of municipal sewage wastes are becoming increasingly difficult to dispose of because the quantity of sludge is increasing due to an increase in population and sewered areas. Many sludge disposal alternatives such as agricultural use, landfilling, marine disposal and incineration, etc, have adverse environmental impacts. There is a resulting increase of interest in reuse of sludge by incorporation into construction materials. In the present study, properties of digested, dewatered, dried and pulverized sludge blended Portland cement mortars are investigated. Sludge was used as replacement for 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 percent by weight of the cement. The results indicate that initial and final setting times are longer with an increase of sludge. The mortar samples cast in standard moulds were cured for periods of 3, 7, 14 and 28 days before testing for compressive and tensile strength. The addition of 40 percent sludge caused the initial and final setting times of mortar to increase about 19 fold and 35 fold compared to control mortar with a water to cement ratio of 0.5. The effects of pulverized sludge on the Le Chatelier expansion and specific surface area of mortar are not significant. The addition of sludge adversely affected the compressive and tensile strength development. For 5 percent replacement of cement by pulverized sludge, the compressive and tensile strengths reduced by 32 and 38 percent, respectively.",1994
PROBABILISTIC DERIVATION OF OVERSTRESS FOR OVERHEAD DISTRIBUTION IN-LINE STRUCTURES,POLE STRUCTURE; STRUCTURAL OVERSTRESS; CALCULATED RISK; TIME-TO-FAILURE DISTRIBUTION; WIND DISTRIBUTION; PRESSURE; OVERTURNING MOMENT; RESISTING MOMENT,,"In 1991, the International Electrotechnical Commission published Technical Report 826, ''Loading and Strength of Overhead Transmission Lines''. The report proposes probabilistic methods in the design of lines operating above 45 kV. This paper shows how probability techniques can be applied to low and medium voltage distribution and high voltage sub-transmission lines which use self-supporting single-pole structures. Line regulations and codes of practice have generally used deterministic multiplying factors in the design of the strength-loads applicable to overhead distribution and sub-transmission line structures. Such an approach, based on a worst case scenario, applies a continuously sustained maximized stress over some indefinite design life. This is unrealistic and a waste of resources. In contrast, the probabilistic concept uses overlapping distributions in which the randomized stress induced by wind pressure is matched to the resisting strength of a pole structure. In this way a risk load is evaluated which optimizes structural strength and enhances the economic utility of the asset. Specific to the work is the inclusion of the degeneration bf pole strength with age. This is important in distribution systems where wood is the most common construction material. The modeling uses Monte Carlo simulation to establish a failure risk of a line structure within a design return period and a life. Input to the model involves the static load imposed by line conductors and their ancillaries, random gust wind pressures (modeled by a Gumbel distribution), and a 3-parameter Weibull distribution to describe the dispersion of strength and degradation of the material. The pole overturning (wind) moment is compared to the degrading resisting (strength) bending-moment over daily or monthly intervals related to a designated life time. The work, for a large electric utility, analyzes treated hardwood and steel-reinforced concrete poles for new works, with emphasis on urban and semi-urban area construction. In the context of an urban and semi-rural environment, cost reductions in the order of 10% to 15% can be achieved.",1994
THE NUMERICAL-SIMULATION OF THE IMPACT PHENOMENA IN NAIL PENETRATION,,,"Powder actuated fastening is a quick and cost efficient method to fasten building materials together. In this method, a nail is placed in a hand-held tool and driven by a flying piston into hard construction materials such as steel and concrete. The piston is propelled by the explosive force of a powder cartridge. Numerical simulations are used to help engineers design better powder actuated tools and fastenings. These simulations require the numerical treatment of stress wave propagation, large strain, strain-rate material behaviour and sliding contact and impact. In this paper, the numerical contact algorithm implemented in an explicit dynamic finite element program used to simulate nail penetrations is described. The results of several example simulations are presented.",1994
CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS MADE WITH COAL COMBUSTION BY-PRODUCTS,FLY ASH; BOTTOM ASH; MASONRY; CONCRETE; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH; CURING TEMPERATURE; DENSITY,,"A research program at the Center for By-Products Utilization, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, is being conducted to develop new low-cost construction materials primarily using coal combustion by-products. This paper reports results of research performed to develop concrete mixture proportions information using fly ash and bottom ash in masonry products. The influence of different types, amounts, and sources of ash on compressive strength and bulk density of concrete are given in this paper. The influence of curing temperature as well as using bottom ash as a replacement of natural aggregates is also reported. It is concluded that low-cost construction materials can be reliably developed using coal combustion by-products with potentially large savings to producers and consumers.",1994
RADIATION EXPOSURE AT THE HIGH BACKGROUND AREA AT MANAVALAKURICHI - THE CHANGING TRENDS,,,"Large-scale surface mining and refilling of the mined areas with monazite-free tailings have reduced the external radiation fields by an order of magnitude, at some locations at the natural high background areas situated in the coastal regions of peninsular India. Significant reduction by a factor of 3 has been observed in the airborne activity due to lower emanation of thoron (220 Rn) at the refilled areas. The thatched huts in the area are giving way to brick and concrete structures, thus radically altering the indoor exposures. The exposure due to gamma radiation from the external surroundings was reduced by a factor of 4 due to the shielding by the construction materials. 220 Rn levels as high as 420 Bq m-3 have been observed in some of the mud houses. Significant levels of 232 Th and 228 Ra were found in the urine samples collected from the adults residing in a village, situated in the high background area.",1994
A LARGE-DIAMETER TRANSMISSION-LINE FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS,,,"The authors have developed a novel, large diameter transmission line system to provide fundamental dielectric data to assist studies of subsurface radar applications to structural concrete. The theoretical background is outlined, together with construction details of the transmission line and the procedures used for the analysis of results. Time domain and frequency domain analysis procedures were adopted, and experimental results have been supplemented by numerical modelling using a finite element approach to confirm the validity of die analytical procedures and to clarify some experimental anomalies. Two versions of the transmission line have been fabricated. One is suitable for testing fluids, whilst the other accommodates hardened concrete specimens which can be removed for conditioning. Following validation with air and distilled water, results are presented for a range of oil-water emulsion compositions designed to simulate concrete for laboratory studies and for concrete samples at various levels of moisture content.",1993
PREDICTING THE SERVICE LIFE OF CONCRETE,ACCELERATED TESTS; CONCRETES; MATHEMATICAL MODELS; RELIABILITY; STOCHASTIC PROCESSES,,"An objective of service-life methodology is to develop a technical basis for predicting the useful life of concrete. Several methods have been used for predicting the service lives of construction materials. They include a) estimates based on experience, b) deductions from performance of similar materials, c) accelerated testing, d) mathematical modeling based on the chemistry and physics of degradation processes, and e) applications of reliability and stochastic concepts. These methods are discussed in this paper, along with some examples of their applications.",1993
LATERAL DISTRIBUTION OF LOADS IN ONE-WAY CONTINUOUS NAVY PIER DECKS,,,"Distribution of wheel loads in concrete bridges has been addressed by AASHTO using the effective-width concept, whereby the load is assumed to be laterally distributed over a width E function of the span and limited to 2.1 m (7 ft). A military handbook addressing flat-slab pier-deck design to distribute truck-crane outrigger loads recommends following these guidelines, although it recognizes that resulting designs are overly conservative. An initial finite element-parameter study is carried out in an attempt to determine more appropriate effective-widths values. Inservice pier tests are conducted to corroborate the numerical predictions. From these analyses and test results, a one-third scale laboratory model using an effective-width value of 3 m (10 ft) is designed, constructed, and tested. Classical plate-theory solutions and finite element analyses using various edge conditions, cracked and uncracked deck properties, as well as point and patch loads are completed. Analyses and tests results confirmed that 'effective-width values for reinforced concrete slabs can often be doubled over current AASHTO allowables. For Navy pier-deck designs where large, truck-mounted cranes dominate load requirements, this will result in higher load capacity, longer spans, and less construction materials.",1993
NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE INFLUENCE OF GEOMETRY AND CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS ON URBAN STREET CLIMATE,,,"A numerical model is developed for simulating the nocturnal cooling of the ground and walls in typical urban canyons. The model is capable of dealing with homogeneous as well as inhomogeneous (layered) soil and wall substrates. Experiments carried out with the model show that the difference in the thermal properties of urban asphalt and concrete pavements and the rural dry soil substrate could create urban/rural surface temperature differences of up to 4-5K. In narrow cross-section canyons, the influence of geometry on the street microclimate increases and becomes dominant for aspect ratios exceeding 2. The external surfaces of insulated canyon walls cool drastically overnight and therefore induce lower heat island intensities than conventional wall constructions. Some findings of the numerical investigations are corroborated with available nocturnal cooling field observations.",1993
PLACEMENT-ORIENTED DESIGN AND DELIVERY OF CONCRETE REINFORCEMENT,,,"The use of reinforced concrete in the United States is steadily increasing, and with it the need for designed and fabricated reinforcing bars (rebar). Traditionally, the detailing of the rebar is done by the fabricator, who is required to have the shop drawings approved by the civil engineer in charge of the structural design. Subsequently, the rebar is fabricated and shipped to the site where an independent subcontractor places the rebar according to the detail design. Research has shown that the delivery of construction material is strongly related to the productivity of construction processes, such as laying rebar. However, traditional rebar fabrication and shipment is geared towards minimizing the set-up time of the rebar bending machine. As a result, rebar is cut, bent, and bundled according to shape and size without considering the sequence of placing the bars. This paper presents an alternative way to design and deliver concrete reinforcement that is based on computer integration and feature-based design concept. Detailing data generated with CAD software is used to create rebar placement plans, shipping schedules, and assignments of lay-down area on the construction site. Based on experiences with the application of the system, steps necessary for its implementation are discussed.",1993
SYMBOLISM IN BUILDING-MATERIALS - SELF-PRESENTATIONAL AND COGNITIVE COMPONENTS,,,"The symbolic significance of building materials was used as a vehicle to explore theoretical issues pertaining to environmental symbolism. Four studies assessed the meaning and social symbolism inherent in six construction materials: brick, concrete block, weathered wood, stucco, flagstone, and wooden shingles. Data from the first two studies supported a symbolic interactionist analysis of material symbolism. The presence of different materials on the exterior of homes conveyed information about the social identity of the homeowner on three orthogonal dimensions: creative expression, interpersonal style, and social class. The final two studies explored cognitive mechanisms underpinning such symbolism. Results indicated that each building material was associated with a unique character or ''personality'' that became attributed to the homeowner only when the homeowner actively chose the material. Building materials may be regarded as having both intrinsic meanings and culturally relative meanings that homeowners employ in the process of defining social identity.",1993
UTILIZATION OF COAL-GASIFICATION SLAG - OVERVIEW,,,"Coal gasification generates solid waste materials in relatively large quantities, and their disposal can represent a significant expense. For example, a 100-MW power plant based on IGCC technology using 1000 tons of 10% ash coal per day may generate over 110 tons/day of solid waste or slag, consisting of vitrified mineral matter and unburned carbon. As coal gasification technologies, considered clean and efficient methods of utilizing coal, find increasing applications for power generation or chemical feedstock production, it becomes imperative that slag utilization methods be developed, tested, and commercialized in order to address the costly problems associated with its disposal as solid waste. This chapter presents an overview of the experimental work that has been conducted to characterize samples of slag from various gasifiers and to identify and test a number of commercial applications for their utilization, and discusses various issues with regard to slag utilization. In the course of examining various utilization applications for a number of coal gasification slags that parallel those developed for fly ash, a better understanding of slag as a construction material has been achieved. The applications tested include the use of slag as an aggregate for road construction, cement concrete and asphalt concrete, and production of lightweight aggregate from slag.",1993
THE GEOLOGY OF THE LESOTHO-HIGHLANDS WATER PROJECT WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE DURABILITY OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS,,,"The Lesotho Highlands Water Project is situated in the Kingdom of Lesotho and the adjoining north-eastern part of the Orange Free State Province of the RSA in an area underlain by Triassic and Jurassic basalts of the Lesotho Formation and Triassic sandstones and mudrocks of the Karoo Sequence. The Project will consist of a series of dams and tunnels to convey water from the Lesotho Highlands to the industrial centre of the Republic of South Africa. The geological setting of the project area and some engineering geological properties of the underlying stratigraphic horizons is discussed. The geotechnical properties of the different rock types are discussed with special reference to their use as concrete aggregate. The durability of basalt is primarily determined by the amount of secondary smectite clays present in the rock. These clays occur as discrete grains or as intergrowths with other secondary minerals disseminated throughout the rock. The clays originate from the deuteric alteration of primary glass, pyroxene, olivine and rarely plagioclase and also occur as infillings of amygdales. The durability of the sedimentary rocks is a function of their dimensional change with variability in moisture content and also the degree of cementation between grains.",1993
HIGH-URANIUM ZIRCON FROM CHERNOBYL LAVAS,CHERNOBYL; ZIRCON; URANIUM,,"Crystalline zircon (ZrSiO4) have been discovered during detailed examination of the so called ''Chernobyl lavas'' in the destroyed 4th unit of the nuclear power plant. The zircon was formed during interaction between the melting nuclear fuel and construction materials (metallic zirconium, concrete, sand). The mineralogical characteristics and chemical compositions are being studied. It is shown that zircon has increased elementary cell parameters (A0 = 6.617 +/- 0.002, C0 = 5.990 +/- 0.002) and high contents of uranium (6.1-12.9 percent). The morphologic relations between the zircon and other phases in the lavas including uranium oxides, zirconium oxides, and metallic zirconium are being studied. The principal mode of formation of the high uranium zircon is presented.",1993
SORPTION OF TRITIUM AND TRITIATED-WATER ON CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS,,,"Sorption and desorption of tritium (HT) and tritiated water (HTO) on materials to be used in the construction of fusion facilities were studied. In ca. 24-hour exposures in argon or room air, metal samples sorbed 8-200-mu-Ci/m2 (1 Ci = 3.7 x 10(10) Bq) of tritium from atmospheres of 5-9 Ci/m3 HT, and non-metallic samples sorbed 60-800-mu-Ci/m2 from atmospheres of 14 Ci/m3 HT. Sorption of HTO varied much more widely than HT sorption for different samples, ranging from 4-mu-Ci/m2 for glass to 1 300 000-mu-Ci/m2 for concrete samples, in 24-hour exposures to 1 Ci/m3 HTO in room air. Time dependence of desorption in dry air showed a rapid initial process and a slower secondary process.",1992
OPTIMIZATION OF REINFORCED FIBROUS CONCRETE BEAMS,BEAMS (SUPPORTS); FLEXURAL STRENGTH; METAL FIBERS; MICROCOMPUTERS; OPTIMIZATION; REINFORCED CONCRETE; SHEAR STRENGTH,,"Steel fiber reinforced concrete is increasingly used as a construction material. Studies have shown that steel fibers can be used to increase the bending moment capacity and shear strength of reinforced concrete beams. A computer algorithm that analyzes the combined contribution of steel fibers to flexural and shear strengths of reinforced fiber concrete beams is presented. The algorithm conducts a systematic direct search in the space of six variables-beam width, beam depth, fiber content, bending reinforcing bars, shear stirrups, and stirrup spacing-to yield an optimum solution for a given cost objective function. The algorithm can simplify the combined use of concrete, conventional reinforcement, and steel fibers as construction materials.",1992
REUSE OF WASTE-WATER SLUDGE IN MANUFACTURING NONCONVENTIONAL CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS - AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO ULTIMATE SLUDGE DISPOSAL,SLUDGE; INCINERATION; LIGHTWEIGHT AGGREGATE; CEMENTITIOUS BINDER; MORTAR; PROPERTIES; COMPRESSIVE STRENGTH,ASH; CEMENT; CONCRETE,"The increased requirements for the treatment of wastewater, coupled with industrial growth, have created a need to treat and dispose of an over-proportional sludge volume. At the same time, increasingly stringent regulations have resulted in limitations on the ultimate sludge disposal options. In highly urbanized municipalities, scarcity of landfill sites and increasing environmental awareness pose major public concern on the disposal of sludge. This situation has prompted the interest in recycling and reuse of sludge into building and construction materials as a means of alleviating sludge disposal problems. This paper presents the results of the use of wastewater sludge to produce lightweight aggregates and cementitious binder as non-conventional construction materials. Lightweight coarse aggregates were produced from the incineration of sludge-clay mixture. Test results of porosity, specific gravity, bulk density, ten percent fines, water absorption and concrete strength, indicate that clay-blended sludge could be used to produce lightweight aggregates. The feasibility of using dried sludge mixed with lime as a cementitious binder after incineration was also studied. Evaluation of the mortar cube strengths shows that it is possible to produce masonry binder from sludge that will satisfy the strength requirements in the ASTM standard for masonry cement.",1992
DETERMINATION OF THERMAL-DIFFUSIVITY OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS,THERMAL DIFFUSIVITY; CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS; SHORT CYLINDER; HEAT CONDUCTION; LABORATORY TESTING,,"This paper describes a simple and rapid laboratory method for the measurement of the thermal diffusivity of construction materials by heat conduction in short cylindrical specimens. The technique is relatively simple and requires only the measurement of the temperature history at the midpoint of the specimen during heating and cooling in a constant thermal bath using an imbedded thermocouple. A unique theoretical solution is produced for transient heat conduction in a short cylinder which permits the deduction of the thermal diffusivity by curve fitting the experimental data to the theoretical curve. The solution takes into account the variation of cylinder heights and is specialized for specimens of 100 mm fixed diameter and conductivities in the range of 0.5 to 3.0 W/m.K. This solution is commonly applicable to construction materials such as asphaltic concrete, portland cement concrete, portland cement, and brick. Diffusivity is determined by a three-point fitting between experimental data and theoretical solution that verifies the consistency of the value obtained. Experiments for three types of materials, namely, asphaltic concrete, portland cement concrete, and hardened portland cement, are performed to validate the procedure.",1991

FIBER-REINFORCED CONCRETE - A VERSATILE CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL,,,"Simultaneously with the development of new/alternative building materials, effort is being made to achieve a breakthrough in construction technology. By optimizing the material, labour and time component of the cost side by side with prefabrication, composites, building systems and management, work is on to enhance the strength and performance of building components using various types of fibres, organic and inorganic.

MAPPING AND MEASURING BUILDINGS IN THE CANOPY BOUNDARY-LAYER IN 10 UNITED-STATES CITIES,,,"This study reports on development of a method for inventorying characteristics of urban buildings with special emphasis on their surface construction materials. The work was conducted in response to stated needs from scientists engaged in acid rain damage studies, urban meterologists interested in the condition of the canopy boundary layer of cities, and others involved in investigations of the physical character of the urban environment. In several instances, these scientists have had little choice but to derive physical (or morphological) characteristics of the city from available spatial data on featuring functional (rather than physical) aspects. The method developed, applicable globally, could support urban meterological studies. The cities examined were: Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Houston, Denver, Seattle, and Sacramento. All exhibit a wide variety of urban landscapes, building types, and construction materials. High altitude color infrared aerial photographs (at Ames Research Center) were employed to delimit urban terrain zones prior to visiting each city for making direct observations and measurements. Criteria for zone delimitation are morphological and consist of building construction type, venting characteristics, age, density, and related street patterns items recorded in the field survey were: building dimensions, height, type of roof, venting, and building surface material (e.g., stone, brick, concrete, wood). The data - aggregated by urban terrain zone - reveal, for example, that wall and roof surfaces in areas of tall, densely spaced buildings exceed the ground surface. Conversely, wall and roof areas of low density single-family detached houses form only a small proportion of the ground surface area. These three-dimensional data provide a far more detailed view of the canopy boundary layer in cities than is possible using two-dimensional surface measurements alone. Data analysis also reveals that many of the urban terrain zones (especially those in commercial and industrial areas) are remarkably similar regardless of the city's location. As expected, the dominance of local building materials is more important in houses and other small buildings.",1991
CONCRETE SPALLING - CONTROLLED FIRE TESTS AND REVIEW,FIRE INVESTIGATION; ARSON; SPALLING; GASOLINE,,"The relationship of various fire conditions to the explosive removal of concrete chips from the surface of slabs (spalling) is explored by a review of the literature and controlled fire experiments. The review includes the many causes of spalling and the constituents of concrete as they relate to spalling. New experiments show that when up to two litres of gasoline are poured onto a slab and ignited, no spalling results. Conversely, small fires of normal construction materials result in extensive spalling accompanied by darkened areas at the perimeter of the spall. Explanations for these results are offered.",1991
