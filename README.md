[Text mining](code/TextXD-Hackaton.ipynb) of scientific data in python by Dani Ushizima and Alex Nascimento

Questions
---------

1.	Scientific papers about construction materials: tokens frequency and semantics
2.	Concrete composition over time
3.	Environment aspects of concrete production

Data
----

1.	Go to Wikipedia for key words about subject, here **construction materials**
2.	Query [Web of Science](http://www.webofknowledge.com/)
	-	construction materials concrete
	-	download 387 TAK

Main Steps
----------

1.	Data clean up, e.g. eliminate non-English text, check which fields are more promising - full of NAs for kw
	-	deal with [stopwords](https://pythonspot.com/nltk-stop-words/) and be aware of dependencies: nltk, punkt -
2.	Explore word embedding models in Python with gensim
3.	Extract features produced through the word2vec model
4.	Visualization the WEMs

Why concrete?
-------------

“Ancient Roman concrete structures: revealing the secrets of its resilience through data science”, and its impact to the development of high performance concrete. Our scientific question is: why is the ancient Roman concrete more resilient than the modern concrete? There is no information on how rubble caementa influences in the toughening mechanisms that reinforce the durability of such concrete. In order to discover the secrets of ancient Roman concrete structures, we propose to investigate archaeological samples using advanced X-ray light sources generated by particle accelerators (synchrotron). These cutting-edge techniques generate a large amount of data, so we propose to use and contribute to advanced algorithms, currently explored at BIDS, e.g. those within ImageXD (e.g. 3D image analysis), GraphXD (e.g. probabilistic graphical models) and TextXD (e.g. manuscript content summarization) initiatives. Results from this R&D project has profound implications to many disciplines such as Civil Engineering, Computer Vision, Statistics, History, and Environmental Sciences. Collected data contains several archaeological (67 B.C. to A.D. 64) samples previously submerged in the Italian Mediterranean sea; these samples have been studied using X-ray imaging for non-destructive inspection of internal microstructures under UCB Roy W. Carlson Distinguished Professor [Paulo Monteiro](https://www.ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/monteiro) leadership at UCB Civil Engineering.
